<div class="line_en">Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two–thirds of his body into the air from time to time and "sniffing around," then proceeding again-for he was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad-for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes-without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree–trunk. A brown spotted lady–bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady–bug, lady–bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and she took wing and went off to see about it -- which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，林子深处有只鸟儿叫了起来，另一只发出应和。随后又听见一只啄木鸟啄树的声音。清淡的晨光渐渐发白，各种声音也随之稠密起来，大地万物，一派生机。大自然从沉睡中醒来，精神抖擞地把一片奇景展现在这惊奇的孩子的眼底。一条小青虫从一片带露的叶子上爬过来，不时地把大半截身子翘在空中，四处“嗅一嗅”，接着又向前爬——汤姆说它是在打探。这条小虫自动爬近他身边时，他像一块石头一样凝然不动，满心希望它能爬得再近些。那条小虫一会儿继续向他爬过来，一会儿又好像改变了主意，打算往别处去。他的希望也随之一会儿高涨，一会儿低落。后来，小虫在空中翘起身子，考虑良久，终于爬到汤姆腿上来，在他身上周游，于是他心里充满了欢乐——因为这就表示他将要得到一套新打扮——毫无疑问，是一套光彩夺目的海盗制服。这时，不知道从什么地方来了一大群蚂蚁，正忙着搬运东西；其中一只正用两条前肢抓住一只有自己身体五倍大的死蜘蛛，奋力往前拖，直拖着它爬上了树干。一只背上有棕色斑点的花大姐趴在一片草叶的叶尖，汤姆俯下身子，对它说：“花大姐，花大姐，快回家，你的家里着火啦，你的娃娃找妈妈。”于是它就拍着翅儿飞走了，回家去看到底怎么了——汤姆对此一点也不感到奇怪，因为他早就知道这种小虫子容易相信火灾的事情，头脑又简单，被捉弄过不止一次了。不久，又有一只金龟子飞过来，不屈不挠地在搬一个粪球；汤姆碰了一下这小东西，看它把腿缩进身体装死。这时很多鸟儿叽叽喳喳闹得更欢了。有一只猫鹊——一种北方的学舌鸟——在汤姆头顶上的一棵大树上落下来，模仿着它附近别的鸟儿的叫声，叫得欢天喜地。随后又有一只樫鸟尖叫着疾飞而下，像一团一闪而过的蓝色火焰，落到一根小树枝上，汤姆几乎一伸手就能够到它。它歪着脑袋，十分好奇地打量着这几位不速之客；还有一只灰色的松鼠和一只狐狸类的大东西匆匆跑来，一会儿坐着观察这几个孩子，一会儿又冲他们叫几声。这些野生动物也许以前从未见过人类，所以它们根本不知道该不该害怕。此时自然界的万物全都醒来，充满了活力。这儿那儿，一道道阳光如长矛一般从茂密的树叶中直刺下来，几只蝴蝶扇着翅膀，在翩翩起舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck still slept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨，汤姆一觉醒来，迷迷糊糊不知身在何方。他坐起来，揉揉眼，向周围看了看。很快他想了起来。此时正值凉爽的、灰蒙蒙的黎明时分，林子里一片静谧，给一种甜蜜的安息与和平的气氛围扰着。树叶儿一动也不动，没有任何声音打扰大自然的酣眠。露珠儿还逗留在树叶和草叶上。一层白色的灰烬盖在那堆火上，一缕淡淡的烟直飘向天空。而乔和哈克都还睡得正香。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad–hearted, and ravenous; and they soon had the camp–fire blazing up again. Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river–bank and threw in their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass, a couple of sun–perch and a small catfish-provisions enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh–water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open–air sleeping, open–air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们回到露营地时，神采奕奕，兴致勃勃，却也饥肠辘辘；不久他们把那篝火又拨旺了。哈克在附近发现了一眼清泉，孩子们就用阔大的橡树叶和胡桃树叶做成杯子，他们觉得这泉水有股子森林的清香，完全可以取代咖啡。乔正在切咸肉片做早餐，汤姆和哈克让他稍候片刻；他们来到河边，相中了一个僻静之处，垂下鱼钩，不长时间就有了收获。还没到让乔等得不耐烦的时候，他们就拿回来几条漂亮的石首鱼，一对鲈鱼和一条小鲶鱼——这些鱼足够一大家人饱餐一顿。他们把鱼和咸肉放到一块煮，结果让人惊讶的是：鱼的味道竟然这么鲜美。他们不知道淡水鱼越趁活烧吃，味道越鲜美；另外，他们也没有想到露天睡觉、户外运动、洗澡以及饥饿会使食欲大增。他们并不明白饥者口中尽佳肴的道理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆弄醒了另外两个强盗，他们大叫一声，嘻嘻哈哈地跑开了；两分钟以后，他们就脱得赤条条的，跳进白沙滩上那片清澈透底的水里互相追逐，滚抱嬉戏。宽阔的河流对面，远远的地方，就是那个村庄，而他们并不想念。可能是一阵湍流也可能是一股上涨的潮水，冲走了他们的小木筏。他们却为此感到庆幸。因为没有了木筏，就像是烧毁了他们与文明世界间的桥梁，斩断了他们回返的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape–vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃罢早饭，他们就往树荫底下随便一倒，哈克抽了一袋烟；然后大家往树林里去，去探险。他们信步走去，一路跨朽木，涉杂林，穿过高大的树木林，这些大树披垂着一根根葡萄藤，好像王冠上垂下来的流苏。他们时不时地遇到一些幽僻的地方，地面长满青草，绽放着鲜花，宛如块块镶着宝石的绿色地毯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag, and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This took dim shape, presently-it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the Red–Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak his thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看到了很多令人欣喜的东西，不过并没有什么稀奇古怪的玩意儿。他们发现这个岛大约有三英里长，四分之一英里宽，离河岸最近的地方只有一条狭窄的水道相隔，不足二百码宽。他们差不多每个钟头就游上一次泳，所以等他们回到宿营地时，已过去了半个下午。他们饿坏了，顾不得停下来捉鱼来吃，对着冷火腿，就是一番狼吞虎咽，吃罢就躺到荫凉下说话。说着说着就断断续续了，终于他们止住了话头。周遭的寂静、森林中的肃穆以及孤独感，慢慢地对这几个孩子的情绪发生了作用。他们开始沉思默想。一种莫名的渴望渐渐爬上他们心头——那是越来越强烈的思乡情绪。连赤手大盗费恩都在缅怀他从前睡觉的台阶和那些大空桶。但是他们对这种软弱感到害臊，没有一个人有勇气把心事公诸于众。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started, glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一段时间，几个孩子隐隐约约地听到远处有一种奇怪的声响，就像你不特别留神时听到的钟摆的滴嗒滴嗒声。但后来这种神秘的声响越来越大，他们不得不弄清楚。孩子们愣了一下，互相对望一眼，接着像在侧耳细听。过了好久没有声音，只有死一般的寂静；后来，一阵沉闷的隆隆响声从远处滚荡而来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一下子跳起来，赶忙朝镇子方向的岸边跑去。他们拨开河边的灌木丛，偷眼往水面观瞧。那只摆渡用的小蒸汽船在镇子下游大约一英里的地方，顺流而下。宽大的甲板上像是站满了人。另外有好多小船在渡船附近划动，漂来漂去，可孩子们却吃不准船上的人在干什么。后来，渡船边突地冒出来一大股白烟，它似闲云一般弥散升腾开来。与此同时，那种沉闷的声音又灌进他们的耳鼓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.</div>

<div class="line_en">As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon-from their point of view. But when the shadows of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout "feeler" as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization-not right now, but --</div>
