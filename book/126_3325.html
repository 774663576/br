<div class="line_en">Sara soon made new friends in the school. Some little rich girls are not very nice children -- they think they are important because they have money and lots of expensive things. But Sara was different. She liked beautiful dresses and dolls, but she was more interested in people, and books, and telling stories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉在学校里很快就交上了新朋友。一些家里有钱的小姑娘并不是好孩子——她们因为家里有钱，自己拥有很多贵重的东西而觉得自己很了不起。可萨拉不是这样。她也喜欢漂亮的衣服和洋娃娃，可更喜欢跟人们交往，喜欢读书，喜欢讲故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

So now Sara was more important than Lavinia, and Lavinia did not like that.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Sara is so clever!" Lavinia often said. "Sara is so good at French! Her dresses are so beautiful, and she can sing so well! And she is so rich! Of course Miss Minchin likes her best!"</div>
