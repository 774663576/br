<div class="line_en">"Keep the blanket around you," the boy said. "You'll not fish without eating while I'm alive." "Then live a long time and take care of yourself," the old man said, "What are we eating?" "Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew." The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set. "Who gave this to you?" "Martin. The owner." "I must thank him."</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep. "Wake up old man," the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man's knees. The old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled. "What have you got?" he asked. "Supper," said the boy. "We're going to have supper." "I'm not very hungry." "Come on and eat. You can't fish and not eat. "I have," the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it. Then he started to fold the blanket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩留他一个人睡着。当他回来的时候，老人仍在熟睡中。「醒醒吧，老先生！」男孩把手放在老人一边的膝盖上说。老人睁开了眼，过了好一会儿才醒过来，他笑了。「你弄到些什么东西？」他问。「晚餐。」小孩说：「我们要吃晚饭了。」「我并不很饿。」「快来吃嘛！你不能够光打渔而不吃东西呀。」「我有吃。」老人说着站起来，把报纸迭起来收好。然后开始折毯子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thanked him already," the boy said. "You don't need to thank him." "I'll give him the belly meat of a big fish," the old man said. "Has he done this for us more than once?" "I think so." "I must give him something more than the belly meat then. He is very thoughtful for us." "He sent two beers." "I like the beer in cans best." "I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I take back the bottles." "That's very kind of you," the old man said. "Should we eat?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我已经谢过他了，」男孩说：「你不需要再谢他了。」「我会把大鱼的肚子肉给他，」老人说：「他这么招待我们好像不止一次了吧？」「我想是的。」「那么，除了鱼肚子肉，我还得给他一些别的东西。他对我们真是太体贴了。」「他还送了两瓶啤酒呢！」「我最喜欢罐装啤酒。」「我知道，但是这是瓶装的海之味啤酒，我会把瓶子退回去。」「你能这样做真是太好了！」老人说：「我们可以开始吃了吧？」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've been asking you to," the boy told him gently. "I have not wished to open the container until you were ready." "I'm ready now," the old man said. "I only needed time to wash." Where did you wash? The boy thought. The village water supply was two streets down the road. I must have water here for him, the boy thought, and soap and a good towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and another blanket. "Your stew is excellent," the old man said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我一直在等你吃啊，」男孩温和地说：「在你没准备好要吃之前，我不想把饭盒打开。」「我已经准备好了，」老人说：「我只是需要一点时间冲洗一下。」你在什么地方洗啊？男孩想。这村庄的水源供应处和这里足足隔了二条街。我得把水端来这儿给他，男孩想，还要再弄块肥皂和一条好的毛巾来。我怎么这么粗心？我还必须给他弄件冬天的衬衫和夹克，还得弄双象样的鞋，再弄条毯子。「这炖肉很好吃，」老人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell me about the baseball," the boy asked him. "In the American League it is the Yankees as I said," the old man said happily. "They lost today," the boy told him. "That means nothing. The great DiMaggio is himself again." "They have other men on the team." "Naturally. But he makes the difference. In the other league, between Brooklyn and Philadelphia I must take Brooklyn. But then I think of Dick Sisler and those great drives in the old park." "There was nothing ever like them. He hits the longest ball I have ever seen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「讲讲棒球赛的事吧！」男孩央求老人。「就如我所说的，在美国职业棒球联盟里，只有洋基队够看。」老人高兴地说着。「他们今天输了，」男孩告诉老人。「那不算什么，伟大的狄玛基欧今天又恢复了昔日雄风。」「可是他们队里还有其它队员啊。」「是没错，可是有他就不同了。在另外一个棒球联盟里，在布鲁克林队和费城队间，我一定会选择布鲁克林队，不过我会想到的是狄克塞斯乐还有他在旧公园球场里所击出的那些好球。」「没有任何人能击出像他那样的球，他击出的球是我看过最远的。」">查看中文翻译</div>
