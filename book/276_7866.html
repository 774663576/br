<div class="line_en">When Jobs was losing his footing at Apple in the summer of 1985, he went for a walk with Alan Kay, who had been at Xerox PARC and was then an Apple Fellow. Kay knew that Jobs was interested in the intersection of creativity and technology, so he suggested they go see a friend of his, Ed Catmull, who was running the computer division of George Lucas's film studio. They rented a limo and rode up to Marin County to the edge of Lucas's Skywalker Ranch, where Catmull and his little computer division were based. "I was blown away, and I came back and tried to convince Sculley to buy it for Apple," Jobs recalled. "But the folks running Apple weren't interested, and they were busy kicking me out anyway."</div>

<div class="line_en">After a few potential purchasers balked in the fall of 1985, Catmull and his colleague Alvy Ray Smith decided to seek investors so that they could buy the division themselves. So they called Jobs, arranged another meeting, and drove down to his Woodside house. After railing for a while about the perfidies and idiocies of Sculley, Jobs proposed that he buy their Lucasfilm division outright. Catmull and Smith demurred: They wanted an investor, not a new owner. But it soon became clear that there was a middle ground: Jobs could buy a majority of the division and serve as chairman but allow Catmull and Smith to run it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1985年秋，在一些潜在买家都躇踌不决时，卡特穆尔和联合创始人阿尔维·雷·史密斯（Alvy Ray Smith）决定自己买下这个部门并寻找投资者。于是，他们打电话找到乔布斯，又安排了一次会面，两人驱车前往乔布斯位于伍德赛德的家中。乔布斯先是抱怨了一通斯卡利的愚蠢和背信弃义，然后提议自己全资买下卢卡斯影业的电脑部门。卡特穆尔和史密斯拒绝了。他们想要一位主要投资者而不是一个新的所有者。不过很快就有了一个折中办法：乔布斯出资购买多数股权，并担任董事长，但由卡特穆尔和史密斯来运营。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wanted to buy it because I was really into computer graphics," Jobs recalled. "I realized they were way ahead of others in combining art and technology, which is what I've always been interested in." He offered to pay Lucas $5 million plus invest another $5 million to capitalize the division as a stand-alone company. That was far less than Lucas had been asking, but the timing was right. They decided to negotiate a deal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs met only once with George Lucas, who warned him that the people in the division cared more about making animated movies than they did about making computers. "You know, these guys are hell-bent on animation," Lucas told him. Lucas later recalled, "I did warn him that was basically Ed and John's agenda. I think in his heart he bought the company because that was his agenda too."</div>

<div class="line_en">The chief financial officer at Lucasfilm found Jobs arrogant and prickly, so when it came time to hold a meeting of all the players, he told Catmull, "We have to establish the right pecking order." The plan was to gather everyone in a room with Jobs, and then the CFO would come in a few minutes late to establish that he was the person running the meeting. "But a funny thing happened," Catmull recalled. "Steve started the meeting on time without the CFO, and by the time the CFO walked in Steve was already in control of the meeting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔布斯提出的条件是，向卢卡斯支付500万美元，然后自己再投入500万美元，从而将这一部门变成独立的公司。这比卢卡斯一直以来所要求的金额低得多，然而时机对乔布斯来说却刚刚好。于是，双方决定通过谈判达成交易。卢卡斯影业的CFO发现乔布斯傲慢又易怒，在谈判各方即将举行会谈时，这位CFO对卡特穆尔说：“我们必须建立正确的等级次序。”他的计划是，将所有人和乔布斯都聚集在一间会议室里，然后这位CFO晚到几分钟，以表明他才是主持会议的人。“但是有趣的事情发生了，”卡特穆尔回忆说，“史蒂夫在CFO缺席的情况下按时开始了这次会议，而当那位CFO走进来时，史蒂夫已经掌握了会议的控制权。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The final agreement was reached in January 1986. It provided that, for his $10 million investment, Jobs would own 70% of the company, with the rest of the stock distributed to Ed Catmull, Alvy Ray Smith, and the thirty-eight other founding employees, down to the receptionist. The division's most important piece of hardware was called the Pixar Image Computer, and from it the new company took its name.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs had always appreciated the virtue of integrating hardware and software, which is what Pixar did with its Image Computer and rendering software. It also produced creative content, such as animated films and graphics. All three elements benefited from Jobs's combination of artistic creativity and technological geekiness. "Silicon Valley folks don't really respect Hollywood creative types, and the Hollywood folks think that tech folks are people you hire and never have to meet," Jobs later said. "Pixar was one place where both cultures were respected."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔布斯一直都很欣赏硬件和软件的整合，皮克斯的图像电脑和渲染软件就是如此。事实上，皮克斯还拥有另一个要素：它制作出色的内容，如动画电影和图像。这三种要素都得益于乔布斯将艺术创意和技术的结合。“硅谷的人并不尊重好莱坞的创意特质，而好莱坞的人则认为技术人员是那些只需雇用而无需见面的人。”乔布斯后来说道，“皮克斯则同时尊重好莱坞和硅谷的文化。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a while Jobs let Catmull and Smith run Pixar without much interference. Every month or so they would gather for a board meeting, usually at NeXT headquarters, where Jobs would focus on the finances and strategy. Nevertheless, by dint of his personality and controlling instincts, Jobs was soon playing a stronger role. He spewed out a stream of ideas-some reasonable, others wacky-about what Pixar's hardware and software could become. And on his occasional visits to the Pixar offices, he was an inspiring presence. "I grew up a Southern Baptist, and we had revival meetings with mesmerizing but corrupt preachers," recounted Alvy Ray Smith. "Steve's got it: the power of the tongue and the web of words that catches people up. We were aware of this when we had board meetings, so we developed signals-nose scratching or ear tugs-for when someone had been caught up in Steve's distortion field and he needed to be tugged back to reality."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一段时间，乔布斯没有进行过多干预，让卡特穆尔和史密斯自行掌管皮克斯。每隔一个月左右，他们就会进行一次董事会会议，通常是在NeXT的总部，乔布斯主要关注财务和战略。然而，由于个性使然以及控制本能的驱使，乔布斯很快就变成了强势的角色，显然比卡特穆尔和史密斯预想的更为强势。针对皮克斯公司硬件和软件的未来，他提出了一堆想法，有的合理，有的古怪。而他虽然只是偶尔前往皮克斯的办公室，但每次出现他都能让人心潮澎湃。“我从小就加入了美南浸信会（Southern Baptist），我们经常同那些生活腐化但却极具蛊惑力的牧师们一起开培灵会。”阿尔维·雷·史密斯说，“史蒂夫显然精于此道，深知口舌的力量和语言的网络能让人陷进去。开董事会会议的时候，大家意识到了这个问题，于是我们发展出一套信号——抓鼻子或拽耳朵，如果有人陷入了史蒂夫的现实扭曲力场，需要被拉回现实，我们就会使用这个信号。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Initially the revenue was supposed to come from the hardware side. The Pixar Image Computer sold for $125,000. The primary customers were animators and graphic designers, but the machine also soon found specialized markets in the medical industry (CAT scan data could be rendered in three-dimensional graphics) and intelligence fields (for rendering information from reconnaissance flights and satellites). Because of the sales to the National Security Agency, Jobs had to get a security clearance, which must have been fun for the FBI agent assigned to vet him. At one point, a Pixar executive recalled, Jobs was called by the investigator to go over the drug use questions, which he answered unabashedly. "The last time I used that..." he would say, or on occasion he would answer that no, he had actually never tried that particular drug.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs wanted to sell Pixar's computers to a mass market, so he had the Pixar folks open up sales offices-for which he approved the design-in major cities, on the theory that creative people would soon come up with all sorts of ways to use the machine. "My view is that people are creative animals and will figure out clever new ways to use tools that the inventor never imagined," he later said. "I thought that would happen with the Pixar computer, just as it did with the Mac." But the machine never took hold with regular consumers. It cost too much, and there were not many software programs for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he had with the hardware, Jobs decided that they should try to find a mass market, rather than just a specialized one, for the software they made. He was never content to aim only at the corporate or high-end specialized markets. "He would have these great visions of how RenderMan could be for everyman," recalled Pam Kerwin, Pixar's marketing director. "He kept coming up with ideas about how ordinary people would use it to make amazing 3 -- D graphics and photorealistic images." The Pixar team would try to dissuade him by saying that RenderMan was not as easy to use as, say, Excel or Adobe Illustrator. Then Jobs would go to a whiteboard and show them how to make it simpler and more user-friendly. "We would be nodding our heads and getting excited and say, 'Yes, yes, this will be great!'" Kerwin recalled. "And then he would leave and we would consider it for a moment and then say, 'What the heck was he thinking!' He was so weirdly charismatic that you almost had to get deprogrammed after you talked to him." As it turned out, average consumers were not craving expensive software that would let them render realistic images. RenderMan didn't take off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔布斯认为，皮克斯的软件也应该像硬件那样，尝试进入大众市场，而不是仅限于专业市场。只针对企业市场或高端专业市场的做法，他从来都没兴趣。“他非常沉迷于大众市场产品，”帕姆·克尔温（Pam Kerwin）说，她是皮克斯的营销总监，“他会构造一些宏大的愿景，想象RenderMan能够怎样为所有人服务。他在会议中不断产生新想法，设想普通用户将如何用它做出惊人的3D图形和逼真的图像。”皮克斯团队试图劝阻他，他们认为RenderMan并不像Excel或AdobeIllustrator那样易于使用。这时，乔布斯就会走到一块白板前，告诉他们如何把它做得更简单，更便于使用。“我们不禁频频点头，兴奋地说：‘是的，是的，这样很棒！’”克尔温回忆说，“等他走了以后，我们又考虑了一会儿，觉得‘他想的都是些什么鬼主意！’他身上的奇特魅力实在是强大，你和他交谈之后就几乎被洗脑了。”后来事实证明，普通消费者对于这种能让他们渲染出逼真图像的昂贵软件并无兴趣。RenderMan没有成功进入大众市场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was, however, one company that was eager to automate the rendering of animators' drawings into color images for film. When Roy Disney led a board revolution at the company that his uncle Walt had founded, the new CEO, Michael Eisner, asked what role he wanted. Disney said that he would like to revive the company's venerable but fading animation department. One of his first initiatives was to look at ways to computerize the process, and Pixar won the contract. It created a package of customized hardware and software known as CAPS, Computer Animation Production System. It was first used in 1988 for the final scene of The Little Mermaid, in which King Triton waves good-bye to Ariel. Disney bought dozens of Pixar Image Computers as CAPS became an integral part of its production.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he graduated from high school, Lasseter enrolled in the animation program at the California Institute of the Arts, founded by Walt Disney. In his summers and spare time, he researched the Disney archives and worked as a guide on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland. The latter experience taught him the value of timing and pacing in telling a story, an important but difficult concept to master when creating, frame by frame, animated footage. He won the Student Academy Award for the short he made in his junior year, Lady and the Lamp, which showed his debt to Disney films and foreshadowed his signature talent for infusing inanimate objects such as lamps with human personalities. After graduation he took the job for which he was destined: as an animator at Disney Studios.</div>

<div class="line_en">Except it didn't work out. "Some of us younger guys wanted to bring Star Wars–level quality to the art of animation, but we were held in check," Lasseter recalled. "I got disillusioned, then I got caught in a feud between two bosses, and the head animation guy fired me." So in 1984 Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith were able to recruit him to work where Star Wars–level quality was being defined, Lucasfilm. It was not certain that George Lucas, already worried about the cost of his computer division, would really approve of hiring a full-time animator, so Lasseter was given the title "interface designer."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jobs and Catmull decided that, in order to show off their hardware and software, Lasseter should produce another short animated film in 1986 for SIGGRAPH, the annual computer graphics conference. At the time, Lasseter was using the Luxo lamp on his desk as a model for graphic rendering, and he decided to turn Luxo into a lifelike character. A friend's young child inspired him to add Luxo Jr., and he showed a few test frames to another animator, who urged him to make sure he told a story. Lasseter said he was making only a short, but the animator reminded him that a story can be told even in a few seconds. Lasseter took the lesson to heart. Luxo Jr. ended up being just over two minutes; it told the tale of a parent lamp and a child lamp pushing a ball back and forth until the ball bursts, to the child's dismay.</div>

<div class="line_en">After Jobs came onto the scene, he and Lasseter began to share their passion for graphic design. "I was the only guy at Pixar who was an artist, so I bonded with Steve over his design sense," Lasseter said. He was a gregarious, playful, and huggable man who wore flowery Hawaiian shirts, kept his office cluttered with vintage toys, and loved cheeseburgers. Jobs was a prickly, whip-thin vegetarian who favored austere and uncluttered surroundings. But they were actually well-suited for each other. Lasseter was an artist, so Jobs treated him deferentially, and Lasseter viewed Jobs, correctly, as a patron who could appreciate artistry and knew how it could be interwoven with technology and commerce.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not all of Jobs's relationships at Pixar were as good. His worst clash came with Catmull's cofounder, Alvy Ray Smith. From a Baptist background in rural north Texas, Smith became a free-spirited hippie computer imaging engineer with a big build, big laugh, and big personality-and occasionally an ego to match. "Alvy just glows, with a high color, friendly laugh, and a whole bunch of groupies at conferences," said Pam Kerwin. "A personality like Alvy's was likely to ruffle Steve. They are both visionaries and high energy and high ego. Alvy is not as willing to make peace and overlook things as Ed was."</div>

Jobs would sometimes assert his dominance at a meeting by saying something outrageous or untrue. Smith took great joy in calling him on it, and he would do so with a large laugh and a smirk. This did not endear him to Jobs.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day at a board meeting, Jobs started berating Smith and other top Pixar executives for the delay in getting the circuit boards completed for the new version of the Pixar Image Computer. At the time, NeXT was also very late in completing its own computer boards, and Smith pointed that out: "Hey, you're even later with your NeXT boards, so quit jumping on us." Jobs went ballistic, or in Smith's phrase, "totally nonlinear." When Smith was feeling attacked or confrontational, he tended to lapse into his southwestern accent. Jobs started parodying it in his sarcastic style. "It was a bully tactic, and I exploded with everything I had," Smith recalled. "Before I knew it, we were in each other's faces-about three inches apart-screaming at each other."</div>

Jobs refused him permission to use some code he had created while at Pixar, which further inflamed their enmity. "Alvy eventually got what he needed," said Catmull, "but he was very stressed for a year and developed a lung infection." In the end it worked out well enough; Microsoft eventually bought Smith's company, giving him the distinction of being a founder of one company that was sold to Jobs and another that was sold to Gates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史密斯最终辞了职，成立了一家新公司，制作数字绘图和图像编辑软件。乔布斯拒绝史密斯使用他在皮克斯时编写的代码，这又进一步加深了彼此的敌意。“阿尔维最终得到了他需要的东西，”卡特穆尔说，“但是，他这一年的压力都很大，还患上了肺部感染。”最后，结果还算不错，微软收购了史密斯的新公司。自己成立的公司，一家卖给乔布斯，另一家卖给盖茨，这样的人也只有史密斯了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ornery in the best of times, Jobs became particularly so when it became clear that all three Pixar endeavors-hardware, software, and animated content-were losing money. "I'd get these plans, and in the end I kept having to put in more money," he recalled. He would rail, but then write the check. Having been ousted at Apple and flailing at NeXT, he couldn't afford a third strike.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，即便在境况最好的时候，乔布斯的脾气也很暴躁。因此，当皮克斯的三项努力——硬件、软件和动画内容——都在赔钱时，乔布斯就越发如此了。“我制订了这些计划，结果却得不停地投钱进去。”他回忆说。他会责骂皮克斯的人，但还是会给他们开支票。已经被苹果驱逐，又被困在NeXT，他不能接受再一次打击了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To stem the losses, he ordered a round of deep layoffs, which he executed with his typical empathy deficiency. As Pam Kerwin put it, he had "neither the emotional nor financial runway to be decent to people he was letting go." Jobs insisted that the firings be done immediately, with no severance pay. Kerwin took Jobs on a walk around the parking lot and begged that the employees be given at least two weeks notice. "Okay," he shot back, "but the notice is retroactive from two weeks ago." Catmull was in Moscow, and Kerwin put in frantic calls to him. When he returned, he was able to institute a meager severance plan and calm things down just a bit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了止损，乔布斯下令进行一轮大规模裁员。他缺乏对待他人的同情心，冷酷地执行了这一决定。正如帕姆·克尔温所形容的：“对于要解雇的人，他在感情和财务上都不留余地。”乔布斯坚持裁员立即开始，且不支付遣散费。克尔温拽着乔布斯在停车场周围散步，请求他至少提前两周告知员工们这一消息。“好吧，”乔布斯回答道，“但通知应该倒推回两周生效。”卡特穆尔当时在莫斯科，克尔温疯了似的跟他打电话。卡特穆尔回来后，研究出一个遣散计划，给予被解雇员工微薄的补偿，稍微平息了事态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Grove also played mentor when Jobs proposed that Pixar give Intel suggestions on how to improve the capacity of its processors to render 3 -- D graphics. When the engineers at Intel accepted the offer, Jobs sent an email back saying Pixar would need to be paid for its advice. Intel's chief engineer replied, "We have not entered into any financial arrangement in exchange for good ideas for our microprocessors in the past and have no intention for the future." Jobs forwarded the answer to Grove, saying that he found the engineer's response to be "extremely arrogant, given Intel's dismal showing in understanding computer graphics." Grove sent Jobs a blistering reply, saying that sharing ideas is "what friendly companies and friends do for each other." Grove added that he had often freely shared ideas with Jobs in the past and that Jobs should not be so mercenary. Jobs relented. "I have many faults, but one of them is not ingratitude," he responded. "Therefore, I have changed my position 180 degrees-we will freely help. Thanks for the clearer perspective."</div>

It had become for him a little island of magical artistry that gave him deep emotional pleasure, and he was willing to nurture it and bet on it. In the spring of 1988 cash was running so short that he convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. It would require close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards. Catmull took him down to the animation offices, and once Lasseter started his show-displaying his boards, doing the voices, showing his passion for his product-Jobs started to warm up.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pixar was able to create some powerful software products aimed at average consumers, or at least those average consumers who shared Jobs's passion for designing things. Jobs still hoped that the ability to make super-realistic 3 -- D images at home would become part of the desktop publishing craze. Pixar's Showplace, for example, allowed users to change the shadings on the 3 -- D objects they created so that they could display them from various angles with appropriate shadows. Jobs thought it was incredibly compelling, but most consumers were content to live without it. It was a case where his passions misled him: The software had so many amazing features that it lacked the simplicity Jobs usually demanded. Pixar couldn't compete with Adobe, which was making software that was less sophisticated but far less complicated and expensive.</div>

He told Catmull, "I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history." So Disney began talking about making a production deal with Pixar. "Lasseter's shorts were really breathtaking both in storytelling and in the use of technology," recalled Katzenberg. "I tried so hard to get him to Disney, but he was loyal to Steve and Pixar.

<div class="line_en">By this point Jobs had poured close to $50 million of his own money into Pixar-more than half of what he had pocketed when he cashed out of Apple-and he was still losing money at NeXT. He was hard-nosed about it; he forced all Pixar employees to give up their options as part of his agreement to add another round of personal funding in 1991. But he was also a romantic in his love for what artistry and technology could do together. His belief that ordinary consumers would love to do 3 -- D modeling on Pixar software turned out to be wrong, but that was soon replaced by an instinct that turned out to be right: that combining great art and digital technology would transform animated films more than anything had since 1937, when Walt Disney had given life to Snow White.</div>
