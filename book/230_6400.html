<div class="line_en">As time went by, Mr Utterson became calmer and more at peace with himself. He was truly sorry that his client, Sir Danvers Carew, was dead, but he was also very glad that Mr Hyde had disappeared. As for Doctor Jekyll, he too appeared calmer and happier. He came out into the world again. He invited friends to his house and accepted invitations to theirs. He had always been a good and generous man. Now, however, he became a churchgoer too. He was busy, he spent a lot of time in the fresh air and he looked happy and carefree. For more than two months he was at peace with himself and the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Time passed. The search for Mr Hyde continued. Sir Danvers Carew was an important and popular man and the police tried desperately to arrest the murderer and bring him to trial. But there was no sign of Mr Hyde himself, although the police and the newspapers discovered a lot about his past life. Nobody, it seemed, could say one good word about the wanted man. He was a cruel, violent man, who had lived an evil life full of hate and jealousy. None of this, however, was any help to the police. Mr Hyde had just disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间一天天过去了，搜寻海德的工作还在继续。丹佛斯·卡鲁爵士是个引人注目的重要人物，警方也竭力想抓住凶手，绳之以法。尽管警方和新闻界找出了很多海德以前的事，但还是没有他的影子。而且没有人说通缉犯的好话。他是个残酷、暴烈的人，生活在邪恶里，充满了仇恨和嫉妒。可是所有这些，没一样对警察有帮助，海德先生就那么销声匿迹了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On January 12th, however, and again on the 14th, Doctor Jekyll refused to see visitors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可到了1月12日，接着14日，杰基尔博士又拒绝会客了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Utterson called again next day, and again the day after that. After two months of almost daily meetings with his old friend, the lawyer felt rather lonely. On the sixth evening he invited his clerk, Mr Guest, to dinner with him, and on the seventh night he went to visit Doctor Lanyon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄特森先生第二天又去了，随后几天也去了。两个月以来，他几乎天天与老朋友见面，现在律师感到莫名地孤独。第六天晚上，他留助手盖斯特先生吃饭，第七天夜里，他去见了兰宁医生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Doctor Lanyon made him welcome, but Mr Utterson was shocked by the change in the doctor's appearance. His face, which was usually pink and healthy, was grey and thin, and there was a frightened look in his eyes. He was suddenly an old, sick man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰宁医生倒没有不欢迎他，但看到他的样子，厄特森先生不禁大吃一惊。他以前脸色又红润又健康，可现在却灰白而消瘦，而且他的眼睛里透着深深的惊恐，一下子变成了一个衰老、病危的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the 8th of January Mr Utterson was invited to dinner at Doctor Jekyll's house. Doctor Lanyon was there too. "This is quite like old times," thought the lawyer as he watched Doctor Jekyll smiling at Doctor Lanyon.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've had a shock, Utterson," replied Doctor Lanyon. "And it will cause my death. I have only a few weeks to live." He paused. "Well, it comes to us all sooner or later. I've had a good life, on the whole."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“厄特森，我受了次惊吓，”兰宁医生答道，“我活不长了，只是几个星期的事。”他顿了顿，又说：“唉，人终有一死，这是迟早的事，不管怎么说，我的一生还算不错。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“杰基尔也病了，”律师说，“你见过他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the name of Jekyll the look on Doctor Lanyon's face changed. "Please," he said, holding up a trembling hand, "don't speak that name in this house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一听到杰基尔的名字，兰宁医生神色大变，举起一只颤抖的手。“我求求你，”他说，“别在我这里提那个名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That doesn't surprise me, One day, Utterson, after I am dead, you will perhaps learn the full story. Meanwhile, if you can sit and talk to me of other things, please stay. Just don't mention that person, as it hurts me to think about him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也料到了。总有一天，厄特森，等我死了，你会知道事情的真相的。再有，要是愿意坐下来和我说点别的。那就请留下来，别提那个人，一想到他，我就难受。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh dear," said Mr Utterson. He hesitated for a moment. "The three of us have been friends all our lives, Lanyon. We are too old now to make new friends. Can't you forgive and forget? Perhaps I can help?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，天哪！”厄特森先生说。停了好一会儿，他又问道：“兰宁，我们三个做了一辈子朋友，我们老了，不会再有新的朋友了，你难道不能原谅和忘掉他的过失吗？也许我能帮点忙？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as he got home, Mr Utterson wrote to Doctor Jekyll. In his letter he asked why Jekyll refused to let him into his house, and why he and Doctor Lanyon were no longer friendly. The reply was long and not always easy to understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not angry with our old friend," Doctor Jekyll wrote, "but I agree with him that the two of us must never meet again. Meanwhile, you must forgive me if from now on I live a very quiet life. If you find my door closed to you, it's because I must travel this dark, dangerous road alone. I have done wrong and I'm being punished for it, and nobody can help me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不责怪咱们的老朋友，”杰基尔博士写道，“但我同意他的看法，我们不能再见面了。还有也请你原谅，从现在起我要过一种与世隔绝的生活。我的门对你关上，是因为我必须独自踏上这条危险而又黑暗的路程。我已经做了错事，并为此受到惩罚，没人能帮助我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A week later Doctor Lanyon was too ill to leave his bed. Two weeks after that he was dead. After his friend's burial, Mr Utterson went home and into his office. From his locked cupboard he took out an envelope, which he had received soon after his friend's death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一星期后，兰宁医生已经卧床不起，又过了两个星期，他就去世了。葬礼过后，厄特森先生回到家，走进自己的办公室，打开锁，从柜子里拿出一个信封，是朋友死后不久他收到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is this?" thought Mr Utterson. "Hyde has disappeared. Jekyll is his normal self again -- at least, he was until last week. Has he gone mad?" Then he remembered Doctor Lanyon's words. "There is something more," he said to himself, "something mysterious, but I have no idea what it is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是怎么回事？”厄特森先生想，“海德已经消失了，杰基尔也恢复了原来的老样子——至少上周还是这样。难道他疯了？”接着他想起了兰宁医生的话。“这里面有问题，”他自言自语道，“有哪儿不对劲，可我猜不出有什么秘密。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Doctor Lanyon's handwriting he read "G. J. Utterson. Private." The lawyer turned the envelope over and over in his hands before he opened it. What terrible news could it contain? With trembling hands Mr Utterson opened the envelope. Inside was another envelope, with the words "Not to be opened until the death or disappearance of Doctor Henry Jekyll."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是兰宁医生的笔迹，他读道：“加·约·厄特森亲启，私人密件。”律师拿着信封，在手里翻来复去地看着。里面会有什么可怕的消息呢？厄特森先生两手颤抖着拆开了信封，里面还有一个信封，写着：“到亨利·杰基尔博士死亡或失踪时方可拆阅。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lawyer could not believe his eyes. "Death or disappearance" -- the words were the same as in Doctor Jekyll's will. "I understand why Jekyll wrote those words," said Mr Utterson to himself. "But why did Lanyon write them too?" For a moment he wanted to open the envelope and uncover the mystery there and then. But Mr Utterson was too honest a man and a lawyer to do that. He knew he must obey his friend's and client's last wish. He locked the envelope away in his cupboard beside Doctor Jekyll's will.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="律师简直不敢相信自己的眼睛，“死亡或失踪时”，这个说法和杰基尔博士本人的那份遗嘱上的一模一样。“我理解为什么杰基尔会写这些话，”他自言自语道，“但为什么兰宁写得也是这样的话呢？”有那么一个瞬间，他真想拆开信，马上揭开这些秘密。但他是个非常诚实、正直的律师，不会那么做的，他一定要遵从朋友和委托人的遗愿。他又把这封信锁进柜子里，放在杰基尔博士的遗嘱旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lawyer was desperately worried about his friend Doctor Jekyll. He was afraid for him too. He called at the house but the doctor always refused to see him.</div>
