<div class="line_en">The trouble is, I've never been near an animal before. We don't have animals in the village, of course. We have to leave animals alone, so we always stay behind our village wall. In the old days people kept cats or dogs in the house; today you would go to prison for keeping an animal.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="有一只鹿正看着我，因为我在动。我试图站起来，但是非常困难。我的身体冰凉，一生中从没有这么冷过。我躺在湿漉漉的地上，他们当然没有给我衣服穿。在身体暖和起来之前，我只能慢慢地挪动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What's for breakfast, mother? Don't answer that. I don't think I can eat your food. I know how to find fruit which is good for me and to look in the ground for roots to eat; I learnt all that in the village school. Everybody learns because everybody does the Year of Sharing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上吃什么，妈妈？别回答，我想我吃不了你们的食物。我知道怎么找到对我有益的水果；我还知道怎么从地里挖树根来吃。我在村里的学校都学过。因为过“分享年”的缘故，每个人都必须学这些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mother is watching me carefully -- she thinks I'm her baby too. Poor mother! I'm a strange baby for her to have. There's another deer which looks young -- perhaps one year old. The last deer is the biggest -- I think he's the father of the two young deer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹿妈妈仔细地打量我——它以为我也是它的孩子。可怜的鹿妈妈！我是它陌生的孩子。另一只鹿看起来也不大——大概一岁的样子。最后一只鹿个子最大——我想它是两只小鹿的爸爸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="是那只个子最大的鹿，我想那是鹿爸爸，它不让我走开。它跑过来把我拱回鹿妈妈身边。真可怕，因为我身上的味道，它以为我是一只鹿宝宝。听着，鹿爸爸——我想去找东西吃！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The deer don't talk, they don't make any sounds. Well, sometimes Mother makes a little noise to Baby (and to me because I'm a "baby" too). And Baby answers with another little noise. But it's nothing special. Mother is saying, "Where are you?" and Baby is answering, "I'm here." That's all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鹿不讲话，它们不发出任何的声音。然而，有时候鹿妈妈也会对着鹿宝宝发出一点儿声响（对我也是，因为我也是“鹿宝宝”）。鹿宝宝会用另一种细弱的声音回答，没什么特别的。妈妈说：“你在哪儿？”宝宝回答：“我在这儿。”就这么简单。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Mother asked me, "Where are you?", I didn't answer at first. But she went on asking and asking and asking, and I felt sorry for her. I'm her baby, or she thinks I am. So then I answered, "I'm here," like Baby -- I tried to make the same sound as Baby. I'm sure it's right because Mother asks only once now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当鹿妈妈问我“你在哪儿？”时，一开始我没回答。但是它一次接一次不停地问，我挺可怜它的。我是它的宝宝，至少它是这么想的。所以后来我回答了：“我在这儿。”就像小鹿一样——我试着发出和鹿宝宝一样的声音。我肯定这声音没错，因为鹿妈妈现在只问一次了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Father never talks to Mother. Brother sometimes makes the noise for, "I'm here," but nobody listens.</div>

<div class="line_en">I like Baby. She's sweet. Yes, she's a girl deer. She's soft to touch, she's funny and she's always jumping up and down. She smells of milk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢鹿宝宝，它很乖。是的，它是只小母鹿。它摸起来很柔软，它也很有趣，总是跳上跳下的，闻起来有股奶味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because I have nothing to do, I play with Baby. I try to catch her. We run round and round Mother. Then she goes under Mother and I follow, which is funny because I'm nearly as big as Mother. Mother stops moving because she doesn't want to put her foot down on one of us. When I catch Baby, she suddenly jumps out of my arms. She's like a ball -- she uses her four legs to push hard and she jumps high up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我无事可做，于是和鹿宝宝一起玩。我想捉住它。我们绕着鹿妈妈跑啊跑，然后它钻到鹿妈妈肚子下面，我也跟着。这很好笑，因为我的个头和鹿妈妈差不多大。鹿妈妈停了下来，因为它不想踩到我们俩。当我捉到小鹿后，它突然从我的怀抱里跳了出去。它像一个球——用四条腿用力后蹬，然后高高跃起。">查看中文翻译</div>
