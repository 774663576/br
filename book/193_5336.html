<div class="line_en">The church had no anteroom, so the entirety of the sanctuary spread out in one gasping sweep as Langdon and Vittoria threw open the main door. The scene before them was so unexpected, so bizarre, that Langdon had to close his eyes and reopen them before his mind could take it all in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个教堂没有前厅，所以兰登和薇多利雅打开大门时，整个广大的圣所一览无遗。眼前的景象太意想不到、太怪异了，兰登得闭上双眼再睁开，才有办法接受这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The church was lavish baroque… gilded walls and altars. Dead center of the sanctuary, beneath the main cupola, wooden pews had been stacked high and were now ablaze in some sort of epic funeral pyre. A bonfire shooting high into the dome. As Langdon's eyes followed the inferno upward, the true horror of the scene descended like a bird of prey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个教堂是华丽的巴洛克风格……贴著金箔的墙面和祭坛。圣所的正中央，就在主圆顶下方，教堂的木头靠背长椅堆得高高的，现在正著了火，成了某种大型的火葬柴堆。一堆直衝向圆顶的营火。兰登的双眼随著这幅地狱景象往上看，彻骨的悚然像隻猛禽飞扑下来攫住了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">High overhead, from the left and right sides of the ceiling, hung two incensor cables -- lines used for swinging frankincense vessels above the congregation. These lines, however, carried no incensors now. Nor were they swinging. They had been used for something else…</div>

<div class="line_en">As if ignited by some unseen force, Langdon felt his body suddenly in motion, dashing down the main aisle toward the conflagration. His lungs filled with smoke as he closed in. Ten feet from the inferno, at a full sprint, Langdon hit a wall of heat. The skin on his face singed, and he fell back, shielding his eyes and landing hard on the marble floor. Staggering upright, he pressed forward again, hands raised in protection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好像被某种无形的力量所驱动般，兰登不自觉地开始行动，朝大火所在的主祭坛衝去。随著愈来愈靠近，他的肺充满了烟。兰登全力衝刺，离那片地狱景象十迟之时，他忽然撞上了一道热气形成的厚墙。他脸上的细毛被烧焦了，不禁后退，遮著眼睛重重摔倒在大理石地板上。他挣扎著起身，又硬往前走，双手举起来保护自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon felt paralyzed as he stared upward. A moment later, he witnessed the final abomination. The old man was alive, and he raised his head. A pair of terrified eyes gazed down in a silent plea for help. On the man's chest was a scorched emblem. He had been branded. Langdon could not see it clearly, but he had little doubt what the marking said. As the flames climbed higher, lapping at the man's feet, the victim let out a cry of pain, his body trembling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登往上看著，觉得整个人瘫掉了。过了一会儿，他又亲眼目睹了最骇人的景象。那个老人还活著，抬起了头。他恐怖的双眼往下凝视，无言地恳求帮助。老人的胸膛有个烧焦的符号。他被烙印了。兰登看不清楚，但他毫不怀疑上面烙印的是什麽符号。火焰升得愈来愈高，烧上了老人的双脚，他痛苦地大喊，全身颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suspended from the cables was a human being. A naked man. Each wrist had been connected to an opposing cable, and he had been hoisted almost to the point of being torn apart. His arms were outstretched in a spread-eagle as if he were nailed to some sort of invisible crucifix hovering within the house of God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从缆线上悬挂下来的，是一个人。一个裸身男人。双手手腕各自繫在反方向的两条缆线上，被紧紧吊起到几乎要被撕开的程度。他的双臂往外张开，成大鹰展翅的姿势，好像是被钉在这个天主寓所内上方的某个无形十字架上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">High above, smoke and flames swirled in the cupola. The incensor cables stretched outward from the man's wrists, rising to the ceiling where they passed through pulleys, and descended again to metal cleats on either side of the church. Langdon looked over at one of the cleats. It was high on the wall, but he knew if he could get to it and loosen one of the lines, the tension would slacken and the man would swing wide of the fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教堂上方，烟和火焰成漩涡状衝向圆顶。薰香缆线从老人的两个手腕往外延伸，到了天花板上穿过两个滑轮，又往下连到教堂左右两方墙壁的金属栓上。兰登仔细看著其中一个栓子，位于墙上很高的地方，但他知道如果他能搆著，把其中一条缆线鬆开，紧绷的张力会减轻，上头悬吊著的人就会被甩开，远离火堆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moving back again, he scanned the chapel walls. A heavy tapestry, he thought. If I can somehow smother the… But he knew a tapestry was not to be found. This is a baroque chapel, Robert, not some damn German castle! Think! He forced his eyes back to the suspended man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他往后退，扫视著教堂的墙面。一面沉重的挂毯，他心想，我就可以闷熄那堆火……但他知道找不到挂毯。这是个巴洛克风格的教堂，罗柏，可不是什麽德国城堡！快想！他又勉强把眼光掉转，回到那个悬吊的老人身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the rear of the church, Vittoria clutched the back of a pew, trying to gather her senses. The image overhead was horrid. She forced her eyes away. Do something! She wondered where Olivetti was. Had he seen the Hassassin? Had he caught him? Where were they now? Vittoria moved forward to help Langdon, but as she did, a sound stopped her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教堂后方，薇多利雅抓著一排靠背长椅的椅背，试图兜拢思绪。上方的那幅景象太可怕了。她逼自己不要去看。想想办法！她搞不懂欧里维提跑去哪裡了。他见到那个哈撒辛了吗？抓到他了吗？他们现在人在哪裡？薇多利雅往前走，想去帮兰登，但才刚举步，一个声音让她停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一道火焰发出爆裂声，猛然窜高，兰登听到上方传来一个尖厉的嘶吼声。老人双脚的皮肤开始起水泡了，那位枢机主教正被活活炙烤。兰登双眼盯住那个金属栓，然后跑过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As she approached the end of the aisle, she sensed the sound was coming from the floor just around the corner at the end of the pews. As she moved forward, gun outstretched in her right hand, she realized she was also holding something in her left hand -- her cell phone. In her panic she had forgotten that outside she had used it to dial the commander… setting off his phone's silent vibration feature as a warning. Vittoria raised her phone to her ear. It was still ringing. The commander had never answered. Suddenly, with rising fear, Vittoria sensed she knew what was making the sound. She stepped forward, trembling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走向走道的尾端时，感觉到声音来自那排靠背长椅末端角落的地板上。她继续往前走，右手持枪往前伸，这才发现自己的左手也抓著东西──她的手机。她刚刚一时紧张，都忘了自己曾在教堂外用手机打电话给指挥官……欧里维提为了警戒，把他手机的响铃关掉，改为震动。指挥官始终没接电话。突然间，薇多利雅害怕起来，觉得她知道那个声音的来源了。她往前走，颤抖著。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The entire church seemed to sink beneath her feet as her eyes met the lifeless form on the floor. No stream of liquid flowed from the body. No signs of violence tattooed the flesh. There was only the fearful geometry of the commander's head… torqued backward, twisted 180 degrees in the wrong direction. Vittoria fought the images of her own father's mangled body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的双眼看到地板上那个毫无生气的形体时，脚下的教堂好像往下沉。他的身上没有血流出来，皮肤上也没有暴力的痕迹。只有头部那个可怕的结构……往后硬扭，反方向翻转了一百八十度。薇多利雅脑中浮现出她父亲被糟蹋的尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crackling of the flames was getting louder by the instant, but a second sound also cut the air. A metallic vibration. Nearby. The repetitive pulse seemed to emanate from the end of the pews to her left. It was a stark rattle, like the ringing of a phone, but stony and hard. She clutched the gun firmly and moved down the row of pews. The sound grew louder. On. Off. A recurrent vibration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时火焰的劈啪声更大了，但又出现了另一个声音。一个金属的震动声。很近。反覆的律动似乎来自她左边那排靠背长椅的末端。那是一种僵硬的嘎嘎声，像电话铃响，只不过声音沉闷而冰冷。她牢牢抓住手枪，沿著那排靠背长椅往前走。那个声音愈来愈大，响起又消失。是一种週期性的震动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She started to spin, gun raised, but she knew she was too late. A laser beam of heat screamed from the top of her skull to the soles of her feet as the killer's elbow crashed down on the back of her neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想转身，举起枪，但心知已经太迟。那个杀手的手肘朝她后颈猛撞下来，一股雷射光束般的热辣剧痛从头壳顶部直透脚掌心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The phone on the commander's belt lay against the floor, vibrating over and over against the cold marble. Vittoria hung up her own phone, and the ringing stopped. In the silence, Vittoria heard a new sound. A breathing in the dark directly behind her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="指挥官皮带上的电话躺在地板上，抵著冷冷的大理石一遍遍震动著。薇多利雅按掉自己的电话，铃声停止了。一片静寂中，薇多利雅听到了一个新的声音。就在她背后黑暗中传来的呼吸声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Across the sanctuary, on the left lateral wall, Langdon balanced atop a pew and scraped upward on the wall trying to reach the cleat. The cable was still six feet above his head. Cleats like these were common in churches and were placed high to prevent tampering. Langdon knew priests used wooden ladders calledpiuò li to access the cleats. The killer had obviously used the church's ladder to hoist his victim. So where the hell is the ladder now! Langdon looked down, searching the floor around him. He had a faint recollection of seeing a ladder in here somewhere. But where? A moment later his heart sank. He realized where he had seen it. He turned toward the raging fire. Sure enough, the ladder was high atop the blaze, engulfed in flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在教堂的另一头，左侧的墙边，兰登颤危危地站在一排靠背长椅顶端，往上抓著墙面，想搆到那个栓子。那条缆线仍悬在他头上六迟之处。这类栓子在教堂中很常见，通常都位于高处，以防有人乱动。兰登知道神父们会用一种叫做piuoli的梯子去调整栓子。杀手显然是用教堂的梯子吊起他的受害人。所以那把梯子现在跑哪儿去了！兰登往下看，搜寻著四周的地板。他模糊记得在教堂哪裡看到过一把梯子。可是在哪裡？片刻之后，他的心往下沉，明白自己是在哪裡看到过了。他目光转向那堆熊熊烈火。的确没错，那把梯子就位于烈焰顶端，正被大火吞噬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Filled now with desperation, Langdon scanned the entire church from his raised platform, looking for anything at all that could help him reach the cleat. As his eyes probed the church, he had a sudden realization.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a howl of pain from above, and Langdon sensed he was already too late. As his eyes went skyward again and saw the slowly roasting victim, Langdon had thoughts for only one thing. Water. Lots of it. Put out the fire. At least lower the flames. "I need water, damn it!" he yelled out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上方传来一阵痛苦的号叫，兰登知道自己太迟了。他的双眼再度往上，看到那个正被慢慢炙烤的受害者，此时兰登只想到一样东西。水，很多水。把火扑灭，至少让火小一点。「我需要水，该死！」他大声喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">High above the chapel floor, Cardinal Guidera endured his last torturous moments of consciousness. As he looked down the length of his naked body, he saw the skin on his legs begin to blister and peel away. I am in hell, he decided. God, why hast thou forsaken me? He knew this must be hell because he was looking at the brand on his chest upside down… and yet, as if by the devil's magic, the word made perfect sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在教堂上方高处，基德拉枢机主教忍受著他失去意识前的最后一刻折磨。他往下看著自己赤裸的身体，看到了双腿的皮肤开始起水泡、剥落。我在地狱，他判定。主啊，你为何抛弃我？他知道这一定是地狱，因为他上下颠倒看著胸膛上的烙印……然而，就像是恶魔的魔法般，那个字却完全合理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sudden wave of panic that rose in Langdon was a frenzy of disjunct fears. His initial instinct was for Vittoria. What had this animal done to her? Was she hurt? Orworse? In the same instant, Langdon realized the man overhead was screaming louder. The cardinal would die. Helping him now was impossible. Then, as the Hassassin leveled the gun at Langdon's chest, Langdon's panic turned inward, his senses on overload. He reacted on instinct as the shot went off. Launching off the bench, Langdon sailed arms first over the sea of church pews.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登胸中涌起了另一股恐慌。他第一个直觉是想到薇多利雅。这个禽兽把她怎麽了？她受伤了吗？或更糟？正当此时，兰登才意识到头上的那个老人嘶吼得更大声了。枢机主教会死。现在不可能帮他了。然后，当哈撒辛举起枪，对准兰登的胸膛时，兰登的恐慌转向自己，他的意识已经超过负荷。枪声响起时，他凭著直觉反应。他从椅背上往下跳，双臂朝下，扑向那一大片教堂靠背长椅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he hit the pews, he hit harder than he had imagined, immediately rolling to the floor. The marble cushioned his fall with all the grace of cold steel. Footsteps closed to his right. Langdon turned his body toward the front of the church and began scrambling for his life beneath the pews.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他撞上那些靠背长椅，撞得比他想像的要重，随即翻滚到地板上。身子底下的大理石冰冷如钢。脚步声从他右边靠近，兰登转身朝教堂前方，开始在教堂长椅底下拼命往前爬。">查看中文翻译</div>
