<div class="line_en">When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, her total outfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitation alligator-skin satchel, a small lunch in a paper box, and a yellow leather snap purse, containing her ticket, a scrap of paper with her sister's address in Van Buren Street, and four dollars in money. It was in August, 1889. She was eighteen years of age, bright, timid, and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth. Whatever touch of regret at parting characterised her thoughts, it was certainly not for advantages now being given up. A gush of tears at her mother's farewell kiss, a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour mill where her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the familiar green environs of the village passed in review, and the threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were irretrievably broken.</div>

<div class="line_en">To be sure there was always the next station, where one might descend and return. There was the great city, bound more closely by these very trains which came up daily. Columbia City was not so very far away, even once she was in Chicago. What, pray, is a few hours -- a few hundred miles? She looked at the little slip bearing her sister's address and wondered. She gazed at the green landscape, now passing in swift review, until her swifter thoughts replaced its impression with vague conjectures of what Chicago might be.</div>

<div class="line_en">When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things. Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse. Of an intermediate balance, under the circumstances, there is no possibility. The city has its cunning wiles, no less than the infinitely smaller and more human tempter. There are large forces which allure with all the soulfulness of expression possible in the most cultured human. The gleam of a thousand lights is often as effective as the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye. Half the undoing of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplished by forces wholly superhuman. A blare of sound, a roar of life, a vast array of human hives, appeal to the astonished senses in equivocal terms. Without a counsellor at hand to whisper cautious interpretations, what falsehoods may not these things breathe into the unguarded ear! Unrecognised for what they are, their beauty, like music, too often relaxes, then weakens, then perverts the simpler human perceptions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个18岁的女孩离家出走，结局不外两种。也许她会遇到好人相助，变得更好；也许她会很快接受大都市的道德标准，而变坏了——二者必具其一。在这种情况下，要想不好不坏，保持中不溜的状态，是根本做不到的。大城市具有自身种种诱人的花招，并不亚于那些教人学坏的男男女女，当然人比社会微小得多，也更富于人情味。社会具有巨大的影响力，能像最老于世故的人才可能想到的甜言蜜语一样乱人情怀。都市的万点灯火比起情人脉脉含情的迷人眼神来，那魅力是不差分毫的呢。可以说，有一半涉世未深的纯洁心灵是被非人为的影响力带坏的。城市里喧闹的人声和热闹的生活，加上鳞次栉比的楼房建筑，在令人惊愕的同时，又令人怦然心动，教给人们模棱两可的生活意义。这种时候，如果没有人在她们身边轻声告诫和解说，又有什么谎言和谬误不会灌入这些不加提防的耳朵里去呢？头脑简单的年轻人看不清生活中的那些虚假外表，而为它们的美所倾倒，就像音乐一样，它们先令人陶醉松弛，继而令人意志薄弱，最后诱人走上岐路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caroline, or Sister Carrie, as she had been half affectionately termed by the family, was possessed of a mind rudimentary in its power of observation and analysis. Self-interest with her was high, but not strong. It was, nevertheless, her guiding characteristic. Warm with the fancies of youth, pretty with the insipid prettiness of the formative period, possessed of a figure promising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certain native intelligence, she was a fair example of the middle American class -- two generations removed from the emigrant. Books were beyond her interest -- knowledge a sealed book. In the intuitive graces she was still crude. She could scarcely toss her head gracefully. Her hands were almost ineffectual. The feet, though small, were set flatly. And yet she was interested in her charms, quick to understand the keener pleasures of life, ambitious to gain in material things. A half-equipped little knight she was, venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off supremacy, which should make it prey and subject -- the proper penitent, grovelling at a woman's slipper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉洛林在家时，家里人带着几分疼她已具有初步的观察力和分析能力。她有利己心，不过不很强烈，这是她的主要特点。她充满着年轻人的热烈幻想。虽然漂亮，她还只是一个正在发育阶段的美人胎子。不过从她的身段已经可以看出将来发育成熟时的美妙体态了。她的眼睛里透着天生的聪明。她是一个典型的美国中产阶级少女——她们家已是移民的第三代了。她对书本不感兴趣，书本知识和她无缘。她还不太懂如何举手投足，显示本能的优雅举止。她扬起头的姿态还不够优美。她的手也几乎没有用。她的脚虽然长得小巧，却只会频频地放在地上。然而她对于自己的魅力已极感兴趣，对生活的更强烈的乐趣感知很快，并渴望获得种种物质的享受。她还只是一个装备不全的小骑士，正冒险出发去侦察神秘的大城市，梦想着某个遥远的将来她将征服这新世界，让那大城市俯首称臣，诚惶诚恐，跪倒在她的脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The train was just pulling out of Waukesha. For some time she had been conscious of a man behind. She felt him observing her mass of hair. He had been fidgetting, and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter. Her maidenly reserve, and a certain sense of what was conventional under the circumstances, called her to forestall and deny this familiarity, but the daring and magnetism of the individual, born of past experiences and triumphs, prevailed. She answered. He leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded to make himself volubly agreeable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here was a type of the travelling canvasser for a manufacturing house -- a class which at that time was first being dubbed by the slang of the day "drummers." He came within the meaning of a still newer term, which had sprung into general use among Americans in 1880, and which concisely expressed the thought of one whose dress or manners are calculated to elicit the admiration of susceptible young women -- a "masher." His suit was of a striped and crossed pattern of brown wool, new at that time, but since become familiar as a business suit. The low crotch of the vest revealed a stiff shirt bosom of white and pink stripes. From his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the same pattern, fastened with large, gold plate buttons, set with the common yellow agates known as "cat's-eyes." His fingers bore several rings -- one, the ever-enduring heavy seal -- and from his vest dangled a neat gold watch chain, from which was suspended the secret insignia of the Order of Elks. The whole suit was rather tight-fitting, and was finished off with heavy-soled tan shoes, highly polished, and the grey fedora hat. He was, for the order of intellect represented, attractive, and whatever he had to recommend him, you may be sure was not lost upon Carrie, in this, her first glance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lest this order of individual should permanently pass, let me put down some of the most striking characteristics of his most successful manner and method. Good clothes, of course, were the first essential, the things without which he was nothing. A strong physical nature, actuated by a keen desire for the feminine, was the next. A mind free of any consideration of the problems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed, but an insatiable love of variable pleasure. His method was always simple. Its principal element was daring, backed, of course, by an intense desire and admiration for the sex. Let him meet with a young woman once and he would approach her with an air of kindly familiarity, not unmixed with pleading, which would result in most cases in a tolerant acceptance. If she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie, or if she "took up" with him at all, to call her by her first name. If he visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions. In more exclusive circles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went slower. If some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention -- to pass the compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlor car, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination. Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered; all these figured in the things which he could do. If, when she reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her, it was because, in his own estimation, he had signally failed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我要记下一些这类人成功的举止和方法中最显著的特点，以防他们永久消失了。当然，服饰漂亮是第一要素，要是没有了服饰这类东西，他就算不得什么人物了。第二要素是身强力壮，性欲旺盛。他天性无忧无虑，既不费心去考虑任何问题，也不去管世间的种种势力或影响，支配他的生活动力不是对财富的贪婪，而是对声色之乐的贪得无厌。他的方法一贯很简单，主要是胆大，当然是出于对异性的渴望和仰慕。年轻姑娘只要让他见上一面，他就会用一种温和熟识的态度去套热乎，语其中带有几分恳求，结果那些姑娘往往宽容接纳了他。如果那女子露出点卖弄风情的品性，他就会上前去帮她理理领带。如果她“吃”他那一套献殷勤的手段，他马上开始用小名称呼她了。他上百货大楼时，总喜欢靠在柜台上和女店员像老熟人一样聊聊，问些套近乎的问题。如果是在人少的场合，譬如在火车上或者候车室，他追人的速度要放慢一些。如果他发现一个看来可以下手的对象，他就使出浑身的解数来——打招呼问好，带路去客厅车厢，帮助拎手提箱。如果拎不成箱子，那就在她旁边找个位子坐下来，满心希望在到达目的地以前可以向她献献殷勤：拿枕头啦，送书啦，摆脚凳啦，放遮帘啦。他能做的主要就是这一些。如果她到了目的地，他却没有下车帮她照看行李，那是因为照他估计他的追求显然失败了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes. No matter how young, it is one of the things she wholly comprehends. There is an indescribably faint line in the matter of man's apparel which somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who are not. Once an individual has passed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glance from her. There is another line at which the dress of a man will cause her to study her own. This line the individual at her elbow now marked for Carrie. She became conscious of an inequality. Her own plain blue dress, with its black cotton tape trimmings, now seemed to her shabby. She felt the worn state of her shoes.</div>

Such a purse had never been carried by any one attentive to her. Indeed, an experienced traveller, a brisk man of the world, had never come within such close range before. The purse, the shiny tan shoes, the smart new suit, and the air with which he did things, built up for her a dim world of fortune, of which he was the centre.

<div class="line_cn" title="他伸手到后面的裤袋里掏出一个厚厚的皮夹，里面装着些单据，旅行里程记录本和一卷钞票。这给她留下了深刻的印象：以前向她献殷勤的男人中没有一个掏得出这么一个皮夹。真的，她还从来没有和一个跑过大码头，见过大世面，见多识广性格活跃的人打过交道。他的皮夹子，发光的皮鞋，漂亮的新西装，和他行事那种气派，这一切为她隐隐约约地描绘出一个以他为中心的花花世界。她不由得对他想做的一切抱着好感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett, Caryoe &amp; Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H. Drouet.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at it while he put up his purse. Then he got out a letter from a bunch in his coat pocket. "This is the house I travel for," he went on, pointing to a picture on it, "corner of State and Lake." There was pride in his voice. He felt that it was something to be connected with such a place, and he made her feel that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把皮夹收起来时，她的目光还盯着手上的名片。然后他从外套口袋掏出一札信，从中抽出一封来。“这是那家我为他们推销货物的商号，”他一边说一边指着信封上的图片。“在斯台特街和湖滨大道的转弯处。”他的声音里流露出自豪。他感到跟这样一个地方有联系是很了不起的，他让她也有了这种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How true it is that words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we mean. Little audible links, they are, chaining together great inaudible feelings and purposes. Here were these two, bandying little phrases, drawing purses, looking at cards, and both unconscious of how inarticulate all their real feelings were. Neither was wise enough to be sure of the working of the mind of the other. He could not tell how his luring succeeded. She could not realise that she was drifting, until he secured her address. Now she felt that she had yielded something -- he, that he had gained a victory. Already they felt that they were somehow associated. Already he took control in directing the conversation. His words were easy. Her manner was relaxed.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were nearing Chicago. Signs were everywhere numerous. Trains flashed by them. Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great city. Far away were indications of suburban towns, some big smokestacks towering high in the air.</div>

Particularly if it be evening -- that mystic period between the glare and gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another. Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the weary! What old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the soul of the toiler to itself, "I shall soon be free. I shall be in the ways and the hosts of the merry. The streets, the lamps, the lighted chamber set for dining, are for me. The theatre, the halls, the parties, the ways of rest and the paths of song -- these are mine in the night." Though all humanity be still enclosed in the shops, the thrill runs abroad. It is in the air. The dullest feel something which they may not always express or describe. It is the lifting of the burden of toil.</div>

"This is the Chicago River," and he pointed to a little muddy creek, crowded with the huge masted wanderers from far-off waters nosing the black-posted banks.
