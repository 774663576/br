<div class="line_en">Suppose you should be walking down Broadway after dinner, with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville. Suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm. You turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman, wonderful in diamonds and Russian sables. She thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll, flashes out a tiny pair of scissors, snips off the second button of your overcoat, meaningly ejaculates the one word, "parallelogram!" and swiftly flies down a cross street, looking back fearfully over her shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the big city the twin spirits Romance and Adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers. As we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises. Without knowing why, we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits; in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house; instead of at our familiar curb, a cab-driver deposits us before a strange door, which one, with a smile, opens for us and bids us enter; a slip of paper, written upon, flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of Chance; we exchange glances of instantaneous hate, affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds; a sudden douse of rain -- and our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the Full Moon and first cousin of the Sidereal System; at every corner handkerchiefs drop, fingers beckon, eyes besiege, and the lost, the lonely, the rapturous, the mysterious, the perilous, changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers. But few of us are willing to hold and follow them. We are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs. We pass on; and some day we come, at the end of a very dull life, to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two, a satin rosette kept in a safe-deposit drawer, and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个大城市里，罗曼史和冒险这一对孪生姐妹的精神总是无处不在，寻觅真正的追随者。我们徜徉街头之时，她们狡猾地乔装打扮，一次又一次地改头换面，偷窥我们，使激将法激我们。我们常常莫明其妙地倏地抬眼，但见一扇窗内有一张脸，那脸仿佛一极熟的朋友，在一条酣酣沉睡的通衢大道上，我们听见一间空荡荡紧闭窗板的房子里传出痛苦和忧惧的叫声。出租马车的车夫没有在我们熟悉的路边停车，而是把我们像下蛋一般下在古怪的门前，门前立着一个人，面带微笑为我们开门，示意我们入内。一张写有字的纸片从圣坛上高高的花格飘落而下。我们和大街上熙熙攘攘的匆匆过客彼此匆匆对视一眼，交换着彼此的厌恶，柔情与忧惧；一阵兜头而来的大雨——我们的伞也许可以为月神的女儿和恒星年历的大表妹遮风挡雨；在每条街的拐角，手绢儿飘然而下，纤纤玉指在向我们召唤，一双双眼睛将我们团团罩住，于是乎，冒险家的那种失落，孤寂、狂喜、神秘、充满危险的千变万化的诱饵便神不知鬼不觉地洒到我们周围。然而我们感觉我们中间很少有人愿意吃饵。我们感觉到习风旧俗像一根通条从背上直插向下，我们浑身僵直，通身麻木。我们继续我们的平淡无奇的人生旅程；将来有一天，当一种乏味的人生行将结束之际，我们开始反省，原来我们一生的罗曼史苍白惨淡，充其量不过是一、二个婚姻、一枚存放在保险库中保险匣内的锦缎玫瑰花饰，一生一世与蒸汽取暖炉的不停的呕气争斗而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half-adventurers -- brave and splendid figures -- have been numerous. From the Crusades to the Palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction. But each of them had a prize to win, a goal to kick, an axe to grind, a race to run, a new thrust in tierce to deliver, a name to carve, a crow to pick -- so they were not followers of true adventure.</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening Rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city. Two streams of people filled the sidewalks -- the home-hurrying, and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousand-candle-power table d'hote.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天傍晚，鲁道夫在位于老城区的市中心一条横穿城区的大街上蹓跶。两旁人行道上挤满两排人流——匆匆忙忙回家的人和那一队心慌意乱的有家不归而去赴华而不实的一千支烛光照明的公司客饭的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rudolf Steiner was a true adventurer. Few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious. The most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner. Sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths. Twice he had spent the night in a station-house; again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters; his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement. But with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁道夫·斯坦纳算得上一个真正的冒险家。他的一间斗室在过道旁，他很少不在傍晚时分离开斗室，跑出去寻找刺激，寻找稀奇古怿的事情。在他看来，人生一世，最有趣的莫过于近在咫尺，出门就碰上的怪事。他心甘情愿地去冒险，结果有时候弄得他误入歧途。他两次在一个车站过夜；他儿次三番地给头脑简单而又贪财的骗子骗得不辨东西；别人一阵恭维，拍得他忘乎所以，结果是手表和钱被洗劫一空。然而他依然故我，痴心不改，但凡有诱惑，他都欣然前往，继续他快乐的冒险人生旅程。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to Rudolf.

<div class="line_en">During his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention (with a qualm), to a restaurant before which it was set; but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentist's sign high above the next door. A giant negro, fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat, yellow trousers and a military cap, discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走道的时候，便道上的一只玻璃柜里有一副牙齿，牙齿激烈地打战，一开始似乎把他的注意力吸引到（伴随着一阵恶心）一家餐馆，因为玻璃柜就放在餐馆前面；可是再一细瞧，才发现隔壁高悬着牙医诊所的灯饰招牌。一个巨人般的黑人，花里胡哨地套一件红色大衣，上有手工绣品，下身着一条黄色裤子，头戴一顶军帽，谨慎地向过往行人中愿意接受他赠品的人散发宣传卡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently. Surprised, he turned it over and looked again with interest. One side of the card was blank; on the other was written in ink three words, "The Green Door." And then Rudolf saw, three steps in front of him, a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed. Rudolf picked it up. It was printed with the dentist's name and address and the usual schedule of "plate work" and "bridge work" and specious promises of "painless" operations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向前又走了几码，漫不经心地瞥一眼手中的卡片。他心头不由一惊，翻过卡片，绕有兴趣地定睛细观。宣传品的一面是空白；另一面用墨水笔手书“绿门”二字。接着，鲁道夫瞧见前边三步远一个男人把黑人递给他的卡随手扔掉。鲁道夫拾起卡片，上面印着牙医的姓名、地址，以及常见的那种何时“镶假牙”，何时“做齿桥”和“镶齿冠”的时间表，还有华而不实的“无痛”手术的允诺等等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered. Then he crossed the street, walked down a block, recrossed and joined the upward current of people again. Without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time, he carelessly took the card that was handed him. Ten steps away he inspected it. In the same handwriting that appeared on the first card "The Green Door" was inscribed upon it. Three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him. These fell blank side up. Rudolf turned them over. Every one bore the printed legend of the dental "parlours."</div>

<div class="line_en">Rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth. This time as he passed he received no card. In spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb, the Ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood, offering the cards suavely to some, allowing others to pass unmolested. Every half minute he chanted a harsh, unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera. And not only did he withhold a card this time, but it seemed to Rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold, almost contemptuous disdain.</div>

<div class="line_en">The look stung the adventurer. He read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting.

<div class="line_en">The first floor, now closed, seemed to house millinery or furs. The second floor, by the winking electric letters, was the dentist's.

Still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity.</div>

<div class="line_en">After concluding his survey Rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house. Up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued; and at its top paused. The hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas one -- far to his right, the other nearer, to his left. He looked toward the nearer light and saw, within its wan halo, a green door. For one moment he hesitated; then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the African juggler of cards; and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl lay still, as if in a faint. Rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel. People must be rolled upon a barrel who -- no, no; that was for drowned persons. He began to fan her with his hat. That was successful, for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes. And then the young man saw that hers, indeed, was the one missing face from his heart's gallery of intimate portraits. The frank, grey eyes, the little nose, turning pertly outward; the chestnut hair, curling like the tendrils of a pea vine, seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures. But the face was wofully thin and pale.</div>

<div class="line_en">A faint rustle was heard inside, and the door slowly opened. A girl not yet twenty stood there, white-faced and tottering. She loosed the knob and swayed weakly, groping with one hand. Rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall. He closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet. Neat, but extreme poverty was the story that he read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里面传来轻微的声音，门缓缓打开。一位芳龄不到二十岁的少女站在门口，白白的脸蛋儿，脚步蹒跚。她松开门扣，身子虚弱地摇晃着，一只手摸索着。鲁道夫抓住她，扶她到靠墙的一个旧沙发上躺下。他关上门，借着摇曳的煤汽灯光麻利地把屋子前后左右打量了一番。整洁，却一贫如洗，便是他对屋子的印象。">查看中文翻译</div>

He took it from her, laughingly, and poured the cup full of milk. "Drink that first" he ordered, "and then you shall have some tea, and then a chicken wing.

<div class="line_en">He drew up the other chair. The tea brightened the girl's eyes and brought back some of her colour. She began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal. She seemcd to regard the young man's presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thing -- not as though she undervalued the conventions; but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human. But gradually, with the return of strength and comfort, came also a sense of the little conventions that belong; and she began to tell him her little story. It was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every day -- the shop girl's story of insufficient wages, further reduced by "fines" that go to swell the store's profits; of time lost through illness; and then of lost positions, lost hope, and -- the knock of the adventurer upon the green door.</div>
