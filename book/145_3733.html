<div class="line_en">'Two liang of sea-flavour noodles, one liang of Dan Dan noodles,' I replied, dumping my schoolbag on the ground and perching on an unsteady stool, just inches from the stream of passing bicycles. There was no need to look at the blackboard, chalked up with the names of a dozen or so noodle dishes, because I knew it by heart, having eaten at Xie Laoban's almost every day since I had arrived in Chengdu. Xie Laoban yelled my order out to his staff of three or four young blokes, who were scurrying around inside the noodle shop behind the coal-burning stove. A glass cabinet held bowls of seasonings: darkly fragrant chilli oil, ground roasted Sichuan pepper, sliced green onions, soy sauce and vinegar, salt and pepper. Nearby, potfuls of stocks and stews simmered away on an electric cooker, and skeins of freshly made noodles lay snakily in deep trays of woven bamboo. At the front of the shop, in full view of the street, steam drifted up from two enormous wokfuls of boiling water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Resuming his conversation, Xie Laoban slumped back in his bamboo chair, smoking a cigarette as he recounted some grimly amusing tale. There was always an embittered look about his face, an edge of hostility and suspicion, and if he smiled at his acquaintances, his smile was tinged with a sneer of sarcasm. In his forties, he had a face pitted with the legacy of acne, sun-darkened yet wan and drawn. He seemed world-weary and cynical, though my foreign student friends and I never knew why. He fascinated us, but while we speculated incessantly about his life, wondering where he lived and with whom, what he did in the evenings, and whether he had ever been happy, in the end it was hard to imagine Xie Laoban being anywhere else but in that bamboo chair in the backstreets around the university, taking orders for noodles and barking at his staff. The bolder among us -- Sasha and Pasha from Vladivostock, Parisian Davide -- greeted him heartily, trying to engage him in conversation or cracking jokes in a vain attempt to raise the glimmer of a smile. But he remained stony-faced and deadpan, simply asking, as he always did, 'Sa zi mian?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢老板继续和客人聊天，舒服地躺在竹椅上，一边抽烟一边说着诡异又有趣的故事。他脸上总有一种阴郁不悦的表情，仿佛总是带着敌意和怀疑。就算是向熟人微笑，那笑容里也有一种冷冷的嘲讽。这个男人四十几岁了，脸上全是从前出粉刺留下的坑坑洼洼，肤色被太阳晒得深深浅浅，有一种病态。老板的面相是有点厌世、有点愤世嫉俗的，不过我和留学生朋友们对个中原因也不得而知。他的气质深深吸引了我们。我们一直试图去勾勒他的生活，想象他在哪里住、和谁住、晚上干些什么、有没有快乐幸福过。但不管我们怎么想，最后也很难想象谢老板不在学校后街这把竹椅子上、不问你吃啥子面、不朝伙计大吼大叫。我们中间有几个胆子比较大的，比如从海参崴来的萨沙和帕夏，还有巴黎来的戴维德，会热情地跟他打招呼，想跟他聊聊天，或者讲个笑话，一心想让他笑一笑。但他还是一张冰块脸，完全面无表情、不动声色，只是和往常一样问道：“啥子面？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could see the young men assembling my lunch, trickling spices and oils into the tiny bowl for my Dan Dan noodles, sprinkling a little salt and pepper into the larger bowl for the sea-flavour noodles. The appropriate weight of noodles (one liang is about fifty grammes) were flung into the wok to cook, and before long steaming bowls were brought to my table. The sea-flavour noodles were, as always, richly comforting in their seafood broth, with a topping of stewed pork and bamboo shoots, mushrooms, dried shrimps and mussels. And the Dan Dan noodles -- well, they were undoubtedly the best in town, the best anyone had ever tasted. They looked quite plain: a small bowlful of noodles topped with a spoonful of dark, crisp minced beef. But as soon as you stirred them with your chopsticks, you awakened the flavours in the slick of spicy seasonings at the base of the bowl, and coated each strand of pasta in a mix of soy sauce, chilli oil, sesame paste and Sichuan pepper. The effect was electrifying. Within seconds, your mouth was on fire, your lips quivering under the onslaught of the pepper, and your whole body radiant with heat. (On a warm day, you might even break out into a sweat.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着年轻的伙计们做着我的午饭，把辣子和各种各样的调料倒进我那小小的一碗担担面里，再往那碗大一点的海味面里加点盐和胡椒。他们准确地抓起一两或二两面，扔进锅里煮。不一会儿，热气腾腾的两碗面就端到我桌上。海味面和以往一样，浸在浓郁的海鲜汤里，有种安慰人心的感觉，上面还加了炖好的肉、笋、蘑菇，再加点干虾米和淡菜。担担面呢，嗯，毫无疑问这是成都最好吃的担担面，走遍天下恐怕也就是这一家了。它看上去倒是其貌不扬：一小碗面，加了一勺深色的、松脆的牛肉碎。但只要你拿起筷子，把面拌一拌，就会唤醒铺在碗底的那些香料。每一根面条都会裹上酱油、红油、芝麻酱和花椒混合成的调料，效果实在是石破天惊。入口短短几秒，你的嘴巴就会着火，你的双唇会在花椒的猛攻下不停颤抖，你的全身都会散发着热气（天气热的时候就会汗流浃背了）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Xie Laoban's Dan Dan noodles were a potent pick-me-up, a cure for hangover or heartache, and the perfect antidote to the grey humidity of the Chengdu climate. As students, we were slavishly addicted to them. Many, like me, ordered a gentler meal of soup noodles with fried egg and tomatoes or sea-flavour stew, with a small shot of fiery Dan Dan noodles as a chaser, while the fast-living, hard-drinking Russians and Poles invariably ordered a full three liang of 'dan danr'. We devoured them at one of the wobbly tables in the street, brushed by bicycles, assaulted by the honk of taxis and their sour aftermath of exhaust fumes. When we had finished, we asked Xie Laoban for the bill, and he would add up the paltry sums, take our crumpled notes, and rootle around in the little half-open wooden drawer for some change.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dan Dan noodles are the archetypal Chengdu street snack. Their name comes from the bamboo shoulderpole that street vendors traditionally use to transport their wares: the verb 'dan' means to carry on a shoulderpole. Elderly residents of the city still remember the days when the cries of the noodle sellers -- 'Dan dan mian! Dan dan mian!' -- rang out in all the old lanes. The vendors would lay down their shoulderpoles wherever they found custom, and unpack their stoves, cooking pots, serving bowls, chopsticks and jars of seasonings. Servants would hear their call and rush out to the gateways of the old wooden houses to order noodles for their masters. Mah Jong players, clattering their tiles in a teahouse, would interrupt their game for a bowlful. Passers-by would slurp them in the street. The noodles were served in tiny bowls, a liang at a time, just enough to take the edge off your hunger, and so cheap that almost anyone could afford them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="担担面是土生土长的成都街头小吃，名字来源于挑着扁担的传统街头货郎。“担”是个动词，意思是“挑扁担”。成都的老人们还记得那些卖面人的吆喝，“担担面！担担面！”的声音传遍成都古老的小街小巷。只要有客上门，货郎们就放下担子，支起炉子，烧好水，摆好碗筷和一罐罐调味料。各家的仆人听到他们吆喝，就从那些老旧的木房子中跑出来，站在门口，帮主人叫面吃。正在茶馆里“修长城”的麻将搭子，会暂停牌局，出去吃一碗再说。行人也会停下来，“吸溜吸溜”地吃个面。面都是一小碗一小碗的，每次一两，刚好能垫垫肚子、顶顶饱，而且特别便宜，基本上什么人都买得起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The noodle sellers weren't the only traders on the move; they were part of a thriving and colourful street life for which Chengdu was renowned. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, in the early twentieth century, a guide to the city by Fu Chongju included descriptions and illustrations of some of its many street traders, including itinerant barbers and pedicurists, water-carriers and flower-sellers, menders of parasols and fans, vendors of chicken-feather dusters, knife sharpeners, and snack makers. The old city was a maze of alleys lined with timber-framed houses, their walls made of panels of woven bamboo that were packed with mud and straw, then whitewashed. Stone lions stood on pedestals at either side of imposing wooden gateways. There was a teahouse on almost every street, where waiters with kettles of boiling water scurried around, refilling china bowls of jasmine-scented tea. And amidst the cacophony of the markets and the bustling streets, no sound was more welcome than the cry of a snack-seller, advertising the arrival of some delicious xiao chi, or 'small eat'.</div>

<div class="line_en">The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are remembered as the heyday of Chengdu snacks. Street vendors lived or died by the quality of their cooking, so the secrets of their methods were jealousy guarded. In an atmosphere of fevered competition, individual traders devised new recipes, some of which still bear their names. One man, Zhong Xiesen, invented the divine 'Zhong boiled dumpling' (zhong shui jiao), a tender pork-filled crescent bathed in spiced, sweetened soy sauce and chilli oil, and finished off with a smattering of garlic paste. Another, Lai Yuanxin, left to posterity his squidgy glutinous rice balls (lai tang yuan), stuffed with a paste of toasted black sesame seeds and sugar. A married couple who roamed the streets with their cooking equipment had a relationship so famously harmonious that their speciality -- slices of beef offal tossed with celery and roasted nuts in a fiery dressing of spiced broth, chilli oil and Sichuan pepper -- is still known as 'Man-and-wife lung slices' (fu qi fei pian). The more successful traders often went on to open their own restaurants, usually named after their most celebrated snack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十九世纪末和二十世纪初应该是成都小吃的黄金岁月。货郎们的生死存亡全看小吃的手艺，所以各家都有被别人妒忌猜测却秘而不宣的独门秘方。如此激烈的竞争氛围中，货郎们争先恐后地开发属于自己的新配方，有些到现在还以创始人命名。其中一个叫钟燮森的，发明了极为美味的“钟水饺”：味道清淡的猪肉馅儿包成新月状的饺子，加点甜辣味的酱油和红油，最后来点蒜蓉。还有个赖源鑫，给后人留下了他温香软玉一般的“赖汤圆”：炒过的黑芝麻磨成粉，加上猪油和白糖，包在糯米皮里。一对夫妻，挑着厨具漫步在大街小巷，伉俪情深传为佳话；他们专门卖一种凉菜：白卤牛杂切片，拌上芹菜、花生米、芝麻，加点卤水、红油和花椒面儿，就成了现在著名的“夫妻肺片”。货郎要是做得比较成功，一般会开个餐馆，通常都用自己最著名的那种小吃命名。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the Cultural Revolution, any kind of private enterprise was banned. The teahouses of Chengdu were forced to close, and snack-sellers were banished from the streets. Yet soon after the end of China's 'Decade of Chaos', the old street-food culture heaved itself back into life. Its resurgence was partly a symptom of the 'smashing of the iron ricebowl' -- the post-Mao dismantling of the old socialist system that had guaranteed jobs and incomes for life. Middle-aged workers suddenly found themselves 'laid-off' on subsistence wages, and were forced to find other ways to make money. So some of them would fry up a basketful of ma hua (dough twists) in the mornings, or put together some zong zi (glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves), which they took out into the streets to sell. And there were peasants making a bit on the side in the slack farming season.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“文革”期间，任何形式的私人企业都被禁止了。成都的茶馆被迫关门，货郎也不准上街了。但在中国的“十年浩劫”结束不久，生命力蓬勃的“路边摊”文化重生了。这种东山再起是“砸烂铁饭碗”现象的一部分。很多中年工人发现自己下岗了，只能拿最低工资，因此被迫寻找别的生计。于是有的就早上炸个一篮子的麻花儿，或者包一些粽子，拿到街上来卖。农闲的时候，也有农民挑着自制的小吃到城里来卖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The eyes of the older generation tended to mist over when they recalled the street food of their childhoods. One elderly man I met in a teahouse sat with me for an hour, writing out in meticulous detail a list of dozens of kinds of dumplings, categorised according to their cooking method and main ingredients. A portly and jovial chef in his fifties smiled wistfully as he reminisced: 'Oh, they were all out there on the streets, sold from the shoulderpole, Dan Dan noodles, "Flower" beancurd and toffee.' And he sang for me a long-remembered street vendor's chant: 'I got sweet ones, crispy ones, sugared dough twists!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人们回忆起小时候那些街头吃食，两眼总会泪汪汪的。我在茶馆遇到个太爷，坐在我身边聊了一个多小时，一丝不苟地写下了几十种不同的饺子，根据烹煮的方法和主要的馅料来分类。一个五十多岁、仪表堂堂、热情活泼的大厨带着满足的笑容跟我怀旧：“噢哟，他们都在街（gāi）上挑起扁担卖的，啥子担担面啊、豆花儿啊、丁丁儿糖（3）啊。”他还给我来了段儿过去货郎叫卖的小曲儿：“有甜的脆的～～糖麻花儿～～～！”【注：（3）丁丁糖，即四川人所说的“麻糖”，是经过浓缩扯白的麦芽糖。卖麻糖的小贩都拿着一个小铁板，用铁锤敲打铁板发出叮当的声音招揽顾客，所以得名“丁丁糖”。丁丁糖有止咳化痰、润肺清嗓的作用，只是吃起来比较粘牙。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old streets of the city were endlessly fascinating, and I spent much of my time exploring them. In shady corners, barbers hung mirrors on tree trunks or the walls of convenient buildings, and set up bamboo chairs for their clients, who lay back to be frothed and shaved with cut-throat razors in full view of the street. Knife sharpeners wandered past in dirty aprons, carrying their wooden stools and long, grey whetstones, ready to bring a keen edge to anyone's cleaver. There were mobile haberdasheries, carried on bicycles that were pegged all over with zips, buttons and reels of cotton. Some pedlars sold their own handiwork -- colanders woven from strands of bamboo, or black cotton shoes with padded white soles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城里老街的美妙真是无穷无尽，我的大部分时间就沉迷于其中不断探索。绿荫葱茏的角落，理发匠们把镜子挂在树干或者比较方便挂东西的建筑墙面上，摆好给顾客坐的竹椅子。客人舒舒服服地半躺着，任由对方给自己涂上泡沫，拿锋利得可以割开喉管的刀片刮胡子。眼前是一览无余的街景。磨刀的穿着脏兮兮的围裙慢悠悠地走过去，挑着木头凳子和长长的灰色磨刀石，不管谁提着刀来都能给你磨得削铁如泥。还有流动的杂货店，卖货人骑着自行车，车子两旁挂满了拉链、纽扣和一卷卷棉线。有些小贩会卖自己亲手做的东西，竹编的簸箕、千层底的黑色棉布鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mid-nineties, Chengdu was still a labyrinth of lanes, some of them bordered by grey brick walls punctuated by wooden gateways, others lined with two-storied dwellings built of wood and bamboo. The grand old houses had been divided up into more humble living quarters, plastic signs had been hoisted up above the open shopfronts, and the stone lions had disappeared from their pedestals. But if you closed your eyes to these signs of change, you could imagine yourself walking through a more distant Chinese past.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the alleys there were wine shops, with strong grain spirits sold from enormous clay vats. Some of the wine was steeped with medicinal wolfberries, some -- for the gentlemen, of course -- with assorted animal penises. Flute-sellers wandered among the crowds with bamboo pipes slung all over their bodies, playing a melody as they went. And it was hard to go more than a few yards without being tempted to eat. I might be waylaid by an old man selling sesame balls; distracted by someone selling glutinous rice dumplings wrapped in tangerine leaves from a steamer on the back of a bicycle; or arrested by the scent of eggy pancakes stuffed with jam, fresh from the griddle.</div>

When it rained, sellers of foldaway waterproofs appeared as if by magic; in the soupy summer heat, old men laid out rows of fans on the pavement.

Each one contained a live cricket, a potential pet; together, they hummed like a small orchestra.</div>

I would rush to catch up with him, and he would put down his shoulderpole and the two red-and-black wooden barrels suspended from either end, and set about making me up a bowl of beancurd.

<div class="line_en">I never saw street vendors selling Dan Dan noodles. Like the famous Zhong dumplings and Mr Lai's glutinous riceballs, they had disappeared from their original habitat, and were served instead in specialist snack canteens, or as a kind of amuse-bouche in more glamorous restaurants.

<div class="line_en">Although the name Dan Dan noodles refers only to the way in which the snack was sold from a shoulderpole, over time it has become associated with a particular recipe, in which the noodles are topped with minced meat and ya cai, a famous vegetable preserve whose dark crinkly leaves add salt and savour. Every restaurant serving traditional Sichuanese food has Dan Dan noodles on its menu, and you can now buy Dan Dan noodle sauces in the supermarkets that have sprung up since I first lived in Chengdu. I've lost count of the different versions of the recipe I've tried over the years. Yet in all my wanderings, I have never come across Dan Dan noodles as delicious as those made by Xie Laoban in his modest noodle shop near Sichuan University.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然“担担面”这个名字指的只是这个小吃之前是挑着扁担卖的，但随着时间的推移，“担担面”已经有了专门的菜谱，面上一定要加肉臊子和宜宾芽菜（这是四川著名的腌菜，黑而卷曲的菜干，能增添盐分和风味）。每个卖四川传统小吃的餐厅，菜单上都一定会有担担面。现在你还能在超市里买到专门做担担面的调料包。嗯，从我刚到成都到现在，超市也是雨后春笋般开了一家又一家。多年来我试过很多种担担面菜谱，数也数不清了。但探索这么久，体验这么多，再也没遇到哪一家做得有四川大学附近谢老板那个不起眼的面店那么好吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course I tried to persuade him to give me his recipe, but he would never divulge it in its entirety: instead, he tantalised me with fragments. On one occasion, he grudgingly let me watch his staff assemble the seasonings in the bowls; another time he let me taste his oils and sauces; finally, he told me me the ingredients of his niu rou shao zi, the marvellous minced-beef topping. Eventually, with a great sense of relief and achievement, I managed to put together the pieces of the puzzle, and to reproduce his recipe at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当然软磨硬泡想从他那儿拿到配方，可是他从不会跟我和盘托出，而是一点点地透露了来逗我。有一次，他很勉强地让我看着伙计们往碗里加调味料；还有一次，他让我直接尝尝他的各种油和调料；最后，他跟我讲了牛肉臊子（他的担担面里那美味无双的牛肉碎）的配方。终于，带着极大的解脱与成就感，我把这幅拼图一块块地凑齐了，在家里重现了谢老板的美味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like that until my final visit to his shop, sometime in 2001. This was during the architectural reign of terror of city mayor Li Chuncheng (or Li Chaiqiang -- 'Demolition Li' -- as he was popularly known). Li was a man determined to make his mark on the era by demolishing the old city in its entirety, and replacing it with a modern grid of wide roads lined with concrete high-rises. Great swathes of Chengdu were cleared under his command, not only the more ramshackle dwellings, but opera theatres and grand courtyard houses, famous restaurants and teahouses, and whole avenues of wutong trees. Chengdu hadn't known such ruin and destruction since the Cultural Revolution, when Red Guards dynamited Chengdu's own 'Forbidden City', a complex of courtyards and buildings dating back to the Ming Dynasty (a statue of a waving Mao Zedong now stands in its place).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二零零一年，我最后一次去他的面店，情况才有了点变化。当时地方政府大刀阔斧地拆掉成都老城，让交织的宽阔大道和钢筋水泥的高楼大厦取而代之。一声令下，成都的大片土地被拆得干干净净，不仅是那些老旧的危房，还有川剧戏院和宽阔的院落住宅、著名的餐馆茶馆和那些洒满梧桐绿荫的道路。“文革”结束以来，成都还没经历过这样大规模的拆迁改建。那时候，“红卫兵”们炸毁了皇城，那是成都自己的“紫禁城”，是一个综合了院落与明朝时期楼阁的建筑群。（现在那个地方伫立着一尊毛泽东挥手的塑像。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For years afterwards, whenever my Sichuan University classmates and I returned to Chengdu from Paris, London, Munich, Verona or Krakow, we would go to Xie Laoban's for a nostalgic bowl of Dan Dan noodles. And whatever ends of the earth we had come from, and however many hundreds or even thousands of bowls of noodles we had eaten in his shop in the past, he would look at us without a smile or the merest flicker of recognition, and simply ask in the same deadpan Sichuan dialect, 'Sa zi mian?' If we were lucky, he might give us a perfunctory nod as we left, bidding him goodbye for another year or so. It became a bittersweet joke among us, this refusal to acknowledge who we were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后多年，四川大学那群同学和我，无论是从巴黎、伦敦、慕尼黑、维罗纳还是克拉科夫回到成都，都会来到谢老板店里，吃一碗怀旧的担担面。而不管我们从地球的哪个角落来，不管我们在他的店里吃了几百碗甚至几千碗面，他还是一个笑脸都没有，甚至像不认识一样看着我们，用毫无起伏的四川方言问道：“啥子面？”幸运的话，吃完走人的时候，可能会得到他一个敷衍的点头，表示过个一年左右再见。这成为我们之中一个苦乐参半的笑话。他这种抗拒的态度，恰恰是我们曾经经历的一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lanes around Xie Laoban's noodle shop lay in ruins, bony cadavers of wood and bamboo, and his restaurant clung to one or two other little shops in a precarious island amongst them. When I wandered up for a lunchtime bowl of noodles, Xie Laoban gave me a sunny look and, to my amazement, almost smiled. And as he took orders, settled bills and chatted with his regulars, he seemed mellower and less spiky in his movements. By his own standards, he was radiant with bonhomie. What was behind this miraculous transformation? Had he fallen in love, or won a fortune at Mah Jong? Or had the obliteration of the city, and the impending destruction of his business, just filled him with a sense of the lightness of being? I shall never know. I sat there and ate my noodles, which were as fabulous as ever, and then it was time to go. I never saw Xie Laoban again. Later that year, I went to look for him. I wanted to tell him that I had described him and his shop in my Sichuanese cookery book, and published his recipe for Dan Dan noodles, which was now being read and perhaps cooked by a network of Sichuanese food fans all over the world. But the place where his noodle shop had stood was a moonscape of debris, a great plain of rubble, scattered here and there with shattered pickle jars and ricebowls. And none of the passers-by knew where I could find him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢老板面店周围的街巷全都是一片断瓦残垣，废弃的木梁和竹条横七竖八地躺着。他的餐馆和另外一两家小店伫立在其中，如同岌岌可危的孤岛。我散步过来，想吃碗面当午饭。谢老板向我投来热情的目光，差点就笑了，真是让我受宠若惊。让客人点餐、给客人结账、和常客聊天的时候，他性格也似乎温柔了些，举手投足也没那么不好惹了。和这人以前的样子相比，现在他真是散发着温厚和蔼的光芒。这奇迹般的转变是为了什么呢？他爱上什么人了吗？还是麻将桌上赢了一大笔钱？或者因为城市的改建，他的生意也行将结束，他终于感觉到了生命的轻盈松快？答案我永远不得而知。我再也没见过谢老板。那一年的后来，我还去找过他，想告诉他我把他和他的店写进了自己的四川烹饪书，公开发表了他的担担面的菜谱。全世界的川菜迷们都在读，也许还照着做了。但他的面馆曾经伫立的地方，只留下一片拆除后的残骸，如同月球表面一望无际的碎石，偶有打碎的泡菜坛子和饭碗散落其中。来来往往的人中，也没有一个知道他的下落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, in my first year in Chengdu, the idea of writing a Sichuanese cookery book hadn't even occurred to me. And it would have been hard, then, to believe that such a vibrant old city would disappear in just a few short years. I passed my time there in pleasure and idleness. One day I might spend hours in a teahouse, memorising Chinese characters; on another I might decide to visit a nearby fishing village to see what people there were cooking for lunch. Some friends and I began taking Qi Gong lessons from a retired Chinese doctor in the shady gardens of the Qing Yang Gong Taoist Temple, where we learned to sense and control the energy flowing around our bodies. The Russians, Sasha and Pasha, persuaded one of the illegal cinemas to hold a special screening of Pulp Fiction (a bootleg copy), which turned into a riotous party. With my German friend Volker and eight other foreign students I hired a bus for a wild trip to eastern Tibet. But on many days, I simply meandered around the old streets of Chengdu on my bicycle, waiting for something to happen. And it usually did.</div>

<div class="line_en">In one of my favourite teahouses, I befriended an ear-cleaner called Xiao Chang'an. I was familiar with the sound of him before we ever met. I liked to lie back in my bamboo chair, eyes closed, a bowl of jasmine tea by my side, listening out for the street vendors as they passed. A sharp, metallic twang heralded the arrival of the ear-cleaner, his shirt pocket filled with a terrifying array of instruments: little knives, copper spikes and tiny scoops, and a few delicate goose-feather brushes. Xiao Chang'an was a regular in this particular teahouse, and I had often watched him poking his instruments into the ears of teahouse customers, who lounged in their chairs with expressions of extreme bliss on their faces. One day we struck up a conversation, and he told me about his trade. He explained about the acupressure points that he stimulated with his little prongs and knives, and told me that the art of ear-cleaning dated back to the Song Dynasty. 'These days,' he said, 'some women use ear-cleaning as a cover for prostitution. They may carry the right tools, but they have no idea how to pleasure an ear.' I was intrigued by everything he told me, but much too scared to let him give me a practical demonstration of his art.</div>

<div class="line_en">One sunny afternoon, however, after I'd known him for a while, my resistance crumbled. I settled back nervously in my chair and let him have his way with me. He began by gently drawing back my hair, and stroking the skin around my ear with a small blunt knife, sending shivers of pleasure all over my body. Silent and concentrated, he then began to scrape and probe inside my ear with his little scoops and copper prongs, and to twirl around a series of feather brushes. The most thrilling sensations came when he placed a brush in my ear and then touched its handle several times with his humming tuning fork. The vibrations sent a rhythmic sound like the buzz of a grasshopper into the depths of my ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，跟他认识好一阵子了，在一个阳光灿烂的午后，我的防线崩溃了。我紧张地坐在椅子上，任由他摆布。他先轻轻地把我耳朵往后拉了拉，然后拿一把小小的钝刀敲打周围的皮肤，让我全身愉悦地颤抖起来。他一言不发、全神贯注，开始拿着小小的挖耳勺和铜钉子在我耳朵里戳来刮去，还不时把羽毛刷子伸进去刷一刷。最令人兴奋得战栗的是，他把刷子伸进我耳朵，又用那把能发出清脆声音的叉子在把手上敲打了好几次。两者的震动产生了美妙的韵律，如同有只蚱蜢在我耳根深处鸣叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Life in Chengdu often seemed surreal. The most extraordinary things happened on a daily basis. It was impossible for any of us foreign students to have a 'normal' life there, anyway. Whatever we did was inherently eccentric and fascinating in the eyes of the locals. We were recruited to appear in advertisements and films; images of our faces were printed on packets of soap. I spent a day at a theme park, dressed up in a Spanish flamenco costume and full stage make-up, chosen for a role in a commercial on account, said the director, of my 'mysterious eyes'. If we had striven to go about our lives in a discreet and boring manner, we would still have drawn crowds and gasps of amazement wherever we went.

<div class="line_en">One night, I took a taxi with my Italian friends Francesca and Katya to a dinner party in another part of town. We hadn't gone far when the taxi broke down in the middle of a vast open junction (there were few private cars then, and no traffic lights, so vehicles just wove their way across these massive intersections in an ad hoc manner). Our driver got out to tinker with the engine. We were in a stupid, drunken mood, giddy with hilarity, so we shoved a rock cassette into the car stereo, turned the volume up to the maximum, stepped out into the road and began to dance. Our driver smiled at us indulgently, as people tended to do. Soon another taxi ground to a halt beside us, and its driver leapt out to gawp at the spectacle of three laughing foreign girls dancing in the middle of the road. It was followed by another, and another, until the whole space was gridlocked with a crazy zigzag of abandoned taxis, twenty or thirty of them. At that point our driver got the engine running again, so we jumped back in, wove our way out of the chaos of parked cars and zoomed off, looking back at a sea of astonished faces.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember one hair-raising lunchtime when Zhang Changyu, a kindly scholar of culinary history whom I had met through my Chinese teacher, invited me out for hotpot, and ordered a whole dishful of expensive pig's brains, just for me. He scooped them up in a little wire sieve, which he dipped into the simmering broth. And then he turned the brains into my seasoning bowl, where they sank gently into the sesame oil and chopped garlic. At first I tried to hide them under the garlic, and to flip them on to the waste plate with the fishbones, distracting him with lively conversation. But it just didn't work. Every time I 'lost' some brains by my feeble subterfuge, he would tip some more into my bowl. In the end, I just ate them, with a sense of grim resignation. They were as soft as custard, and dangerously rich.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对一次令人毛骨悚然的午饭记忆犹新。我通过汉语老师认识了一个研究烹饪史的学者，人很好，邀请我出去吃火锅，然后点了一大盘很贵的猪脑花，说是专门给我吃。他用小漏勺把脑花放进咕嘟冒泡的汤底，煮熟了倒进我的味碟中。脑花温柔地沉浸在香油和蒜蓉当中。一开始我想把它藏在蒜蓉下面，或者跟他聊个热火朝天，再趁他不注意偷偷和鱼骨头一起倒了。但根本没用。每次我自以为聪明地刚“处理”掉一点儿脑花，他就往我碗里再加一点。最后，我心一横、眼一闭，张口就吃了。那口感像奶冻，柔软绵密，又有很丰富的层次，真是危险的诱惑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In such a bizarre context, it wasn't surprising that my own tastes were becoming ever more adventurous. At first, like most foreigners, I steered away from the wilder waters of Chinese cuisine. Dining out with my classmates, I would order chicken or pork rather than frog or loach, and always choose flesh over offal. But as I made more Chinese friends, it became impossible to continue with such fastidiousness, if only because of my English good manners. Some well-meaning Chinese person was always plopping a bit of pig's intestine or cartilage into my ricebowl, as a special favour.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes my reticence over a particular food was overcome through simple drunkenness. The Chengdu equivalent of the late-night döner kebab in 1994 was fried rabbit-heads, a snack I'd heard about from a Canadian friend. I'd seen the rabbit-heads sitting ominously in glass cabinets, earless and skinless, staring out with beady rabbit eyes and pointy teeth. The idea of eating one was utterly revolting. But one night, after a long dancing session, I fetched up at a street stall bedraggled and hungry. My reason befuddled by alcohol, I ate my first rabbit-head, cleft in half and tossed in a wok with chilli and spring onion. I won't begin to describe the silky richness of the flesh along the jaw, the melting softness of the eyeball, the luxuriant smoothness of the brain. Suffice it to say that from that day on I ate stir-fried rabbit-heads almost every Saturday night. (Later I learned that a Sichuanese slang term for snogging is chi tu lao kenr -- eating rabbit-heads.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，简简单单的一场醉酒，就能打破我对某种食物的禁忌。一九九四年的成都，有种食物和土耳其烤肉在英国一样，都是深夜的街头最受欢迎的小吃，那就是兔脑壳。这还是个加拿大朋友告诉我的。我目睹了兔脑壳在玻璃橱柜里一列排开，散发着不详的气息，没有耳朵、没有脸皮，兔眼珠子直勾勾看着你，尖尖的牙齿一览无余。光想想有人吃这个，我就要吐了。但是一天晚上，上了节时间不短的舞蹈课之后，我又累又饿，跑到一个路边摊觅食。几杯酒下肚，理智给酒精让位，我吃了人生第一只兔头：一切两半，撒了点辣椒和葱花。我不想跟你细说下巴上的肉口感多么厚实丰富，眼睛那块儿是多么柔软、多么入口即化，兔脑髓多么顺滑绵密。我只想说，从那天开始，我几乎每个周六晚上都会点炒兔脑壳来吃。（后来我才知道，四川方言里会把亲嘴儿叫“啃兔脑壳儿”。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Affection, too, played a part in my growing omnivorousness. Affection for my Chinese friends, who would offer me wobbly morsels of dubious-looking food with expressions of such eager and expectant kindness that I couldn't refuse. And a growing love also for Chengdu, for Sichuan, and for China. Sometimes the most disgusting things can taste delicious when they are associated with a familiar and beloved place. Aside from the offal and the weird delicacies, certain unlikely snacks became part of my Chinese gastronomic landscape. Huo tui chang, pale pink 'sausages' made from an unspeakable mix of reconstituted pork and cereal squirted into a red plastic sheath, were sold on every railway platform in China. Eating them became part of the ritual of long train journeys. They still make me nostalgic and I can't resist buying them occasionally, even though nothing would induce me to eat that kind of thing in England. I also became addicted to ta ta bubblegum, which was sold as a long, spiralling pink ribbon in a flat round box: this is probably why, having had perfect teeth until the age of twenty-five, I went home to England after my time in Sichuan and had to have seven fillings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="情感也越来越把我变成一个“杂食动物”。我喜爱的中国朋友们会给我一些看上去很可疑的食物，脸上的表情既急切又满怀期待、充满善意，我真是无法拒绝。我对成都、四川和中国的爱也在与日俱增。有时候，只要和一个熟悉喜爱的地方连在一起，即使看上去特别恶心的东西吃起来也相当美味了。除了内脏和奇奇怪怪的山珍海味，我的中国烹饪之旅还充满了各种各样以前想也想不到的零食。比如火腿肠，一种粉白粉白的所谓“香肠”；原料嘛，不可说不可说：人工再造的猪肉，加上一些谷物淀粉，用红红的塑料皮套起来；中国所有的铁路站台上都有卖。每当我坐火车进行长途旅行，吃火腿肠都变成了一种仪式。直到现在我也会十分怀念，偶尔还会无法抗拒地买上一根，尽管英国没有任何情境会触发我去吃那样的东西。我还对“大大”泡泡糖上了瘾。特别是“大大卷”，粉红色的带状泡泡糖卷成一圈，装在一个扁圆的盒子里。也许就是因为吃这个吃多了，二十五岁以前牙齿健康状况还堪称完美的我，从四川回到英国的时候，竟然有七处龋齿要补。">查看中文翻译</div>
