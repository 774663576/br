<div class="line_en">Hermione led the way down the stairs into the Entrance Hall. The din of loud voices and the clatter of cutlery on plates echoed from out of the double doors to the Great Hall -- it seemed incredible to Harry that twenty feet away were people who were enjoying dinner, celebrating the end of exams, not a care in the world…</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had no idea what Hermione was planning, or even whether she had a plan. He walked half a pace behind her as they headed down the corridor outside Umbridge's office, knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going. He did not dare attempt to talk to her; Umbridge was walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不知道赫敏打算做什么，甚至都不清楚她是否已经有了某种打算。他离开半步之遥跟在她身后，沿着乌姆里奇办公室外的走廊缓缓地向前走去．心里想着如果自己看上去不知道他们要去哪里，那可太容易让人起疑了。乌姆里奇紧跟在他们后面，近得足以让哈利听得见她粗重的呼吸声，所以他不敢跟赫敏说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione walked straight out of the oak front doors and down the stone steps into the balmy evening air. The sun was falling towards the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Forest now, and as Hermione marched purposefully across the grass -- Umbridge jogging to keep up -- their long dark shadows rippled over the grass behind them like cloaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏径直穿过栎木大门走下石头台阶，走进傍晚温和的空气中。太阳正在禁林的树梢那边渐渐西沉，赫敏故意大步穿过草地——乌姆里奇小跑着跟上她——他们身后长长的黑影像斗篷一样在草地上泛起波纹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么…它在哪儿呢？”当赫敏继续大步走向禁林时，乌姆里奇带着几分怀疑的语气问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She laughed. Harry felt a strong urge to swing round and seize her by the throat, but resisted. His scar was throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned white-hot, as he knew it would if Voldemort had moved in for the kill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她笑了起来。哈利真想转过身去掐住她的喉咙，但是他忍住了。他的伤疤在傍晚柔和的微风中悸动作痛，但还没有灼痛到极点。他知道，如果伏地魔将要开始杀戮，自己的伤疤一定会有那样的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can we have your wand, then, if we're going first?" Harry asked her.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they reached the cool shade of the first trees, Harry tried to catch Hermione's eye; walking into the Forest without wands seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening. She, however, merely gave Umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the trees, moving at such a pace that Umbridge, with her shorter legs, had difficulty in keeping up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们来到第一排树木阴森的树阴下时，哈利想截住赫敏的目光；在他看来，不带魔杖就进入禁林比起他们到今天傍晚为止所做过的任何事情都更冒失。但赫敏只是轻蔑地扫了一眼乌姆里奇，接着径直冲进了树林里，步子快得让短腿的乌姆里奇很难跟得上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry's misgivings increased. Hermione was not taking the path they had followed to visit Grawp, but the one he followed three years ago to the lair of the monster Aragog. Hermione had not been with him on that occasion; he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利更加疑惑了。赫敏走的并不是他们去看望格洛普时的那条小路，而是三年前自己去怪物阿拉戈克的巢穴时走的路。当时赫敏并没有跟着他；哈利怀疑，她根本不清楚危险就在这条路的尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is it very far in?" Umbridge asked, as her robe ripped on a bramble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它在里面很远的地方吗？”乌姆里奇问道，这时她的长袍被荆棘扯破了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Er -- are you sure this is the right way?" he asked her pointedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯——你确定就是这条路吗？”他话里有话地问赫敏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes," said Hermione, "yes, it's well hidden."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，”赫敏说，“没错，它被藏得很严实。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes," she said in a steely voice, crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought was a wholly unnecessary amount of noise. Behind them, Umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling. Neither of them paused to help her up again; Hermione merely strode on, calling loudly over her shoulder, "It's a bit further in!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，没错。”赫敏一边斩钉截铁地回答一边穿过低矮的丛林，弄出一阵在哈利看来完全没有必要的巨大动静。在他们后面，乌姆里奇被一棵倒在地上的小树绊倒了，可他们俩谁都没有停下把她扶起来；赫敏只是一个劲儿地大步向前走，一边还扭过头大声对后面喊着：“就在前面，不远了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked on for what seemed a long time, until they were once again so deep into the Forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light. Harry had the feeling he had had before in the Forest, one of being watched by unseen eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们好像又走了很长一段时间，直到他们来到禁林深处，浓密的树冠遮住了所有的光线。哈利感觉自己正被看不到的眼睛注视着，以前他在禁林里曾经有过这种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How much further?" demanded Umbridge angrily from behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有多远？”乌姆里奇在他身后生气地问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head. The air was suddenly full of the sound of hooves; Harry could feel the Forest floor trembling; Umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一支箭从空中飞过，砰的一声恰好落在赫敏头顶上方的树上，那声音令人毛骨悚然。突然马蹄声响彻空中，哈利能够感觉到禁林的地面正在颤动。乌姆里奇小声尖叫了一声，把哈利当成盾牌推到了前面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wrenched himself free of her and turned. Around fifty centaurs were emerging on every side, their bows raised and loaded, pointing at Harry, Hermione and Umbridge. They backed slowly into the centre of the clearing, Umbridge uttering odd little whimpers of terror. Harry looked sideways at Hermione. She was wearing a triumphant smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利挣脱了她，转过身来。大约五_卜个马人出现在四面八方，拉弓搭箭瞄向哈利、赫敏和乌姆里奇。他们慢慢地退到空地中央，乌姆里奇吓得小声呜咽起来，听上去怪怪的。哈利看了看旁边的赫敏，她的脸上正带着得意的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked left. The chestnut-bodied centaur called Magorian was walking towards them out of the circle: his bow, like those of the others, was raised. On Harry's right, Umbridge was still whimpering, her wand trembling violently as she pointed it at the advancing centaur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利朝左边望去。那个叫玛格瑞的红棕色马人离开包围圈向他们走过来：他的弓像其他马人一样举了起来。在哈利右边，乌姆里奇还在抽泣，她的魔杖指向正在逼近的马人，抖得很厉害。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't call them that!" Hermione said furiously, but Umbridge did not appear to have heard her.

<div class="line_cn" title="“不要这样叫他们！”赫敏急切地说，可乌姆里奇好像没有听见。她仍在用抖动的魔杖指着玛格瑞，继续说，“法律的第十五条第二款明确规定：被认为具有接近人类智力的魔法生物必须对它们的攻击行为负责——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you doing in our Forest?" bellowed the hard-faced grey centaur Harry and Hermione had seen on their last trip into the Forest. "Why are you here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们在我们的禁林里干什么？”一个脸上有深深皱纹的灰色马人吼道，哈利与赫敏上一次来禁林时曾经遇到过他，“你们为什么来这里？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“接近人类的智力？”玛格瑞重复着，贝恩与其他几个马人愤怒地咆哮着，用蹄子刨着地面，“我们认为这是个莫大的污辱，人类！谢天谢地，我们的智慧远远超过你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your Forest?" said Umbridge, shaking now not only with fright but also, it seemed, with indignation. "I would remind you that you live here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land --"</div>

<div class="line_en">An arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing: she let out an ear-splitting scream and threw her hands over her head, while some of the centaurs bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously.

<div class="line_en">"Yes!" he whispered, moving towards them. They tossed their reptilian heads, throwing back long black manes, and Harry stretched out his hand eagerly and patted the nearest one's shining neck; how could he ever have thought them ugly?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了！”他小声说着朝它们走过去。它们晃了晃爬虫般的脑袋，长长的黑色鬃毛向后甩去，哈利急切地伸出一只手，轻轻拍了拍离自己最近的那匹夜骐亮闪闪的脖子；心想自己以前怎么会认为它们丑陋呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry whirled round. Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two Thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利转过身，看到两匹夜骐正站在两棵树之间，胆怯地眨动着白色眼睛，注视着这场秘密谈话，就好像每一句话它们都能听懂似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is it those mad horse things?" said Ron uncertainly, staring at a point slightly to the left of the Thestral Harry was patting. "Those ones you can't see unless you've watched someone snuff it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是那种什么疯马吗？”罗恩半信半疑地说，盯着哈利正在轻轻拍打的夜骐身体左边一点儿的地方，“就是那些见过死人的人才能看见的东西？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They burst into more protests. His scar gave another, more painful, twinge. Every moment they delayed was precious; he did not have time to argue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们立刻提出了更多的抗议。哈利的伤疤又一次更加剧烈地疼痛起来，他们拖延的每一分钟都十分宝贵；他没有工夫去争辩了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think there are six of us, actually," said Luna calmly, counting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“事实上，我认为我们需要六匹。”卢娜一边数着一边平静地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, we need three," said Hermione, who was still looking a little shaken, but determined just the same.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，会有更多的夜骐到这里来的，”金妮信心十足地说。她很高兴罗恩正斜眼看着完全错误的方向，显然是她的表情让罗恩以为她正盯着那些马呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不想留在后面！”赫敏着急地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry felt a soft tug on his robes at that moment and looked down to see the closest Thestral licking his sleeve, which was damp with Grawp's blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because, in case you hadn't noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood," she said coolly, "and we know Hagrid lures Thestrals with raw meat. That's probably why these two turned up in the first place."</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry turned: no fewer than six or seven Thestrals were picking their way through the trees, their great leathery wings folded tight to their bodies, their eyes gleaming through the darkness. He had no excuse now.</div>
