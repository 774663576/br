<div class="line_en">Followed by the count, the baron led the way through a long succession of apartments characterized by tedious ostentation and expensive bad taste, until they reached Mme Danglars' boudoir, a small octagonal room hung with red satin and trimmed with Indian muslin. The chairs were in antique gilded wood and covered in old fabrics. Above the doors were paintings of shepherds and shepherdesses in the style of Boucher. Two pretty pastels, in oval frames, complementing the rest of the décor, made this little room the only one in the house with some individuality. Admittedly, it had been overlooked in the general design agreed between M. Danglars and his architect, one of the most famous and eminent members of his profession under the empire, so only the baroness and Lucien Debray were involved in doing it up. Danglars, a great admirer of Antiquity -- as interpreted by the Directoire -- consequently had nothing but contempt for this charming little cubbyhole to which, in any case, he was usually admitted only on condition that he brought someone with him to excuse his presence. So in reality it was not Danglars who introduced visitors, but he himself who was introduced, to be received well or ill, depending on how much the visitor's face pleased or displeased the baroness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mme Danglars, who could still be described as beautiful despite her thirty-six years, was at the piano, a little masterpiece of cabinet-making, while Lucien Debray was sitting at an embroidery table, leafing through an album.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before their arrival, Lucien had had time to tell the baroness several things about the count. The reader knows what an impression Monte Cristo made on Albert's guests over luncheon; though Debray was not easily susceptible to such impressions, this one had not yet faded, but left its mark on the details he gave to the baroness. Mme Danglars' curiosity, excited some time before by what she had learned from Morcerf, and now by Lucien, was consequently at its apogee. The tableau with the piano and the album was just one of those little social ruses which help to disguise one's preparations, and the baroness greeted M. Danglars with a smile, which was unusual on her part. As for the count, he received a solemn but graceful curtsey in exchange for his bow, while Lucien gave him a nod, acknowledging the brevity of their acquaintanceship, greeting Danglars in more intimate fashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吕西安趁伯爵未到以前已讲了许多他的特点给邓格拉司夫人听。我们还会记得，在阿尔培·马瑟夫的早餐席上，基督山已在全体来宾的脑子里留下一个生动的印象。狄布雷虽然不是一个易受感动的人，但那个印象却还没有从他的脑子里消褪，他对男爵夫人讲伯爵的事，就是根据那个印象叙述的。邓格拉司夫人以前已听马瑟夫详详细细地讲过，现在又经吕西安这末一说，所以竟大大地引起了她的好奇心。钢琴和纪念册是社交上的一种欺骗手段，借此可以掩盖他们的注意力。邓格拉司蒙赐到一个最和蔼难得的微笑；伯爵则以绅士风度的一躬换得了文雅一礼；吕西安和伯爵客气的打了个招呼，他只是向邓格拉司随随便便地点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have only one thing to say about him, but it is one that will instantly make him the darling of all our lovely ladies: he has come to Paris, intending to stay here for a year, and in that time to spend six million francs, so we can expect a series of balls, dinners and feasts, in which I hope the count will not forget us, any more than we shall forget him in our own humble entertainments."</div>

Among these ten, there were two which belong to me, delightful creatures, the finest horses in Paris. You know them, Monsieur Debray: my dappled greys. Well, just when Madame de Villefort is to borrow my carriage, which I promised to her so that she could go in it tomorrow to the Bois, the two horses suddenly cannot be found!

<div class="line_en">Ali went down into the street and drew a line on the cobbles. Then he came back and showed the line to the count, who had been watching him. The count tapped him gently on the shoulder, which was his way of expressing his thanks. Then the Nubian went to smoke his chibouk on the corner-stone between the house and the street, while Monte Cristo paid no further heed to the matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿里走到街上，对正进门的走道划了一条直线，然后他回来把那条线指给在一旁的伯爵看。伯爵轻轻地拍拍他的背，他一向总是用这种方法来称赞阿里的，阿里很喜欢这项差使，镇定地走到房子和街道相接的拐角上，在一块凸出的石头上坐下来，开始抽他的长烟筒，而基督山则回到屋里，不再管这件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly there was a distant sound of rumbling, which approached at thunderous speed, then a barouche appeared, drawn by horses which the coachman was vainly trying to restrain as they dashed wildly forward, bristling and lunging madly this way and that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，隐约听到了车轮急速滚过来的声音，而且立刻就出现了一辆马车，拖车的那一对马已野性复发，简直无法控制，它们拚命地向前冲，象是有魔鬼在鞭策它们一样，那吓坏了的车夫竭力想控制住它们，但是枉然。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, at about five o'clock, which was the time when the count expected the carriage to arrive, one might have observed in him some almost imperceptible signs of impatience. He walked up and down in a room overlooking the street, listening out from time to time and occasionally going across to the window, through which he could see Ali expelling puffs of smoke with a regularity that showed he was entirely absorbed in the important business of smoking his chibouk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly Ali put down his chibouk, took the lasso out of his pocket, threw it and wrapped it three times round the front legs of the left-hand horse. He was pulled three or four yards by the shock but, after these few yards, the lassoed horse came down, falling against the shaft, which it broke, thwarting the efforts of its companion to continue racing forward. The coachman took advantage of the momentary pause to leap off his box, but Ali had already grasped the nostrils of the second horse in his iron fingers and the animal, whinnying in pain, had dropped, shuddering, to the ground beside its fellow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是阿里放下他的长烟筒，从他的口袋里抽出套索，巧妙地一摔，正巧把绳圈套住离他较近的那匹马的前蹄，忍痛让自己被马拖了几步，在这几步的时间内，那条巧妙地投出去的套索已逐渐收紧，终于把那匹狂怒的马的两脚完全拴住，使它跌倒在地上，这匹马跌到辕杆上，折断了辕杆，使另外那匹马也无法再向前跑。车夫利用这个机会从他的座位上跳下来，但阿里已敏捷地抓住第二匹马的鼻孔，用他的铁腕死命的抓住，直到那头发疯的畜生痛苦地喷着气，软瘫在它的同伴旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the barouche was a young woman, clasping a child of seven or eight years old in such an excess of terror that she had even lost the strength to cry out. A stone under the wheel or the branch of a tree would have been enough to smash the coach to pieces.

<div class="line_en">The interval was enough, however, for a man to rush out of the house opposite which the accident happened, followed by several servants. Just as the coachman was opening the door of the coach, the man lifted out the lady, one of whose hands was grasping the upholstery of the seat while the other clasped her son, who was senseless with fear. Monte Cristo carried both of them into the drawing-room and set them down on a sofa, saying: "Have no fear, Madame. You are safe."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福夫人的脸色变得非常苍白，抓住她儿子的臂膀，把他拖到自己身边，但看到他没出事，她自己也向那只小箱子瞟了一眼，这一眼虽短，但却意味深长，当然没有逃过伯爵的慧眼。这时，阿里进来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the momentary silence, the count had time to look at the child, whom the mother was smothering in kisses. He was small and lanky, with a whiteness of skin more common in redheads. However, an unruly forest of black hair covered his domed forehead and, falling across his shoulders on each side of his face, doubled the light of juvenile cunning and spitefulness that shone from his eyes. His broad mouth and slender lips were just recovering their colour; this eight-year-old's features were those of a child of twelve, at least. His first movement was brusquely to shake himself free of his mother's arms and to go across to the chest from which the count had taken the phial of elixir. Immediately he opened it and, without asking permission, like a child used to having his every whim satisfied, began to take the stoppers off the bottles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这短暂的沉默期间，基督山带着最温柔亲切的神色仔细地观察那蜷伏在她怀里的孩子，观察他的身体和相貌。那个孩子发育不足，脸色特别苍白。头发直而黑，虽然曾想法使它卷曲，却并没有多大的效果，有一大绺头发从他那凸出的前额上挂下来，直垂到他的肩头，那一对充满了狡猾阴险和顽皮执拗的眼睛显得十分机灵活泼。他的嘴巴很大，嘴唇极薄，还没有恢复血色；从这个孩子的脸上，一眼就可以看出他的个性深沉而诡谲，他的面貌倒实在象是一个十三四岁的孩子，不象是这样年幼的。他的第一个动作是猛地一推，挣出他母亲的怀抱，向伯爵装救命良药的那只小箱子冲过去，然后，他没得到任何人的许可，开始把药瓶的塞子一个个地拔出来，充分显示出是一个从来没受过约束的怪癖任性的、被宠坏了的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">DEAR HERMINE, I have just been miraculously saved, together with my son, by that same Count of Monte Cristo about whom we spoke so much yesterday evening, but whom I never thought I should see today. Yesterday you spoke to me of him with such enthusiasm that it took all the strength of my feeble spirit to refrain from mockery, but today I find your enthusiasm falls well below the man who inspired it. On reaching the Ranelagh, your horses bolted as if touched by madness and we should probably have been dashed to pieces, poor Edouard and I, against the first tree on the road or the first village signpost, when an Arab, a Negro, a Nubian, in short, a black man, one of the count's servants, I believe, at a sign from the count, stopped the horses in their tracks, though at the risk of being run down himself; indeed, it is a miracle that he was not. The count ran out and had us carried into his house, Edouard and me, where he brought my son back to life. I returned home in his own carriage; yours will be sent back to you tomorrow. You will find your horses much enfeebled after the accident. It is as though they were stunned: one would think they could not forgive themselves for having been tamed by a man. The count asks me to tell you that two days' rest on straw and no food except barley will restore them to as healthy -- that is to say, as terrifying -- a state as before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="〖“亲爱的霭敏：我刚才从九死一生的危险中神奇地逃了出来，我的安全得归功于我们昨天所谈到的那位基督山伯爵，但我决想不到今天就会看见他。我记得当你称赞他的时候，我曾怎样无情地加以嘲笑，以为你的话太夸大了，可是我现在却有充分的理由来承认：你对于这位奇人的描写虽然热情，但对于他的优点却远未尽述。但我一定竭力把我这次的奇遇讲得更明了一点。你必须知道，我亲爱的朋友，当我驾着你的马到达兰拉夫街的时候，它们突然象发了疯似的向前直冲，疾驰得这样怕人，以致只要有什么东西挡住它们的去路，我和我那可怜的爱德华一定会撞得粉碎，当时我觉得不会有希望了，忽然一个容貌古怪的人——是一个阿拉伯人或努比亚人，总之，是哪一国的一个黑人——在伯爵的一个手势之下（他原是伯爵的仆人），突然来抓住了那匹暴怒的牲口，甚至冒着他自己被踩死的危险，而他之得免于死，实在是极其侥幸的。那时，伯爵急忙来接我们，把我们带到他的家里，用某种巧妙的医法迅速地救活了我那可怜的爱德华（他已吓得失去知觉了）。当我们的精神已完全恢复的时候，他用自己的马车送我们回家。你的马车明天还你。我恐怕你得有好几天不能用你的马了，它们似乎已完全麻木了，象是极不高兴让那个黑人来征服它们似的。但伯爵托我向你保证，只要让它们休息两三天，在那期间，多给它们吃点大麦，而且以大麦为惟一的饲料，它们就会长得象昨天一样的肥壮——那就是说，象昨天一样的可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, in the midst of a large crowd, attracted to the street outside the house by the remains of the carriage and the rumour of what had happened, Ali had the horses harnessed to the count's coupé, took up the reins, got on the box and, to the great astonishment of those present who had seen these same horses rushing forward as though driven by a tornado, was obliged to make good use of the whip before they would set off. Even then, the best he could obtain from these famous dappled greys, now stunned and petrified, was such a listless and uncertain trot that it took Mme de Villefort nearly two hours to return to her home in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Hardly had she arrived and reassured her family than she sat down to write the following letter to Mme Danglars:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，也不管那围聚在马车四周的人群是多么嘈杂，阿里静静地把那两匹驯服了的马套到伯爵的四轮轻马车上，把缰绳捏在手里，爬上御者的座位，于是“罗！”地喊了一声。使旁观者极其惊奇的是：他们刚才虽目睹这两匹马曾发疯般狂奔，倔强难治，但现在阿里却得用他的鞭子不客气地抽打几下它们才肯迈步。但即使如此，他也只能使它们以缓慢的步伐踯躅而行。这两匹有名的灰斑马现在已变成了一对迟钝愚笨的顽畜，它们的行动是这样的艰难，以致维尔福夫人花了两个钟头才回到圣·奥诺路她的家里。她一到家，先满足了家里人的探问，然后立刻写了下面这封信给邓格拉司夫人：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Farewell! I do not thank you for my ride; yet, on reflection, it is ungrateful of me to blame you for the capriciousness of your horses, because I owe them the opportunity of meeting the Count of Monte Cristo and, apart from his millions, this illustrious foreigner seems to me so odd and so interesting an enigma that I intend to study him at any price, even if it means another ride in the Bois with your horses.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening, the accident at Auteuil was the subject of every conversation. Albert spoke of it to his mother, Château-Renaud at the Jockey-Club and Debray in the minister's drawing-room. Even Beauchamp paid the count the tribute, in his paper, of a twenty-line news item which presented the noble foreigner as a hero to all the women of the aristocracy. Several people went to leave their cards at Mme de Villefort's so that they would be able to pay a second visit at the appropriate time and hear the details of this exotic event from her own lips.</div>
