<div class="line_en">The mists of evening had begun to rise, sending grey fingers up the walls of the buildings that lined the old canal. "He promised he'd be back," Sam said. "You heard him too."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gilly looked at him with eyes red-rimmed and puffy. Her hair hung about her face, unwashed and tangled. She looked like some wary animal peering through a bush. It had been days since they'd last had a fire, yet the wildling girl liked to huddle near the hearth, as if the cold ashes still held some lingering warmth. "He doesn't like it here with us," she said, whispering so as not to wake the babe. "It's sad here. He likes it where the wine is, and the smiles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉莉看了看他。她的眼眶又红又肿，肮脏杂乱的头发耷拉在脸庞周围。她就像一只小心谨慎的动物，透过灌木丛向外张望。最后一次生火取暖已是好几天前的事了，然而野人女孩喜欢蜷缩在火炉边，仿佛冷冷的灰烬中仍然存有余温。“他不喜欢跟我们在一起，”她轻声说，以免吵醒婴儿，“这是个可怜的地方，而他想要红酒与微笑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam stood before the window, rocking nervously as he watched the last light of the sun vanish behind a row of sharp-peaked rooftops. He must have gotten drunk again, he thought glumly. Or else he's met another girl. He did not know whether to curse or weep. Dareon was supposed to be his brother. Ask him to sing, and no one could be better. Ask him to do aught else…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆站在窗前，不安地摇晃，注视着最后一道阳光消失在一排尖屋顶后面。他一定又喝醉了，他阴郁地想，要不就是遇上另一个女孩。他不知该咒骂还是哭泣。戴利恩是他的兄弟。他唱歌没人比得上，但要他干任何别的事…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, thought Sam, and the wine is everywhere but here. Braavos was full of inns, alehouses, and brothels. And if Dareon preferred a fire and a cup of mulled wine to stale bread and the company of a weeping woman, a fat craven, and a sick old man, who could blame him? I could blame him. He said he would be back before the gloaming; he said he would bring us wine and food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，山姆心想，除了这里，到处都有酒。布拉佛斯充斥着客栈、酒馆和妓院，如果戴利恩喜欢炉火和温酒，不要陈腐的面包，不愿跟一个哭泣的女人、一个肥胖的胆小鬼和一个生病的老人做伴，谁能责怪他呢？也许我有资格责怪他。他说黄昏之前会回来，他说会给我们带回红酒和食物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That made him angry too. Dareon was not supposed to be making up songs about courtesans. He was supposed to be singing about the Wall and the valor of the Night's Watch. Jon had hoped that perhaps his songs might persuade a few young men to take the black. Instead he sang of golden kisses, silvery hair, and red, red lips. No one ever took the black for red, red lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这也让他生气。戴利恩不该为妓女写歌。他应该歌唱长城和守夜人的英勇。琼恩期望他的歌或许能劝导一些年轻人穿上黑衣。结果他唱的却是金色的吻、银色的头发和火红的嘴唇。没有人会为了红唇而穿上黑衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked out the window once more, hoping against hope to see the singer hurrying home. Darkness was falling across the secret city, creeping through the alleys and down the canals. The good folk of Braavos would soon be shuttering their windows and sliding bars across their doors. Night belonged to the bravos and the courtesans. Dareon's new friends, Sam thought bitterly. They were all the singer could talk about of late. He was trying to write a song about one courtesan, a woman called the Moonshadow who had heard him singing beside the Moon Pool and rewarded him with a kiss. "You should have asked her for silver," Sam had said. "It's coin we need, not kisses." But the singer only smiled. "Some kisses are worth more than yellow gold, Slayer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再次抱着一线希望向窗外张望，希望看到歌手匆匆赶回家。黑暗正降临到秘之城，沿小巷和水渠蔓延。布拉佛斯善良的百姓纷纷关上窗户，拴上门闩。夜晚属于刺客和妓女。他们是戴利恩的新朋友，山姆苦涩地想，近来戴利恩谈论的只有他们。他正尝试写一首歌，献给一个叫月影的妓女，她在月池边听见他唱歌，便赠给他一个吻。“你应该问她要银币，”山姆说，“我们需要的是钱，不是亲吻。”但歌手只笑笑。“有些吻比黄金更值价，杀手。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes his playing would wake the babe too. Then the child would begin to wail, Dareon would shout at him to be quiet, Gilly would weep, and the singer would storm out and not return for days. "All that weeping makes me want to slap her," he complained, "and I can scarce sleep for her sobbing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时他的歌还会吵醒婴儿。孩子啼哭，戴利恩就冲他叫嚷，要他安静，而吉莉流泪，于是歌手气冲冲地离开，几天都不回来。“她老哭哭啼啼，我想给她几巴掌，”他抱怨，“她吵得我睡不着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You would weep as well if you had a son and lost him, Sam almost said. He could not blame Gilly for her grief. Instead, he blamed Jon Snow and wondered when Jon's heart had turned to stone. Once he asked Maester Aemon that very question, when Gilly was down at the canal fetching water for them. "When you raised him up to be the lord commander," the old man answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如你生下个儿子，又被活生生夺走，你也会哭的，山姆差点说出口。他无法责怪吉莉的悲伤，便转而责怪琼恩·雪诺，不知琼恩的心何时变成了石头。有一次，他趁吉莉去水渠打水时向伊蒙学士提出这个问题。“当你们把他选为总司令的时候。”老人回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even now, rotting here in this cold room beneath the eaves, part of Sam did not want to believe that Jon had done what Maester Aemon thought. It must be true, though. Why else would Gilly weep so much? All he had to do was ask her whose child she was nursing at her breast, but he did not have the courage. He was afraid of the answer he might get. I am still a craven, Jon. No matter where he went in this wide world, his fears went with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使现在，消极颓废地等在这间冷冰冰的屋子里，山姆心中仍不太愿意相信琼恩真的做了伊蒙学士说的事。可那一定是真的，否则吉莉怎会哭得如此厉害？他只需直接问她，抱在胸前吃奶的孩子究竟是谁的就行了，但他没有勇气。他害怕答案。我仍是个胆小鬼，琼恩。在这广阔的世界中，无论走到哪里，恐惧都与他如影随形。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because you're blind. Aemon's wits were wandering more and more since they arrived at Braavos. Some days he did not seem to know where he was. Some days he would lose his way when saying something and begin to ramble on about his father or his brother. He is one hundred and two, Sam reminded himself, but he had been just as old at Castle Black and his wits had never wandered there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为你瞎了。到达布拉佛斯之后，伊蒙神志不清的时间越来越长，有时他似乎不知道自己身在何处，说着说着就开始胡言乱语，唠唠叨叨地讲起他父亲或兄弟的事。他一百零二岁了，山姆提醒自己，但他在黑城堡时虽然年纪大，却从来没有神智不清。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No." Sam felt the old man's brow. His skin was damp with sweat, cool and clammy to the touch, his every breath a soft wheeze. "It's night, maester. You've been asleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”山姆摸摸老人的额头。他皮肤湿乎乎的，沾满汗水，又冷又黏，每一次呼吸都伴随着轻微的喘息。“现在是晚上，师傅，您刚才睡着了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A hollow rumbling echoed off the roofs of Braavos, like the sound of distant thunder; the Titan, sounding nightfall from across the lagoon. The noise was loud enough to wake the babe, and his sudden wail woke Maester Aemon. As Gilly went to give the boy the breast, the old man's eyes opened, and he stirred feebly in his narrow bed. "Egg? It's dark. Why is it so dark?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵空洞的隆隆声在布拉佛斯的屋顶上方回响，仿佛遥远的闷雷——这是礁湖对面泰坦巨人发出的，标志着夜晚到来。响动吵醒了婴儿，而他突然发出的啼哭又吵醒了伊蒙学士。吉莉把乳头塞给孩子，老人睁开眼睛，虚弱地在床上蠕动。“伊戈？好黑。为什么这么黑？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have no wood," Sam told him, "and the innkeep will not give us more unless we have the coin." It was the fourth or fifth time they'd had this same conversation. I should have used our coin for wood, Sam chided himself every time. I should have had the sense to keep him warm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们没有木头，”山姆告诉他，“店主人不肯再赊，除非立即付钱。”同样的对话已是第四或者第五遍了。我该拿钱买木头，山姆每次都责骂自己，我该给他取暖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead he had squandered the last of their silver on a healer from the House of the Red Hands, a tall pale man in robes embroidered with swirling stripes of red and white. All that the silver bought him was half a flask of dreamwine. "This may help gentle his passing," the Braavosi had said, not unkindly. When Sam asked if there wasn't any more that he could do, he shook his head. "Ointments I have, potions and infusions, tinctures and venoms and poultices. I might bleed him, purge him, leech him… but why? No leech can make him young again. This is an old man, and death is in his lungs. Give him this and let him sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而他把最后一点银币浪费在红手之院的医师身上，那是位肤色白皙的高大男子，穿着绣有红白相间旋涡花纹的长袍。从他那里，银币换来半瓶安眠酒。“有助于减轻他临终前的痛苦，”布拉佛斯人不无善意地说。山姆问他还可以做些什么，他摇摇头。“我有各种各样的药膏药水，也可以给他放血，清肠，使用水蛭疗法…但何必呢？水蛭无法让他年轻。他老了，死亡已侵入他的肺里面。给他这个，让他睡吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so he had, all night and all day, but now the old man was struggling to sit. "We must go down to the ships."</div>

<div class="line_en">The ships again. "You're too weak to go out," he had to say. A chill had gotten inside Maester Aemon during the voyage and settled in his chest. By the time they got to Braavos, he had been so weak they'd had to carry him ashore. They'd still had a fat bag of silver then, so Dareon had asked for the inn's biggest bed. The one they'd gotten was large enough to sleep eight, so the innkeep insisted on charging them for that many.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又是船。“你太虚弱，不能出去。”他不得不制止。航海途中，伊蒙学士着了风寒，等抵达布拉佛斯，他虚弱得需要被抬上岸。他们当时仍有满满一袋银子，于是戴利恩要了客栈里最大的床——那张床可以睡八个人，因此店主人坚持收八人份的钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"On the morrow we can go to the docks," Sam promised. "You can ask about and find which ship is departing next for Oldtown." Even in autumn, Braavos was still a busy port. Once Aemon was strong enough to travel, they should have no trouble finding a suitable vessel to take them where they had to go. Paying for their passage would prove more difficult. A ship from the Seven Kingdoms would be their best hope. A trader out of Oldtown, maybe, with kin in the Night's Watch. There must still be some who honor the men who walk the Wall. "Oldtown," Maester Aemon wheezed. "Yes. I dreamt of Oldtown, Sam. I was young again and my brother Egg was with me, with that big knight he served. We were drinking in the old inn where they make the fearsomely strong cider." He tried to rise again, but the effort proved too much for him. After a moment he settled back. "The ships," he said again. "We will find our answer there. About the dragons. I need to know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们明天就去码头，”山姆承诺，“到时候，您可以四处询问，寻找下一站去旧镇的船。”即使在秋天，布拉佛斯也是个繁忙的港口。一旦伊蒙的身体恢复到可以继续旅行，寻找一艘载他们去目的地的船并非难事。路费的问题则比较棘手。来自七国的船只最有希望。也许可以找一艘旧镇商船，船主的亲戚当过守夜人就好了。肯定有人仍对长城上的守卫抱持着敬意…旧镇，”伊蒙学士喘息着说。“是的，我梦到了旧镇，山姆。我又回到了年轻时候，跟弟弟伊戈在一起，还有他侍奉的大个子骑士。我们在老客栈里喝酒，浓烈的苹果酒。”他再次尝试坐起来，事实证明这对他来说太困难了。过了一会儿，他躺回去。“船，”他又说，“我们将在那边找到答案。关于龙。我需要了解。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once safe ashore, though, Sam had found himself ravenously hungry. It was the same for Dareon and Gilly. Even the babe had begun to suck more lustily. Aemon, though…</div>

<div class="line_en">"How will you get stronger unless you eat?" None of them had eaten much at sea, not after Skagos. The autumn gales had hounded them all across the narrow sea. Sometimes they came up from the south, roiling with thunder and lightning and black rains that fell for days. Sometimes they came down from the north, cold and grim, with savage winds that cut right through a man. Once it got so cold that Sam had woken to find the whole ship coated in ice, shining as white as pearl. The captain had taken down their mast and tied it to the deck, to finish the crossing on oars alone. No one had been eating by the time they saw the Titan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不吃怎么会好？”在海上谁都没吃多少东西，尤其过了斯卡格斯岛之后，穿越狭海途中，秋季风暴始终伴随。有时从南方来，夹带着滚雷和闪电，黑沉沉的雨一下就是好几天；有时来自北方，寒冷严酷，狂风仿佛能把人刺穿。有一回，山姆醒来时，发现整条船被冻上了一层冰壳，犹如洁白的珍珠，闪闪发光。船长将桅杆放下，系在甲板上，单凭划桨来完成渡海。等他们看见泰坦巨人时，已经没人吃得下东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The bread's gone stale, but I can beg some gravy from the kitchens to soak it in," Sam told the old man. The innkeep was a hard man, cold-eyed and suspicious of these black-clad strangers beneath his roof, but his cook was kinder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“面包不新鲜，我可以问厨房讨点肉汤来泡一泡。”山姆告诉老人。店主是个吝啬鬼，眼神冷漠，对自己屋檐下这群穿黑衣的陌生人心存怀疑，但他的厨师心肠比较好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不要。也许可以来一小口酒？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had no wine. Dareon had promised to buy some with the coin from his singing. "We'll have wine later," Sam had to say. "There's water, but it's not the good water." The good water came over the arches of the great brick aqueduct the Braavosi called the sweetwater river. Rich men had it piped into their homes; the poor filled their pails and buckets at public fountains. Sam had sent Gilly out to get some, forgetting that the wildling girl had lived her whole life in sight of Craster's Keep and never seen so much as a market town. The stony maze of islands and canals that was Braavos, devoid of grass and trees and teeming with strangers who spoke to her in words she could not understand, frightened her so badly that she lost the map and soon herself. Sam found her weeping at the stony feet of some long-dead sealord. "All we have is canal water," he told Maester Aemon, "but the cook gave it a boil. There's dreamwine too, if you need more of that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们没酒。戴利恩答应过用他唱歌得来的钱买一些。“我们会有酒的，”山姆不得不说，“现在只有水，虽然并非优质水。”优质水来自架空水渠，这些由砖块砌成的大水渠由桥弓支撑，布拉佛斯人称其为甜水渠。富人自把水引入家中，穷人则用桶子在公共喷泉池打水。山姆让吉莉去打水，却忘了野人女孩一生都生活在卡斯特堡垒的视线范围之内，连小镇都没见过，而布拉佛斯是一个布满岛屿和运河的石头迷宫，没草，没树，到处是陌生人，讲着她听不懂的语言。她吓坏了，把地图弄丢之后，很快自己也迷了路。被山姆发现时，她正在一座石像下哭泣，那雕像是某位死去多年的海王。“这是水渠里的水，”他告诉伊蒙学士，“但厨师把它煮开过。也有安眠酒，假如您还需要的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's no more wood." Dareon had paid the innkeep double for a room with a hearth, but none of them had realized that wood would be so costly here. Trees did not grow on Braavos, save in the courts and gardens of the mighty. Nor would the Braavosi cut the pines that covered the outlying islands around their great lagoon and acted as windbreaks to shield them from storms. Instead, firewood was brought in by barge, up the rivers and across the lagoon. Even dung was dear here; the Braavosi used boats in place of horses. None of that would have mattered if they had departed as planned for Oldtown, but that had proved impossible with Maester Aemon so weak. Another voyage on the open sea would kill him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没木头了。”戴利恩付给店主两倍价钱，要了一个带壁炉的房间，但谁也没意识到木头在这里会如此昂贵。除了权势人家的庭院，布拉佛斯不长树，这儿的人也不愿砍掉大礁湖外围岛屿上覆盖的松树，那是遮挡风暴的防风林。木柴都是由驳船从河流上游穿过礁湖运进来的。在这里，马粪都珍贵得紧，因为布拉佛斯人用小船代替马匹。本来他们若按计划起程去旧镇，这些都不成问题，但那实在是不可能。伊蒙学士如此虚弱，再次航行会要了他的命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When you are stronger." The old man was in no state to brave the salt spray and wet winds along the waterfront, and Braavos was all waterfront. To the north was the Purple Harbor, where Braavosi traders tied up beneath the domes and towers of the Sealord's Palace. To the west lay the Ragman's Harbor, crowded with ships from the other Free Cities, from Westeros and Ibben and the fabled, far-off lands of the east. And everywhere else were little piers and ferry berths and old grey wharves where shrimpers and crabbers and fisherfolk moored after working the mudflats and river mouths. "It would be too great a strain on you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Me?" Sam was dismayed by the suggestion. "Maester, it was only a story. A sailor's story." Dareon was to blame for this as well.

<div class="line_en">As a boy Sam had read a history of Braavos and dreamed of one day coming here. He wanted to behold the Titan rising stern and fearsome from the sea, glide down the canals in a serpent boat past all the palaces and temples, and watch the bravos do their water dance, blades flashing in the starlight. But now that he was here, all he wanted was to leave and go to Oldtown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆在孩提时代便读过布拉佛斯的历史，梦想有一天能来这里，看看大海中耸立的威严可怕的泰坦巨人，乘坐轻快的蛇舟沿运河游览宫殿和庙宇，观赏刺客的水舞，剑刃在星光下闪烁。现下他到了这里，却一心只想离开，一心只想平安抵达旧镇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gilly nodded, cradling the babe against her breast, her eyes welling full of tears. She is going to weep again, Sam realized. It was more than he could take. His swordbelt hung from a peg on the wall, beside the old cracked horn that Jon had given him. He ripped it down and buckled it about him, then swept his black wool cloak about his rounded shoulders, slumped through the door, and clattered down a wooden stair whose steps creaked beneath his weight. The inn had two front doors, one opening on a street and one on a canal. Sam went out through the former, to avoid the common room where the innkeep was sure to give him the sour eye that he reserved for guests who had overstayed their welcome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉莉抱着婴儿点点头，眼里盈满泪水。她又要哭了，山姆意识到，这超过了她所能忍受的极限。剑带挂在墙壁的栓子上，旁边是琼恩给他的古老的破号角。他摘下剑带扣到腰问，再将黑羊毛斗篷披到自己浑圆的肩膀上，弯腰穿过门洞，“噼噼啪啪”地走下木梯，楼梯在他的重压下呻吟。客栈有两个正门，一个面朝大街，另一个面向运河，店主此时多半在大厅，他不会给赊账太久、不受欢迎的客人好脸色看，于是山姆选择了面朝大街的门走出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a chill in the air, but the night was not half so foggy as some. Sam was grateful for that much. Sometimes the mists covered the ground so thick that a man could not see his own feet. Once he had come within a step of walking into a canal.</div>

<div class="line_en">With his hood up and his cloak flapping, he made his way along the cobblestones toward the Ragman's Harbor. His swordbelt kept threatening to fall down about his ankles, so he had to keep tugging it back up as he went. He stayed to the smaller, darker streets, where he was less likely to encounter anyone, yet every passing cat still made his heart thump… and Braavos crawled with cats. I need to find Dareon, he thought. He is a man of the Night's Watch, my Sworn Brother; he and I will puzzle out what to do. Maester Aemon's strength was gone, and Gilly would have been lost here even if she had not been grief-stricken, but Dareon… I should not think ill of him. He could be hurt, perhaps that is why he did not come back. He could be dead, lying in some alley in a pool of blood, or floating facedown in one of the canals. At night the bravos swaggered through the city in their parti-colored finery, spoiling to prove their skill with those slender swords they wore. Some would fight for any cause, some for none at all, and Dareon had a loose tongue and quick temper, especially when he'd been drinking. Just because a man can sing about battles doesn't mean he's fit to fight one.</div>

<div class="line_en">The best alehouses, inns, and brothels were near the Purple Harbor or the Moon Pool, but Dareon preferred the Ragman's Harbor, where the patrons were more apt to speak the Common Tongue. Sam began his search at the Inn of the Green Eel, the Black Bargeman, and Moroggo's, places where Dareon had played before. He was not to be found at any of them. Outside the Foghouse several serpent boats were tied up awaiting patrons, and Sam tried to ask the polemen if they had seen a singer all in black, but none of the polemen understood his High Valyrian. That, or they do not chose to understand. Sam peered into the dingy winesink beneath the second arch of Nabbo's Bridge, barely large enough to accommodate ten people. Dareon was not one of them. He tried the Outcast Inn, the House of Seven Lamps, and the brothel called the Cattery, where he got strange looks but no help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然最好的酒馆、客栈和妓院都在紫港与月池附近，戴利恩却更喜欢旧衣贩码头，因为那儿的顾客会讲通用语的比较多。山姆沿绿鳗客栈、黑船工、摩洛戈一家家找下去，戴利恩曾在这些地方表演。一无所获。雾宅外泊着几条等客的蛇舟，山姆试图询问那些撑船手，有没见过黑衣歌手，但无人听得懂他的高等瓦雷利亚语。可能他们装作听不懂。纳波桥的第二个桥拱下有间肮脏的小酒馆，最多只能容纳十人，山姆朝内张望了一下。戴利恩不在。他又去了放逐者旅馆、七灯之院及一家叫猫舍的妓院，仍然没头绪，得到的只有怪异的凝视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leaving, he almost bumped into two young men beneath the Cattery's red lantern. One was dark and one was fair. The dark-haired one said something in Braavosi. "I am sorry," Sam had to say. "I do not understand." He edged away from them, afraid. In the Seven Kingdoms nobles draped themselves in velvets, silks, and samites of a hundred hues whilst peasants and smallfolk wore raw wool and dull brown roughspun. In Braavos it was otherwise. The bravos swaggered about like peacocks, fingering their swords, whilst the mighty dressed in charcoal grey and purple, blues that were almost black and blacks as dark as a moonless night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他离开猫舍时差点在红灯笼下撞上两个年轻人，一个黑发，一个金发。黑头发那个用布拉佛斯语说了些什么。“对不起，”山姆不得不赔礼道歉，“我听不懂。”在七大王国，贵族们身披色彩缤纷的天鹅绒、锦绣与绸缎，农民和普通百姓则穿原色羊毛布或暗褐色粗纺布。布拉佛斯正相反。刺客们打扮得像孔雀一样招摇过市，把玩着手中的剑，而有权势的人要么选择接近黑色的深灰、深紫或深蓝，要么直接穿黑衣服，黑得好像没有月亮的夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>

The other one, the dark-haired bravo in the burgundy brocade and yellow cloak whose name would appear to have been Terro, made some comment in Braavosi, and his fair-haired friend laughed, and said, "My friend Terro says you dress above your station.

"There's another one down at the Happy Port, singing songs to the Sailor's Wife," she informed the two bravos.

What few people he encountered gave him curious looks, and once a cat reared up and hissed at him. By the time he reached the ship he was staggering. The Happy Port was just across the alley.</div>

<div class="line_en">No sooner had he entered, flushed and out of breath, than a one-eyed woman threw her arms around his neck. "Don't," Sam told her, "I'm not here for that." She answered in Braavosi. "I do not speak that tongue," Sam said in High Valyrian. There were candles burning and a fire crackling in the hearth. Someone was sawing on a fiddle, and he saw two girls dancing around a red priest, holding hands. The one-eyed woman pressed her breasts against his chest. "Don't do that! I'm not here for that!"</div>

One of the dancers called out, "He can slay me if he likes," and the other said, "Do you think he'd let me touch his sword?" Behind them a purple galleas had been painted on the wall, crewed by women clad in thigh-high boots and nothing else. A Tyroshi sailor was passed out in a corner, snoring into his huge scarlet beard. Elsewhere an older woman with huge breasts was turning tiles with a massive Summer Islander in black-and-scarlet feathers. In the center of it all sat Dareon, nuzzling at the neck of the woman in his lap. She was wearing his black cloak.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not think about it. His hand came up, curled into a fist, and crashed into the singer's mouth. Dareon cursed and his naked wife gave a shriek and Sam threw himself onto the singer and knocked him backwards over a low table. They were almost of a height, but Sam weighed twice as much, and for once he was too angry to be afraid. He punched the singer in the face and in the belly, then began to pummel him about the shoulders with both hands. When Dareon grabbed his wrists, Sam butted him with his head and broke his lip. The singer let go and he smashed him in the nose. Somewhere a man was laughing, a woman cursing. The fight seemed to slow, as if they were two black flies struggling in amber.

I'm upside down, he realized, I'm drowning. Something moved beneath one flailing hand, an eel or a fish, slithering through his fingers.
