<div class="line_en">"Nice loud howl, Harry -- exactly -- and then, if you'll believe it, I pounced -- like this -- slammed him to the floor -- thus -- with one hand, I managed to hold him down -- with my other, I put my wand to his throat -- I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm -- he let out a piteous moan -- go on, Harry -- higher than that -- good -- the fur vanished -- the fangs shrank -- and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective -- and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks."</div>

<div class="line_en">Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.</div>

I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces.

<div class="line_en">Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏小心翼翼地打开《强力药剂》，三个人都凑上前，看着那些布满水印的纸页。他们一眼就看出这本书为什么属于禁书区了。里面的有些药剂的效果可怕极了，简直令人不敢想象，书里还有一些让人看了感到很不舒服的插图：一个人似乎被从里到外翻了出来，还有一个巫婆脑袋上冒出了许多双手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here it is," said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.</div>

<div class="line_en">Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle's out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron's objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟后，他们又一次躲在了哭泣的桃金娘失修的盥洗室里。赫敏驳回了罗恩的反对意见，指出只要头脑正常的人，都不会愿意到这里来，这样他们三个就保证不会被人发现了。哭泣的桃金娘在她的单间里放声大哭，他们不理她，她也不理他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass," she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. "Well, they're easy enough, they're in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves… Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn -- don't know where we're going to get that -- shredded skin of a boomslang -- that'll be tricky, too -- and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into."</div>

He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly.
