<div class="line_en">"Truly?" said the Halfmaester. "Never. You swallowed half the river. You may be going grey even now, turning to stone from inside out, starting with your heart and lungs. If so, pricking your toes and bathing in vinegar will not save you. When you're done, come have some broth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说真的？”半学士说。“永不。你吞掉了半条河，现在你也许正在转变，从内部变成石头，从你的心肺开始。若是这样的话，扎扎你的脚趾或者用醋淋身一点儿用都没。若你真是这样，就来喝点汤吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The broth was good, though Tyrion noted that the Halfmaester kept the table between them as he ate. The Shy Maid was moored to a weathered pier on the east bank of the Rhoyne. Two piers down, a Volantene river galley was discharging soldiers. Shops and stalls and storehouses huddled beneath a sandstone wall. The towers and domes of the city were visible beyond it, reddened by the light of the setting sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤是不错，提利昂想，他注意到半学士在他喝的时候横了一张桌子在他们之间。害羞小姐号已经飘到了罗伊达西岸的一个风化的码头旁。再过两个码头，有艘瓦兰提斯河舰正在卸下士兵们。商店摊棚还有仓库在一座沙石墙下挤作一团，城邦的塔楼和圆顶则耸立在它们身后，被夕阳染成红色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have been telling all the women that for years." Tyrion drove the dagger's point into the ball of his thumb, watched the blood bead up, sucked it away. "How long must I continue to torture myself? When will we be certain that I'm clean?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多年来我一直都这么对那些女人说。”提利昂用匕首的尖端挑进他的拇指，看着血滴冒出接着吮吸了一下。“我得这样折磨自己到猴年马月？什么时候我才能确定我没事儿了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Young Griff's greeting was less effusive. The princeling was in a sullen mood, angry that he had been forced to remain on the Shy Maid instead of going ashore with Yandry and Ysilla. "We only want to keep you safe," Lemore told him. "These are unsettled times."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小格里夫的问候就没那么多感情了，年轻的王子闷闷不乐，依旧对杨恩德里和伊西拉能上岸而他不得不留在船上而生气。“我们只是为你的安全着想，”莱莫尔这样劝慰。“现在时局不稳。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="至少你祈祷了。“我对你没什么意见。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haldon Halfmaester explained. "On the way down from the Sorrows to Selhorys, we thrice glimpsed riders moving south along the river's eastern shore. Dothraki. Once they were so close we could hear the bells tinkling in their braids, and sometimes at night their fires could be seen beyond the eastern hills. We passed warships as well, Volantene river galleys crammed with slave soldiers. The triarchs fear an attack upon Selhorys, plainly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半学士哈尔顿解释道。“在伤心地到赛尔霍利斯之间这段路，我们三次瞥河东岸有向南进军的骑手——多斯拉克人。又一次我们是如此的靠近，甚至能听到他们发辫上的铃声，夜晚不时还能看到他们的营火在东山后面照耀。我们也遇见了战舰，挤满了奴隶士兵的瓦伦提斯河舰。元老们显然在担心来自赛尔霍利斯方向的攻击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion understood that quick enough. Alone amongst the major river towns, Selhorys stood upon the eastern bank of the Rhoyne, making it much more vulnerable to the horselords than its sister towns across the river. Even so, it is a small prize. If I were khal, I would feint at Selhorys, let the Volantenes rush to defend it, then swing south and ride hard for Volantis itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂立即明白过来。沿着主河道的城镇里，赛尔罗伊斯坐落于罗伊达的东岸，与它的姊妹们相比，她更容易收到来自马王们的袭击。即使这样，着也是一个小小的奖赏。若我是卡奥，我就会佯攻赛尔霍利斯，让瓦兰提斯人赶来营救，然后向南暗度陈仓直取瓦兰提斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Even the bravest of your forebears kept his Kingsguard close about him in times of peril." Lemore had changed out of her septa's robes into garb more befitting the wife or daughter of a prosperous merchant. Tyrion watched her closely. He had sniffed out the truth beneath the dyed blue hair of Griff and Young Griff easily enough, and Yandry and Ysilla seemed to be no more than they claimed to be, whilst Duck was somewhat less. Lemore, though… Who is she, really? Why is she here? Not for gold, I'd judge. What is this prince to her? Was she ever a true septa?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就算你祖先里最勇猛的人也知道危险的时候不离铁卫。”莱莫尔已经换下了她的修女袍，穿上一身更类似于富商妻女的衣服。提利昂仔细地观察着她。虽然他能轻而易举地嗅出染着蓝发的格里夫和小格里夫背后的真相，杨恩德里和伊西拉看起来也就是他们说的那样，而鸭子也差不多。但是莱莫尔…她又是谁？她在这里干什么？我猜，不是为了钱。这个王子对他来说又是什么地位？她又是不是个真正的修女？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dwarf shrugged. "I know that she spent her childhood in exile, impoverished, living on dreams and schemes, running from one city to the next, always fearful, never safe, friendless but for a brother who was by all accounts half-mad… a brother who sold her maidenhood to the Dothraki for the promise of an army. I know that somewhere out upon the grass her dragons hatched, and so did she. I know she is proud. How not? What else was left her but pride? I know she is strong. How not? The Dothraki despise weakness. If Daenerys had been weak, she would have perished with Viserys. I know she is fierce. Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen are proof enough of that. She has crossed the grasslands and the red waste, survived assassins and conspiracies and fell sorceries, grieved for a brother and a husband and a son, trod the cities of the slavers to dust beneath her dainty sandaled feet. Now, how do you suppose this queen will react when you turn up with your begging bowl in hand and say, 'Good morrow to you, Auntie. I am your nephew, Aegon, returned from the dead. I've been hiding on a poleboat all my life, but now I've washed the blue dye from my hair and I'd like a dragon, please… and oh, did I mention, my claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than your own?'"</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the tigers spied the dwarf and said something that made the others laugh. As they reached the gate, he pulled off his clawed gauntlet and the sweaty glove beneath, locked one arm around the dwarf's neck, and roughly rubbed his head. Tyrion was too startled to resist. It was all over in a heartbeat. "Was there some reason for that?" he demanded of the Halfmaester.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一个虎兵看见了提利昂说了些什么引的其他人一起大笑起来。当他们到达大门时，他拉起自己的带爪护手和里面汗津津的手套，用一只胳膊钳住侏儒的脖子，同时狠狠的揉着他的脑袋。提利昂吓的不敢抵抗，幸好他仅仅是被吓了一跳。“刚才那是怎么回事？”他询问“半学士”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A great square opened up before them. Even at this hour, it was crowded and noisy and ablaze with light. Lanterns swung from iron chains above the doors of inns and pleasure houses, but within the gates, they were made of colored glass, not parchment. To their right a nightfire burned outside a temple of red stone. A priest in scarlet robes stood on the temple balcony, haranguing the small crowd that had gathered around the flames. Elsewhere, travelers sat playing cyvasse in front of an inn, drunken soldiers wandered in and out of what was obviously a brothel, a woman beat a mule outside a stable. A two-wheeled cart went rumbling past them, pulled by a white dwarf elephant. This is another world, thought Tyrion, but not so different from the world I know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个开阔的广场在他们面前展开。即使这么晚了它依旧拥挤吵闹到处是火光。旅社和妓院门上都用铁链悬挂着摇晃的灯笼，但是到了门内就是五彩的玻璃而非羊皮灯笼了。他们右侧红石建造的庙宇外夜火熊熊燃烧。一个身着血红袍子的神僧对着围坐在火光边的一些人高声布道。别处，旅行者坐在旅社外面玩锡瓦斯棋，醉酒的士兵在显然是个妓院的房子外游荡，一个女人在马厩外鞭打一头骡子。一辆双轮马车由一头白色矮象拉着吱呀着从他们旁边驶过。这是个另一个世界，提利昂想，但是和我所知的那个也没太大不同。">查看中文翻译</div>

They guard our walls, row our galleys, fight our battles. And now when they look east, they see this young queen shining from afar, this breaker of chains. The Old Blood cannot suffer that.

<div class="line_en">"You have Dothraki outside your own gates," Haldon said. "Khal Pono." Qavo waved a pale hand in dismissal. "The horselords come, we give them gifts, the horselords go." He moved his catapult again, closed his hand around Tyrion's alabaster dragon, removed it from the board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们自己门外就有多斯拉克人在虎视眈眈，”哈尔顿说。“波诺卡奥。”Qavo挥了挥苍白的手表示抗议。“若马王们来，我们赠予他们礼物，他们就会走开。”他再次移动他的投石机，攥住提利昂的大理石龙，吃掉了它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest was slaughter, though the dwarf held on another dozen moves. "The time has come for bitter tears," Qavo said at last, scooping up the pile of silver. "Another game?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Three," Qavo allowed, "against thrice three thousand enemies. Grazdan mo Eraz was not the only envoy sent out from the Yellow City. When the Wise Masters move against Meereen, the legions of New Ghis will fight beside them. Tolosi. Elyrians. Even the Dothraki."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“三只，”Qavo沉吟，“对抗三倍于三千的敌人。Grazdan mo Eraz不是‘黄城’排除的唯一使节，当‘智者’与弥林对立时，新吉斯的军团会与他们并肩作战，还有Tolosi，伊利里安人甚至多斯拉克人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside in the square, the nightfire was still burning, but the priest was gone and the crowd was long dispersed. The glow of candles glimmered from the windows of the brothel. From inside came the sound of women's laughter. "The night is still young," said Tyrion. "Qavo may not have told us everything. And whores hear much and more from the men they service."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="广场之外，夜火依旧燃烧，但是神僧已经不在于是人群业已散开。妓院窗口透出红烛闪烁的火焰，从里面传出阵阵女子的笑声。“夜还早，”提利昂说。“Qavo大概没倾其所知，妓女们从欢客那里得到的要多得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The brothel was a modest one compared to those the dwarf had been wont to frequent in Lannisport and King's Landing. The proprietor did not seem to speak any tongue but that of Volantis, but he understood the clank of silver well enough and led Tyrion through an archway into a long room that smelled of incense, where four bored slave girls were lounging about in various states of undress. Two had seen at least forty namedays come and go, he guessed; the youngest was perhaps fifteen or sixteen. None was as hideous as the whores he'd seen working the docks, though they fell well short of beauty. One was plainly pregnant. Another was just fat, and sported iron rings in both her nipples. All four had tears tattooed beneath one eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个妓院和侏儒在兰尼斯特港和君临逛过的相比算是中规中矩。老鸨（男人可以叫老鸨么）似乎除了瓦兰提斯语外什么话都不会，但是金币碰撞的声音他显然了然于心带着提利昂穿过走廊进入一长条焚香的房间，在那四个百无聊赖的奴隶女孩摆着各种各样的半裸姿态。他猜其中两个至少40岁了，最年幼的那个大概十五六岁，但是没一个像他在码头看到的那么丑，但是也不是那么美貌。其中一人显然怀孕了，另一个胖的玩弄着乳环。四人的一只眼下都有眼泪刺青。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, have no fear on that count. Most women prefer to be done with me as quickly as they can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，别担心那事儿了，多数女人都巴不得快点和我完事儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Halfmaester laughed. "I will wait for you in the tavern by the gate. Do not be too long about your business."</div>

<div class="line_en">"A man grows weary of having no lovers but his fingers." Selhorys may be where whores go. Tysha might be in there even now, with tears tattooed upon her cheek. "I almost drowned.

<div class="line_en">"Do you have a girl who speaks the tongue of Westeros?" asked Tyrion. The proprietor squinted, uncomprehending, so he repeated the question in High Valyrian. This time the man seemed to grasp a word or three and replied in Volantene. "Sunset girl" was all the dwarf could get out of his answer. He took that to mean a girl from the Sunset Kingdoms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你又那个女孩说维斯特洛伊语么？”提利昂问。老鸨困惑不解得乜了他一眼，所以他用高等瓦雷利亚语重复了一遍。这次男人听懂了几个词于是用瓦兰提斯语回答。“日落女孩”是侏儒从他的话里仅能听懂的词。他认为那意思是一个来自日落帝国的女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was only one such in the house, and she was not Tysha. She had freckled cheeks and tight red curls upon her head, which gave promise of freckled breasts and red hair between her legs. "She'll do," said Tyrion, "and I'll have a flagon too. Red wine with red flesh." The whore was looking at his noseless face with revulsion in her eyes. "Do I offend you, sweet-ling? I am an offensive creature, as my father would be glad to tell you if he were not dead and rotting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这里只有一个女孩符合要求，而她显然不是泰莎。她是个满脸雀斑火红卷发的女孩，所以她的胸脯和胯间也是如此。“她就好，”提利昂说，“我还要一壶酒，红酒配红肉。”女孩看着他的半个鼻子毫不掩饰她的反感。“我冒犯你了么，小甜甜？我可不是个讨厌的家伙啊，就像我父亲会很高兴的告诉你的那样，当然前提是他没死掉发臭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though she did look Westerosi, the girl spoke not a word of the Common Tongue. Perhaps she was captured by some slaver as a child. Her bedchamber was small, but there was a Myrish carpet on the floor and a mattress stuffed with feathers in place of straw. I have seen worse. "Will you give me your name?" he asked, as he took a cup of wine from her. "No?" The wine was strong and sour and required no translation. "I suppose I shall settle for your cunt." He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "Have you ever bedded a monster before? Now's as good a time as any. Out of your clothes and onto your back, if it please you. Or not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然这个女孩看起来是个维斯特洛伊人，但是她不说一句通用语。也许她早在孩童时期就被奴隶贩子捉来。她的卧房很小，但是有密尔地毯铺地还有塞满羽毛而非稻草的床垫。我见过更糟糕的。“可以告诉我您的芳名么？”从她手中接过一杯红酒时他问。“不？”红酒毫无疑问又烈又酸。“看来我得向你的蜜穴进军了。”他用手背擦了擦嘴。“你以前和怪物睡过吗？现在你会像以前一样享受的。脱了衣服去躺着，无论你愿不愿意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He needed wine. A lot of wine. He seized the flagon with both hands and raised it to his lips. The wine ran red. Down his throat, down his chin. It dripped from his beard and soaked the feather bed. In the candlelight it looked as dark as the wine that had poisoned Joffrey. When he was done he tossed the empty flagon aside and half-rolled and half-staggered to the floor, groping for a chamber pot. There was none to be found. His stomach heaved, and he found himself on his knees, retching on the carpet, that wonderful thick Myrish carpet, as comforting as lies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他需要一杯葡萄酒，很多葡萄酒。他双手抓住酒壶贴上嘴。葡萄酒的红汁从他的喉咙倾泻而下淌满了他的下巴，从他的胡子上滴下染红了羽毛床单。在昏暗的烛光下看起来就像毒死了乔佛里的那杯酒。当他灌完后他扔开空酒壶蹒跚蜷曲地爬到地上，摸索着尿壶。但是他什么也没找到。胃里一阵翻腾，他发现自己正跪在地毯上干呕，这个厚厚的密尔地毯躺着也很舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked at him uncomprehending, until he took the flagon from her hands and lifted her skirts up over her head. After that she understood what was required of her, though she did not prove the liveliest of partners. Tyrion had been so long without a woman that he spent himself inside her on the third thrust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不解的看着他，直到她拿走她手里的酒壶将她的裙子掀过头顶。之后她才知道等着她的是什么，但是她无须证明她的恩客的狂野。提利昂好久没亲近女人了所以这次他连做了三次。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rolled off feeling more ashamed than sated. This was a mistake. What a wretched creature I've become. "Do you know a woman by the name of Tysha?" he asked, as he watched his seed dribble out of her onto the bed. The whore did not respond. "Do you know where whores go?" She did not answer that one either. Her back was crisscrossed by ridges of scar tissue. This girl is as good as dead. I have just fucked a corpse. Even her eyes looked dead. She does not even have the strength to loathe me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不断涌现出羞愧的感觉远胜满足。这是个错误。我变成了个怎样讨厌的家伙啊。“你认识一个叫泰莎的女人么？”他问，看着他的种子从她体内流到床上。妓女没吱声。“你知道妓女的去处么？”她依旧沉默。她的悲伤划满了突起的伤疤。这个女孩和死了差不多。我刚刚操了具尸体。就连她的眼睛也死寂一片。她连厌恶我的力量都没了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The whore cried out in distress. They will blame her for this, he realized, ashamed. "Cut off my head and take it to King's Landing," Tyrion urged her. "My sister will make a lady of you, and no one will ever whip you again." She did not understand that either, so he shoved her legs apart, crawled between them, and took her once more. That much she could comprehend, at least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妓女痛苦的大喊。他知道他们会为此惩罚她的，真遗憾。“把我脑袋砍下来带去君临，”提利昂敦促她。“我亲爱的老姐会让为你封爵一样看待，没人再会鞭打你了。”她也听不懂这个，所以他再次打开她的双腿，爬上去又操了她一次。这下她总该领会了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Afterward the wine was done and so was he, so he wadded up the girl's clothing and tossed it at the door. She took the hint and fled, leaving him alone in the darkness, sinking deeper into his feather bed. I am stinking drunk. He dare not close his eyes, for fear of sleep. Beyond the veil of dream, the Sorrows were waiting for him. Stone steps ascending endlessly, steep and slick and treacherous, and somewhere at the top, the Shrouded Lord. I do not want to meet the Shrouded Lord. Tyrion fumbled back into his clothes again and groped his way to the stair. Griff will flay me. Well, why not? If ever a dwarf deserved a skinning, I'm him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后酒喝光了就像他也完事儿了一样，所以他卷起女孩的遗物扔到门口，于是她意会得溜走了，把他一人留在黑暗中，在羽毛床中沉沦。搞得烂醉，他不敢合上眼担心睡着。在睡梦的遮盖外，伤心地在等待着他。石阶向上无尽的延伸，又陡又滑还不稳，在顶上的某处裹尸布神在那儿等待。我不想见到裹尸布神。提利昂再次摸索着他的衣物并跌撞的回到楼梯。格里夫会狠狠斥责我的。好吧，为什么不呢？若一个侏儒理当剥皮的话，那就是我了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Halfway down the steps, he lost his footing. Somehow he managed to break his tumble with his hands and turn it into a clumsy thumping cartwheel. The whores in the room below looked up in astonishment when he landed at the foot of the steps. Tyrion rolled onto his feet and gave them a bow. "I am more agile when I'm drunk." He turned to the proprietor. "I fear I ruined your carpet. The girl's not to blame. Let me pay." He pulled out a fistful of coins and tossed them at the man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在走到楼梯一半的时候，他失足了。但好在他用手阻止了翻滚变成了笨拙的滑跌。当他滚落到楼梯最下层时房间里的妓女们都惊奇的看着他。“我在醉酒的时候更灵活。”他转向老鸨。“我想我糟蹋了你的地毯。别责罚那女孩儿了，我会赔偿的。”他掏出一把钱币抛给了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the corner of the room, a man sat in a pool of shadow, with a whore squirming on his lap. I never saw that girl. If I had, I would have taken her upstairs instead of freckles. She was younger than the others, slim and pretty, with long silvery hair. Lyseni, at a guess… but the man whose lap she filled was from the Seven Kingdoms. Burly and broad-shouldered, forty if he was a day, and maybe older. Half his head was bald, but coarse stubble covered his cheeks and chin, and hair grew thickly down his arms, sprouting even from his knuckles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在房间角落，有个男人抱着膝上的妓女隐蔽在阴影里。我刚才没看到那个女孩，若是看到了我一定把她弄到手而不是刚才那个满脸雀斑的。她比其他的女孩都年轻、苗条、美丽，有着长长的银发。猜她是里斯人…但是那个那个她坐在上面的男人是来自七大王国。魁梧宽肩，白天里看的话应该是40岁左右，也许还要年长点。他的头已经半秃，但是粗糙的胡茬布满他的脸颊和下巴，臂毛也很浓密，连关节处都有长。">查看中文翻译</div>
