<div class="line_en">Jack awoke from a thin and uneasy sleep where huge and ill-defined shapes chased him through endless snowfields to what he first thought was another dream: darkness, and in it, a sudden mechanical jumble of noises-clicks and clanks, hummings, rattlings, snaps and whooshes.</div>

There was a grating, screeching sound as the elevator car came to an instant standstill. For a moment the declutched motor in the basement whined even louder, and then its circuit breaker cut in and the Overlook went unearthly still. The night wind outside seemed very loud by comparison. Jack looked stupidly at the gray metal elevator door. There were three splotches of blood below the keyhole from his lacerated knuckles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电梯缆索不见了，电梯底部进入了小窗户的视域中。过了一秒钟，杰克用力转动钥匙。电梯立即停了下来，发出了尖利刺耳的嘎吱声。地下室里与离合器分开了的发动机轰鸣了一会儿便停息了，远望饭店陷入了一片幽寂之中。相比之下，楼外夜风的呜咽声更响了。杰克怔怔地盯着灰色的金属电梯门。他割破的指节在钥匙孔下面的地板上滴上了三片血斑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wendy!" he shouted. But she had already caught the car's bottom edge and pulled herself up enough so she could look in. Then, with a convulsive heave of her shoulder and belly muscles, she tried to boost herself all the way up. For a moment the issue was in doubt. Her feet tottered over the blackness of the shaft and one pink slipper fell from her foot and slipped out of sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“温迪！”他喊道。但她已经抓住了电梯地板的边缘，往上拉得能看见里面，然后她肩部和腹部肌肉猛地一收，想把自己推上去。片刻之间，这个问题似乎打上了问号。她的脚在黑洞洞的电梯井中蹬弹了几下，一只粉红的拖鞋从她脚上掉下去，转瞬间便无踪无影了。">查看中文翻译</div>
