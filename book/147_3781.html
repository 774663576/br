<div class="line_en">It was the winter, and the sullen dying autumn that he hated most at Dixieland -- the dim fly-specked lights, the wretched progress about the house in search of warmth, Eliza untidily wrapped in an old sweater, a dirty muffler, a cast-off man's coat. She glycerined her cold-cracked hands. The chill walls festered with damp: they drank in death from the atmosphere: a woman died of typhoid, her husband came quickly out into the hall and dropped his hands. They were Ohio people.</div>

<div class="line_en">He liked the summers better. There came slow-bodied women from the hot rich South, dark-haired white-bodied girls from New Orleans, corn-haired blondes from Georgia, nigger-drawling desire from South Carolina. And there was malarial lassitude, tinged faintly with yellow, from Mississippi but with white biting teeth. A red-faced South Carolinian, with nicotined fingers, took him daily to the baseball games; a lank yellow planter, malarial from Mississippi, climbed hill, and wandered through the fragrant mountain valleys with him; of nights he heard the rich laughter of the women, tender and cruel, upon the dark porches, heard the florid throat-tones of the men; saw the yielding stealthy harlotry of the South -- the dark seclusion of their midnight bodies, their morning innocence. Desire, with bloody beak, tore at his heart like jealous virtue: he was moral for that which was denied him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Jew was a kind man. He coughed gently behind his white hand and ate bread fried in battered egg and butter. Eugene developed a keen appetite for it: innocently he called it "Jew Bread" and asked for more. Lichenfels laughed gently, coughed -- his wife was full of swart rich laughter. The boy did small services for him: he gave him a coin from week to week. He was a clothier from a New Jersey town. In the Spring he went to a sanitarium; he died there later.</div>

<div class="line_en">His trust in her Gantian wealth was boundless: this rich store of delight came from inexhaustible resources. Warm lively hens cackled cheerfully throughout the morning neighborhood; powerful negroes brought dripping ice in iron talons from their smoking wagons; he stood beneath their droning saws and caught the flying ice-pulp in his hands; he drank in the combined odor of their great bodies together with the rich compost of the refrigeration, and the sharp oiliness of the dining-room linoleum; and in the horsehair walnut parlor at mid-day, good with the mellow piano-smell and the smell of stale varnished wood, she played for him, and made him sing: "William Tell," "My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice," "The Song Without Words," "Celeste Aïda," "The Lost Chord," her long throat lean and tendoned as her vibrant voice rang out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他姐姐海伦主持家政，每顿饭都会有各种丰富的食品，他深信甘特家的财富是取之不尽的：这种令人开心的丰富储备来自众多源泉。每天清晨一大早，就会从附近传来母鸡咯咯的欢叫声，身强力壮的黑人会用铁钳子把滴着水的大冰块从冒烟的汽车上取下来，他就站在锯冰的架子下面，用手接着四处飞溅的碎冰屑。他闻着黑人身上的体臭，夹杂着冷藏堆肥的霉臭味，饭厅油布上的油腻味；中午的时候，在摆放胡桃木家具的客厅里，他闻到了旧家具散发出的陈年油漆味，听到了柔和的钢琴声。姐姐一边弹奏，一边教他唱《威廉泰尔之歌》、《甜美歌声动心弦》《无言的歌》《塞里斯蒂·艾达》《消失的情丝》。当她唱到颤音的时候，便会把细长的脖子伸得老长老长，圆润的嗓音非常悦耳动听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of mornings he stayed at Gant's with Helen playing ball with Buster Isaacs, a cousin of Max, a plump jolly little boy who lived next door; summoned later by the rich incense of Helen's boiling fudge. She sent him to the little Jewish grocery down the street for the sour relishes she liked so well: tabled in mid-morning they ate sour pickles, heavy slabs of ripe tomatoes, coated with thick mayonnaise, amber percolated coffee, fig-newtons and ladyfingers, hot pungent fudge pebbled with walnuts and coated fragrantly with butter, sandwiches of tender bacon and cucumber, iced belchy soft-drinks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, frantic with some swift tangle of her nerves, she would attack him viciously, hating him for his dark brooding face, his full scalloped underlip, his deep absorption in a dream. Like Luke, and like Gant, she sought in the world ceaseless entertainment for her restless biting vitality; it infuriated her to see other people seek absorption within themselves -- she hated him at times when, her own wires strumming, she saw his dark face brooding over a book or on some vision. She would tear the book from his hands, slap him, and stab him with her cruel savage tongue. She would pout out her lip, goggle her face about stupidly on a drooping neck, assume an expression of dopey idiocy, and pour out on him the horrible torrent of her venom.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not mind the physical assault so much as he did the poisonous hatred of her tongue, insanely clever in fashioning the most wounding barbs.

He rushed at the wall like an insane little goat, battered his head screaming again and again, wished desperately that his constricted and overloaded heart would burst, that something in him would break, that somehow, bloodily, he might escape the stifling prisonhouse of his life.</div>

Yet she was at heart a severely conventional person, in spite of her occasional vulgarity, which was merely a manifestation of her restless energy, a very naïve, a childishly innocent person about even the simple wickedness of the village. She had several devoted young men on her list -- plain, hard-drinking country types: one, a native, lean, red-faced, alcoholic, a city surveyor, who adored her; another, a strapping florid blond from the Tennessee coal fields; another, a young South Carolinian, townsman of her older sister's fiancé.</div>

She was the trusted, accurate, infallible bookkeeper of a grocery store. She contributed largely to the support of her family -- a mother whom Eugene looked upon with sick flesh, because of the heavy goitre that sagged from her loose neck; a crippled sister who moved about the house by means of crutches and the propulsive strength of her powerful shoulders; and two brothers, hulking young thugs of twenty and eighteen years, who always bore upon their charmed bodies fresh knife-wounds, blue lumps and swellings, and other marks of their fights in poolroom and brothel. They lived in a two-story shack of rickety lumber on Clingman Street: the women worked uncomplainingly in the support of the young men.

<div class="line_en">When Mrs. Selborne first came to Dixieland from the hot South she was only twenty-three but she looked older. Ripeness with her was all: she was a tall heavy-bodied blonde, well kept and elegant. She moved leisurely with a luxurious sensual swing of the body: her smile was tender and full of vague allurement, her voice gentle, her sudden laughter, bubbling out of midnight secrecy, rich and full. She was one of several handsome and bacchic daughters of a depleted South Carolinian of good family; she had married at sixteen a red heavy man who came and went from her incomparable table, eating rapidly and heartily, muttering, when pressed, a few shy-sullen words, and departing to the closed leather-and-horse smell of his little office in the livery-stable he owned. She had two children by him, both girls: she moved with wasted stealth around all the quiet slander of a South Carolina mill-town, committing adultery carefully with a mill owner, a banker, and a lumber man, walking circumspectly with her tender blonde smile by day past all the sly smiles of town and trade, knowing that the earth was mined below her feet, and that her name, with clerk and merchant, was a sign for secret laughter. The natives, the men in particular, treated her with even more elaborate respect than a woman is usually given in a Southern town, but their eyes, behind the courteous unctions of their masks, were shiny with invitation.</div>

Eugene had a feeling of disgust and horror whenever his oldest brother returned: he knew that those who were physically least able to defend themselves, which included Eliza and himself, would bear the brunt of his whining, petty bullying, and drunken obscenity.

Later, the confusion, the greetings, the hysteria of the women. Daisy sobbing uncontrollably in the arms of a distant cousin, Beth Pentland, who had come up with her hearty red husband, the owner of a chain of small groceries in a South Carolina town, bringing gifts and a giant watermelon, and whose own grief was enhanced by the discovery, after the wedding, that the dress she had worked on weeks in advance she had put on, in her frenzy, wrong side out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金的脑海里还能回忆起这次操办婚礼的热闹场面来。他们都忙着制作新衣服，排练婚礼的仪式，黛西紧张得几乎有些歇斯底里。她目不转晴地盯着自己的手指，直看得手指在她眼里都变成了蓝色。婚礼前两天气氛更加热闹和盛大——各种礼物纷纷送进家门，其中包括华贵的地毯、美艳的鲜花。这一切都给家里带来了异乎寻常的喜庆气氛。在两位新人正式结合的关键时刻，人群都挤在餐厅里，长老会牧师用浓重的苏格兰口音念念有词为他们证婚。当这个杂货店职员手挽着新娘的时候，大厅里突然奏起了欢快的音乐。这时候人群中传来了一阵杂乱声、女人们歇斯底里般的叫声和人们的问候声。黛西伏在远房表姐贝丝的怀里不停地呜呜哭泣着。贝丝·彭特兰这次是和她精神饱满的红脸丈夫一同前来的，她的丈夫是南卡罗来纳州一家小食品杂货连锁店的老板。他们带了一些礼物和一只巨大的西瓜。此刻她的心里也不免有些难过，但是婚礼过后，她才发现自己在婚前几个星期就动手赶制的一件新衣，竟然在慌乱中穿反了，这使她更加难受了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus Daisy passed more or less definitely out of Eugene's life, although he was to see her briefly on visits, but with decreasing frequency, in the years that followed. The grocery clerk was making the one daring gesture of his life: he was breaking away from the cotton town, in which all the years of his life had been passed, and from the long lazy hours of grocery clerks, the languorous gossip of lank cotton farmers and townsmen, to which he had been used. He had found employment as a commercial traveller for a food products company: his headquarters was to be in Augusta, Georgia, but he was to travel into the far South.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the early autumn after her marriage, Gant made the journey to Augusta, taking Eugene with him. The inner excitement of both was intense; the hot wait at the sleepy junction of Spartanburg, the ride in the dilapidated day coaches of the branch line that ran to Augusta, the hot baked autumnal land, rolling piedmont and pine woods, every detail of the landscape they drank in with thirsty adventurous eyes. Gant's roving spirit was parched for lack of travel: for Eugene, Saint Louis was a faint unreality, but there burned in him a vision of the opulent South, stranger even than his passionate winter nostalgia for the snow-bound North, which the drifted but short-lived snows in Altamont, the seizure of the unaccustomed moment for sledding and skating on the steep hills awakened in him with a Northern desire, a desire for the dark, the storm, the winds that roar across the earth and the triumphant comfort of warm walls which only a Southerner perhaps can know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黛西结婚后的那年初秋，甘特带着尤金到奥古斯塔去探望她。他们二人内心都特别激动，父子俩站在炎热、昏沉沉的斯巴腾堡车站等待着车子，他们打算乘坐的是通往奥古斯塔支线的破旧客车。秋日里穿过干巴巴的大地、经过起伏的山峦和大片的松林，满怀着渴望、好奇的眼睛捕捉着窗外的每一处细微景致。甘特本人也很长时间没有出过远门了，所以此刻，他天生喜好云游四方的激情终于释放了出来；至于尤金，圣路易的经历已经成了模糊的回忆，但是在他的脑海里总会闪现出富饶美丽的南方来。这种感受甚至超过了他对北方迷人冬天的向往，因为在阿尔特蒙，冬天的时候只会下一两场小雪，孩子们常会抓住这样的难得机会跑到陡峭的山坡上去溜冰、滑雪。想到这些，他恨不得成为北方人、渴望雪夜风暴的幻想就会被激醒，因为当北风怒吼着席卷大地的时候，只有南方人才能切身地领悟到那一份惬意和温暖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he went to Augusta, and began his new life with Daisy in a lodging house. She was twenty-one, a slender, blushing girl who played the piano beautifully, accurately, academically, with a rippling touch, and no imagination. Eugene could never remember her very well.</div>

<div class="line_en">And he saw the town of Augusta first not in the drab hues of reality, but as one who bursts a window into the faery pageant of the world, as one who has lived in prison, and finds life and the earth in rosy dawn, as one who has lived in all the fabulous imagery of books, and finds in a journey only an extension and verification of it -- so did he see Augusta, with the fresh washed eyes of a child, with glory, with enchantment.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were gone two weeks. He remembered chiefly the brown stains of the recent flood, which had flowed through the town and inundated its lower floors, the broad main street, the odorous and gleaming drugstore, scented to him with all the spices of his fancy, the hills and fields of Aiken, in South Carolina, where he sought vainly for John D. Rockefeller, a legendary prince who, he heard, went there for sport, marvelling that two States could join imperceptibly, without visible markings, and the cotton gin where he saw the great press mash the huge raw bales cleanly into tight bundles half their former size.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们去了两个星期。这次经历中他印象最深的主要是不久前爆发的那次洪水，到处都留下了褐色的水痕。这场洪水横扫整个小城，淹没了较低的楼层、宽广的大街，淹没了散发着浓烈气味、灯火通明的杂货店，淹没了南卡罗来纳州的艾肯山，他曾经在那里徒劳地寻找过传奇人物约翰·D。洛克菲勒，因为有人说他经常到那里去打猎。吃惊之余，他发现这两个州毗邻在一起，竟然没有任何界线。另外，他还看见庞大的轧棉机把大捆大捆的棉花压制成密实、整齐的棉包，体积比原先缩小了一半。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went to the theatre: it was one of the first plays he had seen.
