<div class="line_en">Someone's there. Arya chewed her lip. All the other places they'd come upon had been empty and desolate. Farms, villages, castles, septs, barns, it made no matter. If it could burn, the Lannisters had burned it; if it could die, they'd killed it. They had even set the woods ablaze where they could, though the leaves were still green and wet from recent rains, and the fires had not spread. "They would have burned the lake if they could have," Gendry had said, and Arya knew he was right. On the night of their escape, the flames of the burning town had shimmered so brightly on the water that it had seemed that the lake was afire.</div>

<div class="line_en">The axe blow that had killed him had split his skull apart, but the great tangled beard could be no one else's, or the garb, patched and unwashed and so faded it was more grey than black. Ser Amory Lorch had given no more thought to burying his own dead than to those he had murdered, and the corpses of four Lannister men-at-arms were heaped near Yoren's. Arya wondered how many it had taken to bring him down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那记致命的利斧把他头颅整个劈成了两半，但那把纠缠不清的大胡子，以及身上那件满是补丁、从不清洗、早已褪成灰色的黑衣又是那么地醒目。亚摩利·洛奇爵士既没有埋葬对手，也没有埋葬自己人。四名兰尼斯特士兵倒在尤伦身边，艾莉亚想知道究竟死了多少人才把他击倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they finally summoned the nerve to steal back into the ruins the next night, nothing remained but blackened stones, the hollow shells of houses, and corpses. In some places wisps of pale smoke still rose from the ashes. Hot Pie had pleaded with them not to go back, and Lommy called them fools and swore that Ser Amory would catch them and kill them too, but Lorch and his men had long gone by the time they reached the holdfast. They found the gates broken down, the walls partly demolished, and the inside strewn with the unburied dead. One look was enough for Gendry. "They're killed, every one," he said. "And dogs have been at them too, look."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出事后第二天夜里，他们才好不容易鼓起勇气，偷偷溜回庄园的废墟。现场只剩焦黑的断垣残壁和遍地死尸，有些灰烬还在冒着苍白的烟缕。热派曾死命哀求他们不要回去，罗米则称他们为笨蛋，并发誓亚摩利爵士定会把他们抓起来杀掉。但当他们回去时，洛奇和他的人马早已离开。他们发现庄园大门砍倒，墙壁半塌，内里遍地死尸。詹德利只看一眼就受不了。“他们死了，全死了。”他说，“还被狗啃过，你看。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Gendry who thought of the lord's towerhouse and the three that Yoren had sent to hold it. They had come under attack as well, but the round tower had only one entry, a second-story door reached by a ladder. Once that had been pulled inside, Ser Amory's men could not get at them. The Lannisters had piled brush around the tower's base and set it afire, but the stone would not burn, and Lorch did not have the patience to starve them out. Cutjack opened the door at Gendry's shout, and when Kurz said they'd be better pressing on north than going back, Arya had clung to the hope that she still might reach Winterfell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后詹德利想到了之前被尤伦派去塔楼的那三个人，他们虽然也遭到攻击，但那圆形的塔楼仅有一个入口，尚且位于二楼，必须搭梯子上去，一旦楼梯被收进塔里，亚摩利爵士的手下就奈何不了他们。兰尼斯特家的人马虽然在塔底堆上干柴放火，但石头烧不起来，而洛奇又没耐心把里面的人逼出来。此刻詹德利一叫唤，凯杰克就开门出来。艾莉亚一听库兹建议他们继续北上，不能回头，心中便重复燃起返回临冬城的希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was going to take me home, she thought as they dug the old man's hole. There were too many dead to bury them all, but Yoren at least must have a grave, Arya had insisted. He was going to bring me safe to Winterfell, he promised. Part of her wanted to cry. The other part wanted to kick him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他本来要带我回家呢，他们一边为老人挖墓，她心里一边想。庄里死人太多，无法全部埋葬，但艾莉亚坚持无论如何都该为尤伦挖个坟。他本来向我保证，要把我安全带回临冬城呢。她很想哭，却又很想用力踢他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, this village was no Winterfell, but those thatched roofs promised warmth and shelter and maybe even food, if they were bold enough to risk them. Unless it's Lorch there. He had horses; he would have traveled faster than us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，眼前的村落虽然不是临冬城，但那些茅草屋顶代表着温暖和保护，说不定还有吃的。当然，这一切的先决条件是他们胆子够大，愿意冒险靠近。只要里面不是洛奇就好，可他骑马呀，早该走得远远地了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She watched from the tree for a long time, hoping she might see something; a man, a horse, a banner, anything that would help her know. A few times she glimpsed motion, but the buildings were so far off it was hard to be certain. Once, very clearly, she heard the whinny of a horse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站在树上观望良久，盼望能看到些什么：一个人、一匹马、一面旗，任何能提供讯息的东西都好。有几次，她隐约见到一点动静，然而房屋的距离实在太远，无法确定。但有一回，非常清晰地，她听见了马的嘶叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was full of birds, crows mostly. From afar, they were no larger than flies as they wheeled and flapped above the thatched roofs. To the east, Gods Eye was a sheet of sun-hammered blue that filled half the world. Some days, as they made their slow way up the muddy shore (Gendry wanted no part of any roads, and even Hot Pie and Lommy saw the sense in that), Arya felt as though the lake were calling her. She wanted to leap into those placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun. But she dare not take off her clothes where the others could see, not even to wash them. At the end of the day she would often sit on a rock and dangle her feet in the cool water. She had finally thrown away her cracked and rotted shoes. Walking barefoot was hard at first, but the blisters had finally broken, the cuts had healed, and her soles had turned to leather. The mud was nice between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she walked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天上满是飞鸟，大半为乌鸦。它们在茅草屋上空振翅盘旋，远处观之，大小和苍蝇无异。东边的神眼湖活像一片被太阳敲出的蓝，占据了半个世界。近来几天，他们沿着泥泞的湖岸缓缓前进（詹德利死也不肯接近任何道路，就连热派和罗米也觉得有理），艾莉亚时时觉得湖水似乎在呼唤她。她好想一头跃进平静的蓝湖，把自己洗个干净，游个泳、泼泼水，然后躺在艳阳下晒干。可她不敢在其他人面前脱衣服，连洗衣服都不敢。所以每天日落，她只能常坐在湖边岩石上，两脚垂在沁凉的湖水中。后来她把那双破烂不堪的鞋子丢了。赤脚走路起初很痛苦，但水泡会破，割伤会愈合，最后她的脚底硬得跟皮革一样。脚趾间满是湿泥的感觉很舒服，她喜欢肌肤与大地相连的悸动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From up here, she could see a small wooded island off to the northeast. Thirty yards from shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so serene… no one had told them that war had come, and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men. She stared at them with yearning. Part of her wanted to be a swan. The other part wanted to eat one. She had broken her fast on some acorn paste and a handful of bugs. Bugs weren't so bad when you got used to them. Worms were worse, but still not as bad as the pain in your belly after days without food. Finding bugs was easy, all you had to do was kick over a rock. Arya had eaten a bug once when she was little, just to make Sansa screech, so she hadn't been afraid to eat another. Weasel wasn't either, but Hot Pie retched up the beetle he tried to swallow, and Lommy and Gendry wouldn't even try. Yesterday Gendry had caught a frog and shared it with Lommy, and, a few days before, Hot Pie had found blackberries and stripped the bush bare, but mostly they had been living on water and acorns. Kurz had told them how to use rocks and make a kind of acorn paste. It tasted awful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这里看去，她可以见到东北方一座林木茂密的小岛。离岸三十码处，三只黑天鹅游弋水面，好一幅安详景致…没人告诉它们战争已经来临，焚毁的城镇和惨死的人们也与它们无关。她羡慕地望着它们，心里的一部分想变成天鹅，另一部分却又想杀一只来吃。她的早餐是橡子糊和一把甲虫。其实只要习惯，甲虫并不难咽，蠕虫就困难多了。但再怎么难吃，总比天天饿肚子好。甲虫很容易找，随便踢翻石头就有。艾莉亚小时候，曾有一次为了看珊莎尖叫，故意吃下一只甲虫，所以如今再吃没什么障碍。“黄鼠狼”也平静接受，可热派刚试着要吞，便把虫呕了出来。至于罗米和詹德利，则连试都不敢试。昨天詹德利抓到一只青蛙，和罗米分着吃了。几天前热派还找着一堆黑莓，他们立刻把整丛摘了个一干二净。但多数时候，他们得靠清水和橡子为生。库兹教他们如何用石头磨一种橡子糊，那味道糟透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wished the poacher hadn't died. He'd known more about the woods than all the rest of them together, but he'd taken an arrow through the shoulder pulling in the ladder at the towerhouse. Tarber had packed it with mud and moss from the lake, and for a day or two Kurz swore the wound was nothing, even though the flesh of his throat was turning dark while angry red welts crept up his jaw and down his chest. Then one morning he couldn't find the strength to get up, and by the next he was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她真希望盗猎者库兹没死，关于森林的知识，他比其他人加起来懂的还多，可那晚他在守卫塔收梯子时被人一箭射穿了肩膀。塔柏用湖边的泥巴和青苔为他敷伤，前两天库兹直说这伤不碍事，虽然他喉咙的血肉逐渐转黑，恐怖的红肿条痕从下巴一路长到胸前。后来有天早上，他没力气起身，第二天就死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They buried him under a mound of stones, and Cutjack had claimed his sword and hunting horn, while Tarber helped himself to bow and boots and knife. They'd taken it all when they left. At first they thought the two had just gone hunting, that they'd soon return with game and feed them all. But they waited and waited, until finally Gendry made them move on. Maybe Tarber and Cutjack figured they would stand a better chance without a gaggle of orphan boys to herd along. They probably would too, but that didn't stop her hating them for leaving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们堆石头做成他的坟墓，凯杰克拿了他的剑和猎号，塔柏则取走弓箭、靴子和短刀。两人离开时，把这些都带走了。起初他们以为这两人只是去打猎，不多久便会带着猎物回来喂饱他们。可他们等啊等，直到最后詹德利驱使他们上路。或许塔柏和凯杰克认为抛下这群孤儿不管，自己存活的机会比较大。说不定事实果真如此，但这并未减少她对他们的恨意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beneath her tree, Hot Pie barked like a dog. Kurz had told them to use animal sounds to signal to each other. An old poacher's trick, he'd said, but he'd died before he could teach them how to make the sounds right. Hot Pie's bird calls were awful. His dog was better, but not much.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya hopped from the high branch to one beneath it, her hands out for balance. A water dancer never falls. Lightfoot, her toes curled tight around the branch, she walked a few feet, hopped down to a larger limb, then swung hand over hand through the tangle of leaves until she reached the trunk. The bark was rough beneath her fingers, against her toes. She descended quickly, jumping down the final six feet, rolling when she landed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside the gently lapping waters of Gods Eye, a long gibbet of raw green wood had been thrown up, and things that had once been men dangled there, their feet in chains, while crows pecked at their flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse. For every crow there were a hundred flies. When the wind blew off the lake, the nearest corpse twisted on its chain, ever so slightly. The crows had eaten most of its face, and something else had been at it as well, something much larger. Throat and chest had been torn apart, and glistening green entrails and ribbons of ragged flesh dangled from where the belly had been opened. One arm had been ripped right off the shoulder; Arya saw the bones a few feet away, gnawed and cracked, picked clean of meat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fear cuts deeper than swords. Dead men could not hurt her, but whoever had killed them could. Well beyond the gibbet, two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on their spears in front of the long low building by the water, the one with the slate roof. A pair of tall poles had been driven into the muddy ground in front of it, banners drooping from each staff. One looked red and one paler, white or yellow maybe, but both were limp and with the dusk settling, she could not even be certain that red one was Lannister crimson. I don't need to see the lion, I can see all the dead people, who else would it be but Lannisters?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐惧比利剑更伤人。死人伤不了她，但杀死他们的人却可以。绞刑架后方远处，两个身穿盔甲的人拄着长枪，站在水边的低矮长屋前，那间屋有石板屋顶。门前的泥地上插了两根长竿，上面挂着旗帜，一面红，一面颜色比较淡，可能是白或者黄，但两者都低垂着，加上天光渐暗，所以她不能确定那是不是兰尼斯特家的深红。我用不着见到狮子图案，这些死人就说明了一切，除了兰尼斯特，还会有谁？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two spearmen turned at the cry, and a third man came into view, shoving a captive before him. It was growing too dark to make out faces, but the prisoner was wearing a shiny steel helm, and when Arya saw the horns she knew it was Gendry. You stupid stupid stupid STUPID! she thought. If he'd been here she would have kicked him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两名长枪兵立刻转头，只见第三人推着一名俘虏出现在视线里。天色很暗，看不清长相，可犯人戴着一顶闪亮的钢盔，艾莉亚一见头盔上的双角，便知是詹德利无疑。你笨蛋笨蛋笨蛋笨蛋！她心想。如果他还在身边，她一定再踢他一通。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The guards were talking loudly, but she was too far away to make out the words, especially with the crows gabbling and flapping closer to hand. One of the spearmen snatched the helm off Gendry's head and asked him a question, but he must not have liked the answer, because he smashed him across the face with the butt of his spear and knocked him down. The one who'd captured him gave him a kick, while the second spearman was trying on the bull's-head helm. Finally they pulled him to his feet and marched him off toward the storehouse. When they opened the heavy wooden doors, a small boy darted out, but one of the guards grabbed his arm and flung him back inside. Arya heard sobbing from inside the building, and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that it made her bite her lip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个守卫高声交谈，但她距离实在太远，听不出讲些什么，附近又有大批乌鸦怪叫着拍翅干扰。一名枪兵抢下詹德利的头盔，问了一个问题，并显然对答案不满意，便照着他的脸一挥枪柄，把他打倒在地。抓到他的人随后踢了他一脚，另一个枪兵则在一旁试戴牛角盔。最后，他们拉他起来，押着他朝那间长屋走去。当他们打开厚重的木门，立时有一个小男孩窜出，却被守卫一把攫住手臂，扔回屋里。艾莉亚听见里面传出啜泣，接着是一声凄厉痛苦的惨叫，她不由得咬紧嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The guards shoved Gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind them. Just then, a breath of wind came sighing off the lake, and the banners stirred and lifted. The one on the tall staff bore the golden lion, as she'd feared. On the other, three sleek black shapes ran across a field as yellow as butter. Dogs, she thought. Arya had seen those dogs before, but where?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="守卫把詹德利也推了进去，然后拴上门。就在这时，一阵清风从湖面吹来，两面旗帜抖了一下，飘了起来。正如她所担心的，高的那根竿子的旗上绣着金狮子。另一面则是奶油黄，绣有三个油亮的黑色形体。是狗，她想。艾莉亚以前见过这些狗，但是在哪儿呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the guards took off his helm and donned Gendry's instead. It made her angry to see him wearing it, but she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him.

<div class="line_cn" title="一名守卫摘下自己的头盔，改戴詹德利那顶，她见了火冒三丈，但她知道自己阻止不了他。她隐约听见各种尖叫从那栋无窗的仓库中传出，隔着石墙，显得很模糊，她不敢确定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stayed long enough to see the guard changed, and much more besides. Men came and went. They led their horses down to the stream to drink. A hunting party returned from the wood, carrying a deer's carcass slung from a pole. She watched them clean and gut it and build a cookfire on the far side of the stream, and the smell of cooking meat mingled queerly with the stench of corruption. Her empty belly roiled and she thought she might retch. The prospect of food brought other men out of the houses, near all of them wearing bits of mail or boiled leather. When the deer was cooked, the choicest portions were carried to one of the houses.</div>

It was a black night, with a thin sliver of moon appearing and disappearing as the clouds blew past. Silent as a shadow, she told herself as she moved through the trees. In this darkness she dared not run, for fear of tripping on some unseen root or losing her way. On her left Gods Eye lapped calmly against its shores.

Three black dogs raced across his faded yellow surcoat, and his face looked as hard as if it had been cut from stone. Suddenly Arya knew where she had seen those dogs before. The night of the tourney at King's Landing, all the knights had hung their shields outside their pavilions.
