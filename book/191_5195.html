<div class="line_en">You will remember there was no road -- not even a pathway -- between the castle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">They knew, of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were lost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning -- all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，他们知道的，必须对准着起来的太阳，笔直地向东方走，他们就用了这方法动身。但是在中午，当太阳照在他们头顶上时，他们就不能够分辩哪里是东方，哪里是西方，因此，他们便迷失在广阔的田野里了。不管怎么样，他们只能不停地走着，直走到晚上，月亮升起来了，明亮地照着。除了稻草人和铁皮人以外，他们都在发出香气的深红色的花丛中，躺下来一直鼾睡到天亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘我的美丽的朋友，游泳出来吧，’我的祖父叫喊着，‘看，水将沾污你的衣服了。’奎拉拉虽然很聪明，可是不大会游泳，却因为他的运气好，没有受到一点儿损伤，当他冒出水面，游向岸边去时，他大笑着。这时候，甘林达跑了出来，跑到他那里，她看见他的绸和天鹅绒的衣服，完全给江水弄脏了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had all the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and all the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap, whosoever he may be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这位公主大大地发怒，当然，她知道这事是谁干的。她把所有的飞猴都召到她的面前，起初她说，它们的翅翼必须捆绑着，必须像他们对待奎拉拉那样地受惩罚，被抛落在江水中。但是我的祖父竭力地辩解着，因为它知道，这些猴子们被捆绑了翅膀，将在江水中都被溺死，奎拉拉也替它说好话。因此，最后甘林达惩罚飞猴们，必须在戴金冠的主人吩咐以后，服役三次，在这一个条件上，才能赦免了它们。这顶金冠，是为了举行婚礼制赠给奎拉拉的，据说费了公主财富的一半。当然，我的祖父和所有的猴子们，立刻同意这个条件。这就是我们为什么会被戴这顶金冠的不论是谁，都可以这么叫唤着，就必须为他服役三次的缘故。”">查看中文翻译</div>

As his bride could not bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her. This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West.
