<div class="line_en">In the world of the "asset column," being an Indian giver is vital to wealth. The sophisticated investor's first question is, "How fast do I get my money back?" They also want to know what they get for free, also called a piece of the action. That is why the ROI, or return of and on investment, is so important.</div>

<div class="line_en">7. BE AN "INDIAN GIVER": This is the power of getting something for nothing. When the first white settlers came to America, they were taken aback by a cultural practice some American Indians had. For example, if a settler was cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it for a gift, the settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="7、做一个“印第安给予者”：无私的力量。当第一批白人定居者抵达美洲时，他们对印第安人的文化习惯感到惊讶和不适应。例如，当看到一个白人很冷时，印第安人会给那人一条毯子，可白人定居者误以为这是一份礼物，因此当印第安人要回毯子时，他们感到十分不快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For example, I found a small condominium, a few blocks from where I live, that was in foreclosure. The bank wanted $60,000, and I submitted a bid for $50,000, which they took, simply because, along with my bid, was a cashier's check for $50,000. They realized I was serious. Most investors would say, aren't you tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be better to get a loan on it? The answer is, not in this case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="例如，我发现一处已没收的抵押品就在我家附近几个街区。 银行要价6万美元，我出价5万美元，他们接受了，原因仅仅是出价的条件之一是开出5万美元的现金支票。他们意识到我是认真的。大部分投资者会说，你这不是冻结了一大笔现金吗？申请一笔贷款不是更好吗？答案是：有道理，但不适用于这一案例。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">True, I have lost money on many occasions. But I only play with money I can afford to lose. I would say, on an average ten investments, I hit home runs on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I lose on two or three. But I limit my losses to only the money I have in at that time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，在许多情况下我曾损失过资金，但我总是能负担得起损失的资金。我想，在平均每十项投资中，我会有2～3项赢利，同时5—6项不赚不赔，2～3项亏本。但是我会将自己可能发生的损失限制在那个时期我所拥有的资金量这一范围内。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker will call me and recommend I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a company that he feels is just about to make a move that will add value to the stock, like announcing a new product. I will move my money in for a week to a month while the stock moves up. Then, I pull my initial dollar amount out, and stop worrying about the fluctuations of the market, because my initial money is back and ready to work on another asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own an asset that was technically free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在股票市场上我也这样做。经常地，我的经纪人会打电话给我，建议我动用一笔数额可观的资金，用来购买他认为会有上涨行情的公司股票，比如拥有某种新产品的公司的股票。于是，我会在股票上涨前的一周到一个月期间将资金调人，赢利后，我便抽回投入的初始资金，并不再担心此后市场的波动，因为我投入的初始资金已经收回，并又投资于其他资产了。我的资金通过投入又收回，使我拥有了一笔从技术上来说是无偿取得的资产。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For people who hate risk, they put their money in the bank. And in the long run, savings are better than no savings.

He's got only $1,000 left, but his interest and learning are sky high. He knows that if he loses that money, he walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems uninterested in getting a car because he's found a game that is more fun."</div>

<div class="line_en">As I said in the section "Pay Yourself First," if a person cannot master the power of self-discipline, it is best not to try to get rich. For while the process of developing cash flow from an asset column in theory is easy, it is the mental fortitude of directing money that is hard. Due to external temptations, it is much easier in today's consumer world to simply blow it out the expense column. Because of weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the paths of least resistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在“首先支付你自己”一节中，我说到如果一个人没有自律的能力，最好别想着去致富。因为从理论上来讲，一项资产产生现金流量的过程是容易的，但是拥有控制金钱的坚强意志却是困难的。由于种种外在的诱惑，在今天的消费者世界里，在支出项目上挥霍金钱更加容易。因为意志薄弱，金钱的流出简直会无遮无拦，这就是大多数人贫困和财务困窘的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

My educated dad gave a lot by the way of time and knowledge, but almost never gave away money. As I said, he usually said that he would give when he had some extra money. Of course, there was rarely any extra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="10、先予后取：给予的力量。我的两个爸爸都是教师。我的富爸爸教给了我一生受用的经验，那就是乐善好施的必要性。我的受到良好教育的爸爸花了很长时间广泛传授知识，却几乎没有施舍钱财。他常常说要是有额外的钱，就会施舍给别人，可是，他很少会有多余的钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But heroes do more than simply inspire us. Heroes make things look easy. It's the making it look easy that convinces us to want to be just like them. "If they can do it, so can I."</div>

<div class="line_en">If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel "short" or in "need" of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, friendship. I know it is often the last thing a person may want to do, but; it has always worked for me. I just trust that the principle of reciprocity it is true, and I give what I want. I want money, so I give money, and it comes back in multiples. I want sales, so I help someone else sell something, and sales come to me. I want contacts and I help someone else get contacts, and like magic, contacts come to me. I heard a saying years ago that went, "God does not need to receive, but humans need to give."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我能给你提供一种思路的话，那一定是这个思路：当你感到手头“短缺”或“需要”什么时，首先要想到给予，只有先“予”，你才会在将来“取”得回报，无论金钱、微笑、爱情还是友谊，都是这样。我知道人们常常会把这件事放在最后，但事实证明这样做对我总是大有种益的。我相信互利互惠的原则是正确的，我为自己想要的东西付出成本。我需要金钱，所以我给予别人以金钱，然后我又成倍地收回这些金钱；我想做销售，所以我帮助其他人出售东西，这样我也能做销售了；我需要订立合同做生意，所以我会尽自己所能去帮助其他人得到合同，就像魔术一样，我所需要的合同也来到了我手中。多年前我曾听到一句谚语说“上帝不需要得到什么，可人类却需要付出什么”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly in tithing. "If you want something, you first need to give," he would always say. When he was short of money, he simply gave money to his church or to his favorite charity.</div>

<div class="line_en">My rich dad would often say, "Poor people are more greedy than rich people." He would explain that if a person was rich, that person was providing something that other people wanted. In my life, over all these. years, whenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply went out or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it first. And when I gave, it always came back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的富爸爸常常说，“穷人比富人更贪婪”。他解释说，如果一个人很富有，那么这个人就能提供其他人想要的东西。截止今天，每当我觉得自己需要点什么，或者缺钱，或者缺少帮助时，我就去想一想，自己心里到底需要什么，然后首先为此而付出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his arms on a cold freezing night, and he is yelling at the pot-bellied stove, "When you give me some heat, then I'll put some wood in." And when it comes to money, love, happiness, sales and contacts, all one needs to remember is first to give what you want and it will come back in droves.? Often just the process of thinking of what I want, and how could I give what I want to someone else, breaks free a torrent of bounty. Whenever I feel that people aren't smiling at me, I simply begin smiling and saying hello, and like magic, there are suddenly more smiling people around me. It is true that your world is only a mirror of you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这使我想起了一个故事，说的是一位抱着柴禾的人坐在寒冷的夜里，冲着一只因缺柴而熄灭的大火炉叫道：“你什么时候给我以温暖，我什么时候才会给你添加柴禾”。推而广之，涉及到金钱、爱情、幸福、销售以及合同等等，人们都应记住必须为自己需要的东西首先付出，然后才能得到加倍回报。常常是在思索我需要什么东西的过程中，以及思索我能为自己需要的东西而付给别人什么的过程中，我会突然变得非常慷慨好施。每当我感到人们不对我微笑时，我就开始笑着对人问好，然后，非常神奇地，似乎我周围突然多出了许多微笑着的人。的确，你的世界就是你的一面镜子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My dad taught teachers, and he became a master teacher. My rich dad always taught young people his way of doing business. In retrospect, it was their generosity with what they knew that made them smarter. There are powers in this world that are much smarter than we are. You can get there on your own, but it's easier with the help of the powers that be. All you need to be is generous with what you have, and the powers will be generous with you.</div>
