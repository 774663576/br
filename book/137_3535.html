<div class="line_en">Opposite the lofty cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone balcony built above the porch of a rich Gothic house, which formed the angle of the square and the Rue du Parvis, several young girls were laughing and chatting with every sort of grace and mirth. From the length of the veil which fell from their pointed coif, twined with pearls, to their heels, from the fineness of the embroidered chemisette which covered their shoulders and allowed a glimpse, according to the pleasing custom of the time, of the swell of their fair virgin bosoms, from the opulence of their under-petticoats still more precious than their overdress (marvellous refinement), from the gauze, the silk, the velvet, with which all this was composed, and, above all, from the whiteness of their hands, which certified to their leisure and idleness, it was easy to divine they were noble and wealthy heiresses.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first of March had arrived. The sun, which Dubartas, that classic ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the "Grand-duke of Candles," was none the less radiant and joyous on that account. It was one of those spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all Paris turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them as though they were Sundays. In those days of brilliancy, warmth, and serenity, there is a certain hour above all others, when the façade of Notre-Dame should be admired. It is the moment when the sun, already declining towards the west, looks the cathedral almost full in the face. Its rays, growing more and more horizontal, withdraw slowly from the pavement of the square, and mount up the perpendicular façade, whose thousand bosses in high relief they cause to start out from the shadows, while the great central rose window flames like the eye of a cyclops, inflamed with the reflections of the forge.</div>

<div class="line_en">The balcony on which these young girls stood opened from a chamber richly tapestried in fawn-colored Flanders leather, stamped with golden foliage. The beams, which cut the ceiling in parallel lines, diverted the eye with a thousand eccentric painted and gilded carvings. Splendid enamels gleamed here and there on carved chests; a boar's head in faience crowned a magnificent dresser, whose two shelves announced that the mistress of the house was the wife or widow of a knight banneret. At the end of the room, by the side of a lofty chimney blazoned with arms from top to bottom, in a rich red velvet arm-chair, sat Dame de Gondelaurier, whose five and fifty years were written upon her garments no less distinctly than upon her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几位姑娘所在的阳台里面客厅墙壁上铺挂着蔓叶图案金饰的微褐色弗兰德尔皮幔。室顶一根根平行横梁上，千百种怪异雕刻金漆彩绘，赏心悦目。橱柜上花纹镂錾，斑斓闪烁着珐琅光泽。一座华丽的食橱上搁着一个陶瓷的野猪头。食橱有两级台阶，表明女主人是方旗骑士（4）的妻子或未亡人。另一端，在一座从上到下尽是纹章的高大壁炉旁边，一张铺垫红色丝绒的豪华安乐椅上，端坐着贡德洛里埃夫人。她那五十五岁年龄既表现在她的面容上，也表现在她的衣着上。【注：（4）方旗是一种战旗。方旗骑士是一种可以举旗纠集附臣和下民前往战斗的骑士，后沿为封建领主的一个等级。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were, in fact, Damoiselle Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier and her companions, Diane de Christeuil, Amelotte de Montmichel, Colombe de Gaillefontaine, and the little de Champchevrier maiden; all damsels of good birth, assembled at that moment at the house of the dame widow de Gondelaurier, on account of Monseigneur de Beaujeu and Madame his wife, who were to come to Paris in the month of April, there to choose maids of honor for the Dauphiness Marguerite, who was to be received in Picardy from the hands of the Flemings. Now, all the squires for twenty leagues around were intriguing for this favor for their daughters, and a goodly number of the latter had been already brought or sent to Paris. These four maidens had been confided to the discreet and venerable charge of Madame Aloise de Gondelaurier, widow of a former commander of the king's cross-bowmen, who had retired with her only daughter to her house in the Place du Parvis, Notre-Dame, in Paris.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were chatting together in that whispering tone and with the half-stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man. The young man whose presence served to set in play all these feminine self-conceits, appeared to pay very little heed to the matter, and, while these pretty damsels were vying with one another to attract his attention, he seemed to be chiefly absorbed in polishing the buckle of his sword belt with his doeskin glove. From time to time, the old lady addressed him in a very low tone, and he replied as well as he was able, with a sort of awkward and constrained politeness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们曼声细语，欲笑还止，正是表明在姑娘们密谈的当儿有一位男士在场。这位男士自己，虽然他在场就足以挑动这些姑娘作为妇人的虚荣心，却好像不怎么介意，虽然置身于一群竞相吸引他的视线的绝色佳人中间，却似乎专心致志于用他那麂皮手套揩拭腰带的环扣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beside her stood a young man of imposing mien, although partaking somewhat of vanity and bravado -- one of those handsome fellows whom all women agree to admire, although grave men learned in physiognomy shrug their shoulders at them. This young man wore the garb of a captain of the king's unattached archers, which bears far too much resemblance to the costume of Jupiter, which the reader has already been enabled to admire in the first book of this history, for us to inflict upon him a second description.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这位好夫人死心眼儿为自己的女儿操心——她这样可怜的妈妈哪里看得出青年军官并不热心，还在一个劲儿地轻声叫他注意：百合花引针走线手指儿是多么灵巧美妙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the smiles and significant gestures of Dame Aloise, from the glances which she threw towards her daughter, Fleur-de-Lys, as she spoke low to the captain, it was easy to see that there was here a question of some betrothal concluded, some marriage near at hand no doubt, between the young man and Fleur-de-Lys. From the embarrassed coldness of the officer, it was easy to see that on his side, at least, love had no longer any part in the matter. His whole air was expressive of constraint and weariness, which our lieutenants of the garrison would to-day translate admirably as, "What a beastly bore!"</div>

Moreover, he was of a fickle disposition, and, must we say it, rather vulgar in taste. Although of very noble birth, he had contracted in his official harness more than one habit of the common trooper. The tavern and its accompaniments pleased him. He was only at his ease amid gross language, military gallantries, facile beauties, and successes yet more easy. He had, nevertheless, received from his family some education and some politeness of manner; but he had been thrown on the world too young, he had been in garrison at too early an age, and every day the polish of a gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his gendarme's cross-belt. While still continuing to visit her from time to time, from a remnant of common respect, he felt doubly embarrassed with Fleur-de-Lys; in the first place, because, in consequence of having scattered his love in all sorts of places, he had reserved very little for her; in the next place, because, amid so many stiff, formal, and decent ladies, he was in constant fear lest his mouth, habituated to oaths, should suddenly take the bit in its teeth, and break out into the language of the tavern. The effect can be imagined!</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="贝朗惹尔拍起手来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold. Her appearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls. It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all, that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries, and that from the moment he presented himself, there existed among them a secret, suppressed rivalry, which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves, but which broke forth, none the less, every instant, in their gestures and remarks. Nevertheless, as they were all very nearly equal in beauty, they contended with equal arms, and each could hope for the victory.-- The arrival of the gypsy suddenly destroyed this equilibrium. Her beauty was so rare, that, at the moment when she appeared at the entrance of the apartment, it seemed as though she diffused a sort of light which was peculiar to herself. In that narrow chamber, surrounded by that sombre frame of hangings and woodwork, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than on the public square. She was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark. The noble damsels were dazzled by her in spite of themselves. Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded in her beauty. Hence, their battle front (may we be allowed the expression,) was immediately altered, although they exchanged not a single word. But they understood each other perfectly. Women's instincts comprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences of men. An enemy had just arrived; all felt it -- all rallied together. One drop of wine is sufficient to tinge a glass of water red; to diffuse a certain degree of ill temper throughout a whole assembly of pretty women, the arrival of a prettier woman suffices, especially when there is but one man present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，跳舞姑娘站在门口一动也不动。她的出现对这群姑娘产生了奇特的效果。固然，姑娘们内心中都激荡着取悦于英俊军官的朦朦胧胧的愿望，他那漂亮的军服是她们卖弄风情的焦点，只要他在场，她们之间就会展开一场悄然无声的竞争，虽然她们自己心里也不肯承认，但随时还是从她们一举一动、一言一行中爆发出来。不过，她们彼此大体上美貌相埒，她们便以不相上下的实力展开角逐，每一位都能期望获得胜利。吉卜赛姑娘的来临却猝然粉碎了这一均势。她艳丽惊人，不同凡响，刚一出现在房门口，就仿佛散发出只有她才固有的光辉。在这间壅塞的客厅里，在这幽暗的帷幔和护壁环绕之中，她比在广场上更为美丽动人，更为光艳万分。仿佛是一支火炬，从大天光中突然拿进了黑暗所在。那几位贵族小姐不由得心摇目眩。一个个都感到自己的美貌受到了损伤。因此，她们的战线——请允许我这样措词——顿时改变了，虽然她们互相之间一个招呼也没打。其实，她们声息相通，灵敏之至。大凡妇女，她们的本能互相感应、互相理解，比男人快得多。这几位小姐顿时觉得进来了一个敌人，她们全感觉到了，就团结起来了。只需一滴葡萄酒，就可以把整个一杯水染红；要使一群美貌女子染上某种不快情绪，只需来到一个更为美貌的女子——尤其在只有一位男士的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, in truth, a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator than Phoebus, to see how these beautiful maidens, with their envenomed and angry tongues, wound, serpent-like, and glided and writhed around the street dancer. They were cruel and graceful; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel. There was no end to their laughter, irony, and humiliation. Sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy, and haughty condescension and malevolent looks. One would have thought they were young Roman dames thrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave. One would have pronounced them elegant grayhounds, circling, with inflated nostrils, round a poor woodland fawn, whom the glance of their master forbade them to devour.</div>

From time to time a flush of shame, a flash of anger inflamed her eyes or her cheeks; with disdain she made that little grimace with which the reader is already familiar, but she remained motionless; she fixed on Phoebus a sad, sweet, resigned look.

Hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting, when the child, with surprise, beheld the goat (one of whose "miracles" this was no doubt), draw out certain letters with its golden hoof, and arrange them, with gentle pushes, in a certain order. In a moment they constituted a word, which the goat seemed to have been trained to write, so little hesitation did it show in forming it, and Bérangère suddenly exclaimed, clasping her hands in admiration,—</div>
