<div class="line_en">It so happened that the two of them were playing with other children in a meadow in front their house. There was a pond in the meadow that came up to one side of the house. The children ran around it, caught one another, and played a counting out game:</div>

<div class="line_en">While playing this game they stood in a circle, and the one to whom they were pointing when they said "cut them up" had to run away, and all the others would run after him and catch him. While they were thus running about so joyfully the stepmother was watching them from the window, and grew angry. Because she understood the art of witchcraft she bewitched them both, transforming the little brother into a fish, and the little sister into a lamb.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cook went and got the little lamb, took her into the kitchen, and tied her feet together. She bore all this patiently. The cook then took out his knife and was whetting it on the doorstep in order to kill the little lamb when he saw how a little fish was swimming back and forth in the water in front of the gutter and looking up at him. This was the little brother, for when the little fish saw the cook take the little lamb away, he followed them, swimming along the pond as far as the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那厨子去了，把羊儿牵到厨房，捆住了她的四蹄。这一切，小羊羔顺从地忍了。当厨子拔出刀子，在台级上磨了磨，正要下手宰羊时，他看到了似乎有条鱼儿在来回地游动，并抬起头望着他。这鱼儿就是那个小弟弟，因为他看见了厨子带走了那羊羔，它便尾随着从池塘游到了屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little fish swam back and forth in the pond and was sad, and the little lamb walked back and forth in the meadow and was sad, and would not eat. She would not even touch one blade of grass. Thus a long time passed, and then some strangers came as guests to the castle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now this peasant woman had been the wet nurse for the little sister, and she suspected at once who the little lamb was, and took him with her to a wise woman.

After this she took them both to a little hut in a large forest, where they lived by themselves, contented and happy.</div>
