<div class="line_en">Dr. Simons tapped at the table with his forefinger. "The thought around here is that it's possible the Phalanxifor is worsening the edema, but we'd face far more serious problems if we discontinued its use."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're going to stay the course," Dr. Maria said, "but we'll need to do more to keep that edema from building up." I felt kind of sick for some reason, like I was going to throw up. I hated Cancer Team Meetings in general, but I hated this one in particular. "Your cancer is not going away, Hazel. But we've seen people live with your level of tumor penetration for a long time." (I did not ask what constituted a long time. I'd made that mistake before.)

<div class="line_en">Dr. Maria's lips shrank into her mouth. "You would not be considered a strong candidate for a transplant, unfortunately," she said. I understood: No use wasting good lungs on a hopeless case. I nodded, trying not to look like that comment hurt me. My dad started crying a little. I didn't look over at him, but no one said anything for a long time, so his hiccuping cry was the only sound in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽亚医生抿紧了嘴：“很不幸，你不会被评估为移植手术的有力人选。”我懂了：把健康的肺浪费在毫无希望的病人身上没有用。我点点头，努力不露出受伤的神情。爸爸开始流眼泪。我没有看他，但很长一段时间没有一个人说话，于是他压抑的抽泣成了房间里唯一的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just before the Miracle, when I was in the ICU and it looked like I was going to die and Mom was telling me it was okay to let go, and I was trying to let go but my lungs kept searching for air, Mom sobbed something into Dad's chest that I wish I hadn't heard, and that I hope she never finds out that I did hear.

<div class="line_en">Anyway, eventually we decided to keep things the same only with more frequent fluid drainings. At the end, I asked if I could travel to Amsterdam, and Dr. Simons actually and literally laughed, but then Dr. Maria said, "Why not?" And Simons said, dubiously, "Why not?" And Dr. Maria said, "Yeah, I don't see why not. They've got oxygen on the planes, after all." Dr. Simons said, "Are they just going to gate-check a BiPAP?"
