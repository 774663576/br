<div class="line_en">The night was bitterly cold. A sharp wind whipped the fallen snow up into the air and blew it into every hole and corner. It was a night for the homeless to lie down and die; and for luckier people to sit close to their fires and thank God They were at home.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, indeed, ma'am," replied the beadle. "We've had to give out to the poor people in this town great quantities of bread and cheese today, and They're still complaining.

<div class="line_en">In the workhouse where Oliver was born, Mrs Corney -- the widow in charge -- was making tea by her fire.

<div class="line_en">Mrs Corney agreed that it was very shocking. They discussed some workhouse business together, and then Mr Bumble looked hopefully at the teapot. Mrs Corney offered him some tea. Instantly, Mr Bumble sat down by the fire and gave the widow such a warm smile that her face turned a delicate pink. She passed Mr Bumble the tea-cup, and as he took it, he managed to give her hand a little stroke. "You're a kind-hearted woman, Mrs Corney," said the beadle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="科尼太太点着头，说这是叫人很吃惊的。他们一起商量了一些济贫院的事，然后班布尔先生满怀希望地看着茶壶。科尼太太请他喝茶，立刻，班布尔先生在靠近炉火的地方坐了下来，并热情地向她笑了一笑。这使她的脸微微发红，娇艳无比。她把茶杯递给班布尔先生时，他接过茶杯，顺势抚摸了一下她的手。“你真是个好心的女人，科尼太太。”执事说。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Dodger, as usual, was winning easily; somehow, he always seemed to know exactly what cards the other players had in their hand s.

<div class="line_en">Morning came, but Oliver still lay in the field as if dead. It began to rain heavily, and after a while Oliver opened his eyes. His left arm was covered in blood and hurting badly. He felt so weak he could hardly stand, but he knew that if he stayed where he was, he would die. Gasping with pain, he forced himself to his feet and with slow, shaky steps, began to walk. He had no idea where he was going, and moved forward mechanically, as though in a dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now midmorning. Inside the house the men servants were still describing the night's adventures to the cook and the servant girl, who gasped with appreciative horror at every exciting moment. They were all enjoying themselves very much -- when there came a knock at the door. Pale with fright, They all stared at each other. Nobody was keen to answer the knock, so eventually They all went, including the dogs. Very cautiously, They opened the door, and saw nothing more alarming than poor Oliver, curled up in a sad little heap on the step.</div>
