<div class="line_en">You flipped open your notebook and ripped out a piece of paper. In tiny blue letters you wrote your address, the time, and your initials: C. C. You handed me the paper, said, "This is going to be great!" then gathered up your stuff and left.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ready?" Tyler said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“准备好了？”泰勒道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are friends," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们是朋友。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then someone called my name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时有人叫我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Part of me wanted to cry for being so right about her invitation. Instead, on the long walk back to my car, I started laughing. And I shouted into the trees, "What is going on?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一方面我想大哭，对她邀请动机的猜测竟然丝毫不差。可一路走回自己车时，我开始大笑。我对着树大叫：“这都怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Find another ride," I said. And I left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“找别人搭车吧。”我说着就走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He told me I was right about the party. "The party does suck."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说我说的对：“这个派对真的没劲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned forward, pretending someone had just told me the funniest joke in the world. Click.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我侧身向前，假装有谁刚刚讲了一个笑死人的笑话。咔嚓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then put down your drink," I said. "It's time for a picture."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那就放下你的饮料，”我说，“拍照了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I told them I was leaving because the party sucked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后我跟他们说我要走了，因为这派对一点没劲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyler aimed the camera and focused his lens, waiting for our beautiful, natural smiles. Courtney lowered the drink to her side. I put my arm around her waist and told her, "If you ever want to borrow anything from my dresser, Courtney, all you need to do is ask."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒摆弄着相机，对着焦距，等着我们灿烂、自然的笑容。考特妮垂下举杯的手，放到一边。我挽住她的腰，跟她说：“考特妮，你要是想借用我抽屉里的任何东西，尽管开口就是了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you want, Tyler?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么啦，泰勒？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Courtney begged me to stay. She told me to be reasonable. And maybe I was being a little insensitive. I mean, she wasn't ready to leave. How would she get home if her chauffeur didn't wait around for her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="考特妮恳求我留下。她要我通情达理一些。或许我是有点不近人情。我是说，她还没想走。要是她的司机不等她，她怎么回家呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Tyler. It doesn't," I said. Then I asked why he was following me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="错了，泰勒，这个派对不错。”我说。接着我问他干嘛跟着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that, I really started laughing. Not specifically at what he said, but at the absurdity of the whole night. Did he really have no clue that I knew about his night prowling -- about his nocturnal missions? Or did he sincerely hope I didn't know? Because as long as I didn't know, we could be friends, right?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听了真的开始大笑了起来。不只是因为他的话，而是因为整个晚上荒唐的一切。他真的一点儿都没怀疑我知道他的夜游——他的黑夜行动吗？还是他一心希望我一无所知？因为只要我不知道，我俩就能做朋友，是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His eyes dropped to his camera and he fiddled with the lens. He needed a ride home, he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他眼睛瞧着相机，摆弄着焦距。他要搭车回家，他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fine," I said. "But we're not stopping anywhere."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="请翻面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few times on the ride home he tried talking to me. But each time I cut him off. I did not want to act like everything was okay, because it wasn't.</div>
