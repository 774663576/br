<div class="line_en">Yet Robin often saw the King, and was quite near him many times. But whenever Richard came into the forest, Robin and his men used to hide. They thought that he would probably be very angry with them for killing his deer, and for taking so much money from the proud Norman nobles. So they kept out of the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day the King was complaining that he had never been able to see Robin. The Bishop of Hereford heard him, and said, "If you were only a Bishop, your Majesty, or even a plain monk, you might meet with him more often than you liked."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，国王在抱怨自己从来没能够见到罗宾汉。赫里福德城的主教听到了他的话，说道：“如果您只是一名主教，陛下，甚至只是一名普通的修道士，你可能会经常遇到他，你都不愿见到呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And because they honoured and loved the King himself, they would never have dreamed of stopping him, and of taking money away from him. Indeed Robin gave orders to his men to follow the King, if he should go to any dangerous part of the wood, so that they might protect him, and fight for him if necessary. For there were many other robbers in Sherwood who were wicked men, and not just and noble like Robin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，因为他们非常尊敬爱戴国王本人，所以从来没有梦想到要把他拦住，抢走他的钱。事实上，罗宾曾命令过他的伙伴们，如果国王到森林中危险的地方去，他们要跟随着他，以便能保护他，而且必要时为他而战。因为舍伍德森林中有许多其他的强盗，为人很坏，不像罗宾一样正直而高尚。">查看中文翻译</div>
