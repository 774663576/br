<div class="line_en">The rat squealed as he bit into it, squirming wildly in his hands, frantic to escape. The belly was the softest part. He tore at the sweet meat, the warm blood running over his lips. It was so good that it brought tears to his eyes. His belly rumbled and he swallowed. By the third bite the rat had ceased to struggle, and he was feeling almost content.</div>

<div class="line_en">At once he stilled, fearing even to chew. His mouth was full of blood and flesh and hair, but he dare not spit or swallow. He listened in terror, stiff as stone, to the scuff of boots and the clanking of iron keys. No, he thought, no, please gods, not now, not now. It had taken him so long to catch the rat. If they catch me with it, they will take it away, and then they'll tell, and Lord Ramsay will hurt me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他吓得立时僵住，不敢再嚼一口，满嘴的血肉皮毛既不能咽下又不能吐出。他心惊胆战地听着钥匙叮当作响，脚步踢踏而来。不要不要，他想，诸神慈悲现在不要。费九牛二虎之力才抓住的老鼠，被他们看到就没了，而且拉姆齐大人随后就要收拾我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew he ought to hide the rat, but he was so hungry. It had been two days since he had eaten, or maybe three. Down here in the dark it was hard to tell. Though his arms and legs were thin as reeds, his belly was swollen and hollow, and ached so much that he found he could not sleep. Whenever he closed his eyes, he found himself remembering Lady Hornwood. After their wedding, Lord Ramsay had locked her away in a tower and starved her to death. In the end she had eaten her own fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他早就知道该把老鼠藏起来，可是太饿了。上一顿饭大概是两天前，要么就是三天前，地底下这么黑，说不清楚。他的四肢细得好似芦苇杆；肚子鼓胀，肠胃空空。饥饿如此难忍，他发现自己居然还记得霍伍德夫人。拉姆齐大人与她完婚之后就把她锁进塔楼，活活饿死。最后她把自己的手指都吃了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He crouched down in a corner of his cell, clutching his prize under his chin. Blood ran from the corners of his mouth as he nibbled at the rat with what remained of his teeth, trying to bolt down as much of the warm flesh as he could before the cell was opened. The meat was stringy, but so rich he thought he might be sick. He chewed and swallowed, picking small bones from the holes in his gums where teeth had been yanked out. It hurt to chew, but he was so hungry he could not stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他缩到牢房的角落里，死死抓住自己的猎物。他决定竭尽所能地抓紧时间多吃些，于是猛撕狂吞，鲜血飞溅。肉不算细嫩，但是太丰盛，他担心自己会吃撑。嚼，咽，感受着细小的骨头在牙齿间碎裂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sounds were growing louder. Please gods, he isn't coming for me, he prayed, tearing off one of the rat's legs. It had been a long time since anyone had come for him. There were other cells, other prisoners. Sometimes he heard them screaming, even through the thick stone walls. The women always scream the loudest. He sucked at the raw meat and tried to spit out the leg bone, but it only dribbled over his lower lip and tangled in his beard. Go away, he prayed, go away, pass me by, please, please.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="声音越来越响，诸神保佑，但愿不是来找我。囚室不止这一间，囚犯也不止他一个。有时隔着厚重的石壁也能听到别人惨叫，叫声最吵的总是女人。他吸吮生鼠肉，剔出腿骨吐掉，但骨头从下唇滑落，缠进胡子里。走开，他祈祷，走开，放过我去别处吧，求你了，求你了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the footsteps stopped just when they were loudest, and the keys clattered right outside the door. The rat fell from his fingers. He wiped his bloody fingers on his breeches. "No," he mumbled, "noooo." His heels scrabbled at the straw as he tried to push himself into the corner, into the cold damp stone walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是脚步和钥匙的叮当声就停在了他门口，老鼠从他指间掉下。“不，”他咕哝着说，“不不不不不。”他用脚跟乱蹬地上的稻草，妄想找个墙缝挤进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Please," he squeaked, his voice thin and weak. He sounded a hundred years old. Perhaps he was. How long have I been in here?

<div class="line_en">He had run before. Years ago, it seemed, when he still had some strength in him, when he had still been defiant. That time it had been Kyra with the keys. She told him she had stolen them, that she knew a postern gate that was never guarded. "Take me back to Winterfell, m'lord," she begged, pale-faced and trembling. "I don't know the way. I can't escape alone. Come with me, please." And so he had. The gaoler was dead drunk in a puddle of wine, with his breeches down around his ankles. The dungeon door was open and the postern gate had been unguarded, just as she had said. They waited for the moon to go behind a cloud, then slipped from the castle and splashed across the Weeping Water, stumbling over stones, half-frozen by the icy stream. On the far side, he had kissed her. "You've saved us," he said. Fool. Fool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他以前跑过。几年前，当他还有些力量的时候，当他仍然反抗的时候。那一次是凯拉拿着钥匙。她告诉他，她偷了钥匙，她知道有一扇后门是从来不设防的。“带我回冬城去吧，大人，”她哀求道，脸色苍白，浑身发抖我不知道怎么走。“我一个人逃不掉。请跟我来。”他就这样做了。狱卒醉醺醺地躺在一滩酒里，裤子垂在脚踝上。地牢的门开着，后门也没人看守，正如她所说。他们等着月亮落在云朵后面，然后从城堡里溜了出来，溅起水花，跌跌撞撞地踩在被冰冷的小溪冻得半死的石头上。在另一边，他吻了她。“你救了我们，”他说。傻瓜。傻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had all been a trap, a game, a jape. Lord Ramsay loved the chase and preferred to hunt two-legged prey. All night they ran through the darkling wood, but as the sun came up the sound of a distant horn came faintly through the trees, and they heard the baying of a pack of hounds. "We should split up," he told Kyra as the dogs drew closer. "They cannot track us both." The girl was crazed with fear, though, and refused to leave his side, even when he swore that he would raise a host of ironborn and come back for her if she should be the one they followed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Within the hour, they were taken. One dog knocked him to the ground, and a second bit Kyra on the leg as she scrambled up a hillside. The rest surrounded them, baying and snarling, snapping at them every time they moved, holding them there until Ramsay Snow rode up with his hunts-men. He was still a bastard then, not yet a Bolton. "There you are," he said, smiling down at them from the saddle. "You wound me, wandering off like this. Have you grown tired of my hospitality so soon?" That was when Kyra seized a stone and threw it at his head. It missed by a good foot, and Ramsay smiled. "You must be punished."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到一小时，他们就被抓住了。一条狗把他扑倒在地，凯拉爬上山坡时，第二只狗咬了她的腿。其余的人围着他们，吼叫着，咆哮着，每次他们移动的时候都会对他们猛咬一顿，把他们关在那里，直到拉姆齐·斯诺和他的猎手们骑马过来。他那时还是个混蛋，还不是博尔顿人。“你在这儿，”他说，从马鞍上朝他们微笑着你惹怒了我，像这样游荡。我这么好客，你这么快就厌倦了吗？”这时凯拉抓起一块石头朝他的头扔去。差一点点就扔到，拉姆齐笑了。“你必须受到惩罚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Reek must remember that. And his name, he must remember his name.

<div class="line_en">Out in the yard, night was settling over the Dreadfort and a full moon was rising over the castle's eastern walls. Its pale light cast the shadows of the tall triangular merlons across the frozen ground, a line of sharp black teeth. The air was cold and damp and full of half-forgotten smells. The world, Reek told himself, this is what the world smells like. He did not know how long he had been down there in the dungeons, but it had to have been half a year at least. That long, or longer. What if it has been five years, or ten, or twenty? Would I even know? What if I went mad down there, and half my life is gone? But no, that was folly. It could not have been so long. The boys were still boys. If it had been ten years, they would have grown into men. He had to remember that. I must not let him drive me mad. He can take my fingers and my toes, he can put out my eyes and slice my ears off, but he cannot take my wits unless I let him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Little Walder led the way with torch in hand. Reek followed meekly, with Big Walder just behind him. The dogs in the kennels barked as they went by. Wind swirled through the yard, cutting through the thin cloth of the filthy rags he wore and raising gooseprickles on his skin. The night air was cold and damp, but he saw no sign of snow though surely winter was close at hand. Reek wondered if he would be alive to see the snows come. How many fingers will I have? How many toes? When he raised a hand, he was shocked to see how white it was, how fleshless. Skin and bones, he thought. I have an old man's hands. Could he have been wrong about the boys? What if they were not Little Walder and Big Walder after all, but the sons of the boys he'd known?</div>

<div class="line_en">The great hall was dim and smoky. Rows of torches burned to left and right, grasped by skeletal human hands jutting from the walls. High overhead were wooden rafters black from smoke, and a vaulted ceiling lost in shadow. The air was heavy with the smells of wine and ale and roasted meat. Reek's stomach rumbled noisily at the scents, and his mouth began to water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅里光线昏暗，烟气缭绕。墙上两行骷髅手臂分列左右，支撑着燃烧的火炬。头上高处是熏黑的椽木，穹顶隐没在阴影中。空气里满是果酒麦酒和烤肉的香气，勾引得臭佬肠胃咕噜作响，满口流涎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Little Walder pushed him stumbling past the long tables where the men of the garrison were eating. He could feel their eyes upon him. The best places, up near the dais, were occupied by Ramsay's favorites, the Bastard's Boys. Ben Bones, the old man who kept his lordship's beloved hunting hounds. Damon, called Damon Dance-for-Me, fair-haired and boyish. Grunt, who had lost his tongue for speaking carelessly in Lord Roose's hearing. Sour Alyn. Skinner. Yellow Dick. Farther down, below the salt, were others that Reek knew by sight if not by name: sworn swords and serjeants, soldiers and gaolers and torturers. But there were strangers too, faces he did not know. Some wrinkled their noses as he passed, whilst others laughed at the sight of him. Guests, Reek thought, his lordship's friends, and I am brought up to amuse them. A shiver of fear went through him.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the high table the Bastard of Bolton sat in his lord father's seat, drinking from his father's cup. Two old men shared the high table with him, and Reek knew at a glance that both were lords. One was gaunt, with flinty eyes, a long white beard, and a face as hard as a winter frost. His jerkin was a ragged bearskin, worn and greasy. Underneath he wore a ringmail byrnie, even at table. The second lord was thin as well, but twisted where the first was straight. One of his shoulders was much higher than the other, and he stooped over his trencher like a vulture over carrion. His eyes were grey and greedy, his teeth yellow, his forked beard a tangle of snow and silver. Only a few wisps of white hair still clung to his spotted skull, but the cloak he wore was soft and fine, grey wool trimmed with black sable and fastened at the shoulder with a starburst wrought in beaten silver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高桌上，波顿的私生子坐着他父亲大人的位子，正用他父亲的杯子喝酒。桌上还有两位老人，臭佬瞥一眼就看出两人都是领主。其中一位，外罩久穿油腻的破烂熊皮上衣，内着连环锁子甲，全不顾此时正在酒宴上；身材干瘦，目光冷峻，长须胜雪，面寒似霜。另一位也同样瘦，但是身形扭曲：一肩高、一肩低，躬腰驼背就餐的姿势好似秃鹫享用腐尸；黄板牙、灰眼珠，眼里透着贪婪，分岔的胡须交杂银灰，布满老人斑的秃头上只剩一小绺白发。但他穿的披风质料上乘，黑貂皮饰灰羊毛，用錾银芒星纽别在肩上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ramsay was clad in black and pink -- black boots, black belt and scabbard, black leather jerkin over a pink velvet doublet slashed with dark red satin. In his right ear gleamed a garnet cut in the shape of a drop of blood. Yet for all the splendor of his garb, he remained an ugly man, big-boned and slope-shouldered, with a fleshiness to him that suggested that in later life he would run to fat. His skin was pink and blotchy, his nose broad, his mouth small, his hair long and dark and dry. His lips were wide and meaty, but the thing men noticed first about him were his eyes. He had his lord father's eyes -- small, close-set, queerly pale. Ghost grey, some men called the shade, but in truth his eyes were all but colorless, like two chips of dirty ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆齐自己是一身黑色与粉色装扮：黑靴子，黑腰带，黑刀鞘，黑皮外套；内穿粉色天鹅绒上衣，有意撕裂的部分用暗红绸缎补齐（狂汗，不愧是剥皮人）。右耳戴一颗雕琢成血滴形状的石榴石坠，微微发亮。尽管打扮得光鲜漂亮，但是他依旧是个丑陋的人。大骨架，削肩膀，身上的赘肉显示他后半生会越来越肥；粉皮肤多疱，蒜头鼻子，小嘴巴，灰暗长发如枯草，肥厚嘴唇似香肠；不过，他身上最引人注目的部分是眼睛。他的两只眼睛跟他的领主老爹一样：小，瞳距近，呈特异的灰色。有人称之为幽灵灰[注]，但事实上，这双眼睛近乎无色，就像两片肮脏的冰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. No, my lord, I swear." Reek had tried to bite his own ring finger off once, to stop it hurting after they had stripped the skin from it. Lord Ramsay would never simply cut off a man's finger. He preferred to flay it and let the exposed flesh dry and crack and fester. Reek had been whipped and racked and cut, but there was no pain half so excruciating as the pain that followed flaying. It was the sort of pain that drove men mad, and it could not be endured for long. Soon or late the victim would scream, "Please, no more, no more, stop it hurting, cut it off," and Lord Ramsay would oblige. It was a game they played. Reek had learned the rules, as his hands and feet could testify, but that one time he had forgotten and tried to end the pain himself, with his teeth. Ramsay had not been pleased, and the offense had cost Reek another toe. "I ate a rat," he mumbled.</div>

Thus far he had lost two fingers off his left hand and the pinky off his right, but only the little toe off his right foot against three from his left.
