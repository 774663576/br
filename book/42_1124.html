<div class="line_en">Mrs. Gladys Tennyson was wearing just her nightgown and robe as she came running down the street after Sam.

So it was quite surprising to the people of Green Lake to see her running past them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley and Zero slept off and on for the next two days, ate onions, all they wanted, and splashed dirty water into their mouths. In the late afternoon Big Thumb gave them shade. Stanley tried to make the hole deeper, but he really needed the shovel. His efforts just seemed to stir up the mud and make the water dirtier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利和零蛋接连昏睡了两天，他们吃吃洋葱，往嘴里随意地拨拉了点脏水。到了傍晚，大拇指就成了他们乘凉的好地方。斯坦利想把洞挖深一些，但真需要有铲子。他现在的努力只会搅浑烂泥，让水更混浊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero was sleeping. He was still very sick and weak, but the sleep and the onions seemed to be doing him some good. Stanley was no longer afraid that he would die soon. Still, he didn't want to go for the shovel while Zero was asleep. He didn't want him to wake up and think he'd been deserted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋还在睡。他仍然虚弱而憔悴，但睡眠和洋葱似乎让他好点了。斯坦利不再担心零蛋会很快死掉了，但他不想在零蛋没醒来之前去找铲子。他不想让零蛋醒来后认为自己被抛弃了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was fairly easy to follow the trail he had made two days earlier. There were a few places where he wasn't sure he was going the right way, but it just took a little bit of searching before he found the trail again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着两天前的足迹，他走得很轻松。有些地方他不太确定是否走对了，但只要花一点时间就又找到了足迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still, he headed downward, just in case. He came to a bare spot between two large patches of weeds and sat down to rest. Now he had definitely gone too far, he decided. He was tired out from walking down the hill. It would have been impossible to have carried Zero up the hill from here, especially after walking all day with no food or water. The shovel must be buried in some weeds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续往下走，以防铲子掉到下面去了。他来到两丛杂草之间的空地上，坐下休息了一会儿。他认定还是不能走得太远。这一路下来，他累得不行。把零蛋从这里背上山是不可能的，特别是在没有食物没有水赶了一整天路之后。铲子肯定被埋在草丛里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went quite a ways down the mountain but still didn't find the shovel. He looked back up toward the top of the mountain. He must have walked right past it, he thought. There was no way he could have carried Zero all the way up from here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走了好几条路还是没有找到铲子。他回头看了看上山的路。他肯定走过这段路，但似乎不可能背着零蛋从这儿一路上山。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before starting back up, he took one last look around in all directions. He saw a large indentation in the weeds a little farther down the mountain. It didn't seem likely that the shovel could be there, but he'd already come this far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回山上之前，他最后一次朝四周望了望。他看到下面不远处的草丛里陷下去好大一片地方。铲子似乎不太可能在那儿，但是他还是要下去看看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On his way back up the mountain, Stanley had to sit down and rest several times. It was a long, hard climb.</div>

<div class="line_en">There, lying in some tall weeds, he found the shovel and the sack of jars. He was amazed. He wondered if the shovel and sack might have rolled down the hill. But none of the jars were broken, except the one which had broken earlier. And if they had rolled down the hill, it is doubtful that he would have found the sack and shovel side by side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那片高高的杂草中，他找到了铲子和装着罐子的麻袋。他兴奋极了。莫非是铲子和袋子自己滚下山的？可是除了之前就已经碎掉的罐子外，其余罐子都完好无损。如果它们真的滚下了山，那就不可能还在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
