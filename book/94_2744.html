<div class="line_en">Perhaps the most curious of all the curious creatures in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, even by Granny's yardstick, are the regretters. They are wild animals living in herds, whose grazing areas are just outside Miamas, where they forage widely, and really nobody knows how they survive, considering the circumstances. At first sight, regretters look more or less like white horses, although they are far more ambivalent and suffer from the biological defect of never being able to make up their minds. This obviously causes certain practical problems, because regretters are flock animals, and one regretter therefore almost always crashes into another when heading off in one direction and then changing its mind. For this reason regretters always have enormous, oblong swellings on their foreheads, which, in various fairy tales from Miamas that have ended up in the real world, has made people consistently get them confused with unicorns. But in Miamas the storytellers learned the hard way not to cut costs by hiring a regretter to do the job of a unicorn, because, whenever they did, the fairy tales had a tendency never to get to the point. And also no one, really no one at all, feels good after standing behind a regretter in the line for the lunch buffet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mum is massaging her temples and swearing repeatedly through gritted teeth. She is obviously regretting speeding away from the hospital like that, since the first thing she has to do after dropping Elsa off at school is drive straight back to the hospital so she can go to work. Elsa pats her on the shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈按摩着她的太阳穴，反反复复咬牙切齿地骂骂咧咧。她明显是后悔那样从医院跑掉，因为把爱莎送到学校之后，她就不得不第一时间开车回医院上班。爱莎拍拍她的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mum shuts her eyes in resignation. She's had rather too much baby brain lately. So much so that she could not even find Elsa's Gryffindor scarf when they looked for it this morning, and so much so that she keeps putting her telephone in strange places. In the refrigerator and in the trash bin and the laundry basket and on one occasion in George's jogging shoes. This morning Elsa had to call Mum's telephone three times, which is not entirely uncomplicated as the display on Elsa's telephone is quite fuzzy after its encounter with the toaster. But in the end they found Mum's telephone ringing inside Elsa's backpack. The Gryffindor scarf was also there.</div>

She hopes so.</div>

When she's got to seven, Kia screeches back into the parking area and Mum, slightly out of breath, winds down the window. Elsa gives her the phone. Mum mumbles, "It's my baby brain." Elsa kisses her on the cheek.</div>

I CAN MANAGE IT! Elsa knows this is how they talk about her. She is something that needs to be "picked up" or "sorted." Like doing the laundry. She knows they mean no harm by it, but come on! No seven-year-old who has seen films about the Italian Mafia wants to be "sorted" by her family.</div>

<div class="line_en">She turns around and looks into the playground. No one has seen her yet. She reaches into her backpack and gets out the letter she found in Renault. She doesn't recognize the address, and Granny was always terrible at giving directions. Elsa isn't even sure this address exists in real life, because quite often when Granny was explaining where things were, she used landmarks that were no longer there. "It's right by where those morons with the budgerigars lived, past the old tennis club down where the old rubber factory or whatever it was used to be," she'd ramble on, and when people didn't get exactly what she was talking about, Granny got so frustrated that she had to smoke two cigarettes one after the other, lighting the second by the embers of the first. And then when someone said she couldn't do that indoors, she got so angry that it was utterly impossible after that to get any decent directions out of her, impossible in fact to get anything except her expletive middle finger.</div>

It's her new favorite place on earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alf opens the door after the seventh ring. His flat smells of wood shavings. He's wearing a sorry excuse for a dressing gown, and the remaining hairs on his head look like the last tottering bits of buildings after a hurricane. He's holding a large white cup on which it says "Juventus" and there's a smell of coffee, strong like Granny always drank it. "After Alf has made coffee, you have to drive standing up all morning," she used to say, and Elsa didn't quite know what she meant, although she understood what she was saying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔夫在门铃响了七声之后开门。他的公寓闻上去有股木屑的气味。他穿着一条很烂的睡袍，脑袋上仅剩的头发看起来像飓风过后摇摇欲坠的建筑残骸。他手捧一个白色大杯子，上面印着“尤文图斯”，闻上去一股浓烈的咖啡味，像外婆常喝的那种。“阿尔夫煮的咖啡会让你整个早上不得不站着开车。”她以前这么说过，爱莎不太明白她的意思，但听得懂她说的句子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wurse is lying on its side with two legs comfortably stretched up into the air when Elsa walks into the storage unit, as if it has very gravely misunderstood a Pilates exercise. The Monster is standing in the passage outside, rubbing his hands. He looks very uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎走进储藏室时，呜嘶正侧躺在地上，双腿舒舒服服地朝上伸展，像在做普拉提（虽然它对普拉提这项运动有很严重的误解）。怪物站在外面的走廊上，搓着手，看上去很不自在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Monster nods. The hood glides away a few inches from his face, and the big scar gleams momentarily in the fluorescent light. He doesn't even ask where they're going. It's difficult not to feel a pang of affection for him.</div>

She knows that Mum is going to be angry with her for playing hooky and going off without permission, but when Elsa asks her why she's always so worried about her, Mum always says, "Because I'm so bloody afraid something may happen to you." But Elsa is having a pretty hard time thinking that anything can happen to you when you have a monster and a wurse tagging along. So she feels it should be okay, given the circumstances.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶走出储藏室时想要舔怪物。怪物惊恐地跳了起来，猛地收回手，抓起一把扫帚，紧靠着另一间储藏室。呜嘶似乎在故意捉弄他，淘气地来回吐着舌头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"CUT IT OUT, I SAID!" Elsa roars, throwing her little body right between the two furious creatures, unprotected between claws as sharp as spears and fists probably big enough to separate her head from her shoulders. She stands her ground, armed with nothing but the indifference of an almost-eight-year-old to her own physical shortcomings. Which goes a long way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我、说、别、再、闹、了！”爱莎咆哮着，用她小小的身躯挡在两只愤怒的生物之间——一边是长矛般锋利的爪子，一边是大得可以把她的脑袋从肩上扯下来的拳头。她毫无防御却坚守阵地，无视自己不到八岁的柔弱体格，也没有任何武器。这一举动很奏效。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The idea here is that you're supposed to protect me," Elsa says in a quieter voice, trying not to cry, which doesn't go so terrifically well. "I've never had any friends and now you two try to kill the only two I've ever had, just after I've found you!"</div>
