<div class="line_en">My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me. At first, I have no idea what she's pointing to, but then, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of… of what? Some sort of animal? It looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, swaying ever so slightly. There's something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum. Then I know. It's a wasp nest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep still. After all, I don't know what kind of wasp lives there. It could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-we'll-leave-you-alone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isn't the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitol's muttations, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land mines, around the districts during the war. Larger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a sting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact. Most people can't tolerate more than a few stings. Some die at once. If you live, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness. And there's another thing, these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them. That's where the tracker part of the name comes from.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不由得打了个寒战，但却尽力让自己保持镇静。不管怎样，我不清楚在这一区域生活的是哪种黄蜂。也许是平常的那种，你不惹它，它也不惹你。可饥饿游戏进行期间，在竞技场投放平常的品种不符合游戏的通常做法。也许这是凯匹特培育出的像叽喳鸟一样的特殊杂交品种，叫做“追踪黄蜂”。这些杀人黄蜂在实验室培育出来，之后在林中放养，战争时像地雷一样投放到其他辖区。这些黄蜂的个头比普通黄蜂大，通体金黄色，人一旦被蜇，起的包有李子那么大。多数人蜇几下就一命呜呼了，即使活下来，毒液使人产生幻觉而发狂。还有，这些黄蜂会围攻任何破坏它们的蜂巢或企图杀死它们的人，这就是为什么它叫“追踪黄蜂”的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Given my circumstances, I guess it doesn't matter what type of wasp nest it is. I'm wounded and trapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. There's no way they could do otherwise after I've made them look so stupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If I can drop it down on them, I may be able to escape. But I'll risk my life in the process.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鉴于我目前的处境，我想这是什么蜂也没太大关系吧，因为我已经受伤，又被困在这里。夜晚为我带来了暂时的安宁，可太阳出来时，这些职业选手会想法杀死我，在遭到如此嘲弄之后他们必定会报复。蜂巢是我拥有的最后选择。如果我能把它扔到他们头上，我也许能逃脱，可我也要冒失去生命的危险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city, but the ones near the districts were left untouched. Another reminder of our weakness, I suppose, just like the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the fence of District 12. When Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上次战争结束后，凯匹特毁掉了城市周围所有的蜂巢，但郊区的还保留着，在十二区围障外的林子里也有。凯匹特保留这些黄蜂，如同饥饿游戏，是为了提醒其下属辖区的人他们是多么的不堪一击。每当我和盖尔在林中看到“追踪黄蜂”时，我们会朝相反的方向快速离开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, I'll never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest to cut it free. I'll have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down. The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that. But can my hands? And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And what if the Careers figure out what I'm doing and move their camp? That would defeat the whole purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，我不会挨近蜂巢把它割掉。我需要把整个树枝锯掉，我刀上的锯齿应该可以办到。可我的手行吗？锯树枝时引起的震动会不会惊动蜂群？要是它们发觉我的意图飞走又该怎么办？那整个计划就泡汤了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out. It's now or never, I think, and begin to saw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯匹特市徽在头上闪亮，国歌也响起来了。“要么现在，要么永远就没机会了。”我思忖着，之后开始锯树枝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I realize that the best chance I'll have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during the anthem. That could begin any time. I drag myself out of my bag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the tree. This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I reach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes more distinctive. But it's still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers. It's the smoke, I think. It's sedated them. This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想锯树枝而不引起注意的最佳时机是在奏响国歌的时候，国歌随时都会响起。我从睡袋里爬出来，摸摸别在腰里的刀，硬硬的还在，我开始往树上爬。这么做本身就很危险，因为树枝已经很细，连我都难以支撑，可我仍继续爬。我爬到挂着蜂巢的树枝时，蜂鸣就听得更清楚了。但很奇怪，追踪蜂的声音应该更大些。“可能是烟雾的缘故。”我想，“烟雾使它们安静下来。”这也是以前我们对付黄蜂的办法之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Blisters burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once I've got a groove, the work requires less effort but is almost more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and saw away, occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today. That's all right. The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me. But the anthem's running out and I'm only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends, the sky goes dark, and I'm forced to stop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我吃力地来回锯着树枝，右手上的水疱都破了。我锯下一道沟，本来应该继续锯，可我却有些支持不住了。我咬紧牙关坚持着，边不时地看看天空，今天没有死亡。很好。观众会看到我受伤了，爬到树上，背包在身下。但国歌很快就要奏完了，当国歌停止时，我只锯掉了四分之三。天空一片漆黑，我不得不停下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the faint light of the Careers' torches, I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise I've ever had. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that it's medicine. Cautiously, I probe the surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="借着职业选手的火炬射来的微弱光线，我一点一点下到我栖身的树杈，却得到了一个最大的惊喜。拴在银色降落伞上的一个塑料瓶正静静地躺在我的睡袋上。赞助者的第一份礼物！黑密斯一定是让他们在奏国歌时送来的。这小瓶正好可以放在我手掌上，会是什么呢？我拧开盖子，从气味就知道是药。我小心地用指尖抹着药膏，手指尖立刻不疼了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the wasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape, this could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, I think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在怎么办？我也许可以凭感觉把树锯断，可这不是最聪明的做法。如果黄蜂已经熏晕了怎么办？如果蜂巢掉落的时候卡在树枝上怎么办？或者我现在逃跑？都是在浪费时间。最好，我想，就是明天清晨偷偷爬上来，然后再把蜂巢锯掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, Haymitch," I whisper. "Thank you." He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is priceless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，黑密斯，”我轻轻说道，“谢谢你。”他没有抛弃我，让我孤立无援，孤军奋战。这药一定贵极了，也许不是一个，而是很多赞助者愿意为我买这一小瓶药。对我来说，这是无价之宝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants, it's high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol's labs. When my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, it's all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把俩指头伸进药瓶，把药膏抹在小腿上。药膏具有神奇的魔力，一接触皮肤疼痛即刻消失，还感觉凉丝丝的。这不是妈妈用草药碾碎做的那种药，而是在凯匹特实验室研制的高科技产物。抹完小腿，我在手上也抹了薄薄的一层。我把小瓶卷在降落伞里，安全地蜷缩在睡袋里。现在疼痛已经减轻了，我可以好好休息一下了，我很快沉入了梦乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear. Whatever happens, I'm going to have to move and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water. Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and I'm already starting to feel the effects of hunger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一只鸟落在几英尺远的树枝上，啾啾的叫声把我从梦中惊醒，又是一个清晨。我检查一下自己的手，已经从灼烧的深红变成了婴儿皮肤的浅红。我的腿仍感到火辣辣的，烧伤要比手厉害得多。我又上了点药，然后赶紧收拾东西。无论发生什么，我都要离开，尽快离开。我吃了点饼干，一块牛肉干，喝了几口水。昨天我的胃里几乎是空的，此时我已经饿得浑身无力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Below me, I can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground. By her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree, I'd guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在树下，我看到职业选手和皮塔一伙睡在地上。格丽默斜倚在树上，从她的位置判断，她正在值班，可看得出，她也非常困乏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but I can't make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if I'm going to die today, it's Rue I want to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我透过树枝观察旁边的露露，却看不见她。她昨天给我提示，所以今天给她发出警报也公平。再说了，如果我今天就死去的话，我也希望露露赢，就算我家人得到的食物少些。让皮塔赢得比赛并戴上桂冠，真是令我难以忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I call Rue's name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, wide and alert, at once. She points up to the nest again. I hold up my knife and make a sawing motion. She nods and disappears. There's a rustling in a nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit farther off. I realize she's leaping from tree to tree. It's all I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she showed the Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor. She should have gotten at least a ten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我轻声呼唤着露露的名字，她惊奇的大大的眼睛立刻从树叶中露出来。她又指了指上面的蜂巢。我拿起刀，做了一个锯掉的动作。她点点头，然后就消失在浓密的树叶里。附近的树上发出簌簌的声音，之后稍远的地方出现同样的声音，我意识到她是从一棵树跳到另一棵树上。我强忍着才没有大笑出来。这就是她向大赛组织者展示的本领吗？我脑子里出现了她在训练中心的器材上飞转腾挪、脚不沾地的敏捷身影。她至少应该得到十分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I can't afford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last night's climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb that holds the nest, I position the knife in the groove and I'm about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving. There, on the nest. The bright gold gleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface. No question, it's acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well. Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands, beading up through the ointment, and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt. If I don't get through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm could emerge and attack me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="东方已浮现出玫瑰色的霞光，我不能再等了。与昨晚的伤痛相比，这点小事算不了什么。我爬到挂蜂巢的树枝，把锯齿搁在昨天切的凹槽里，正要锯，却突然看到有东西在移动，原来，颜色鲜艳的追踪蜂正懒洋洋地从薄薄的灰色蜂巢里爬出来。没问题，黄蜂的动作是有些迟缓，但它在动，这也就是说其他的黄蜂很快也会出动。汗珠从我手心里渗出来，我尽量在衬衫上把手擦干。如果我不在几秒钟内把树枝锯掉，蜂群就会全部出动，并对我发起攻击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. Back, forth, back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them coming out. Back, forth, back, forth! A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I know one has found me and the others will be honing in. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife cuts through, I shove the end of the branch as far away from me as I can. It crashes down through the lower branches, snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground. The nest bursts open like an egg, and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拖延片刻也毫无意义。我深吸了一口气，抓住刀柄，使出最大的力气锯着。前，后，前，后！黄蜂嗡嗡地叫着，我听到它们已经出动。后，前，后，前！我的膝盖突然感到一阵刺痛，我知道有一个黄蜂已经发现了我，其他的也会随之而至。后，前，后，前！树枝一锯断，我就抓住树枝的末端，使足力气把它推向远处。树枝噼里啪啦地向下掉落，挂在一些小树枝上，翻转几下，最后砰的一声落在地上。蜂巢像鸡蛋一样裂开，被激怒的黄蜂疯狂地在空中飞舞着。">查看中文翻译</div>

The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale tracker jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt. I can hear cries of "To the lake! To the lake!" and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water. It must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from District 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before they're even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go completely mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless. She calls to the others for help but, of course, no one returns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight, although I wouldn't bet on her making it to the lake. I watch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes, and then go still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次进攻目标明确。那伙人从睡梦中醒来，遭到的却是追踪蜂的全面进攻。皮塔和其他几个人反应较快，他们丢弃一切，夺路而逃。我听到有人在喊：“往湖边跑，往湖边跑！”他们想跳到水里躲避黄蜂，可他们想把愤怒的黄蜂甩在后面可不容易。格丽默和另一个四区的女孩可就没那么幸运了，她们还没跑出我的视线，就被蜇了好多次。格丽默好像完全疯了，她尖叫着想用手里的弓箭把黄蜂赶走，可一点用也没有。她向其他人大呼救命，当然没人回头。四区的女孩踉踉跄跄地往前跑，我不肯定她能否跑到湖边。我看到格丽默倒下了，在地上歇斯底里地翻滚了几分钟，之后就不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others. I don't think they'll return, but I don't want to risk it. I scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake. The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water, just in case any wasps are still on my trail. After about five minutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings. Actually, the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. A foul-smelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers.</div>

The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green liquid around her. I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow.

Breakfast must stay down, it might be days before I can hunt again. A second cannon fires and I'm guessing the girl from District 4 has just died. I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I think it's for Glimmer, although this doesn't quite make sense because I'm still in the picture, still fighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In the middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw myself over Glimmer's body as if to protect it but then I see the girl from District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一切都是真的吗？还是我开始产生幻觉？我闭上眼睛，用力呼吸，命令自己不要呕吐。早饭一定要留在肚子里，下次捕猎也许距现在还要几天时间。第二次鸣炮，我想四区的女孩肯定也完了。我听到鸟叫停止，一只鸟发出警告，直升机就要出现了。我感到迷惑不解，直升机应该是来带走格丽默的，可此时我还在画面里，正拼命要拿到箭。我歪歪斜斜地跪起来，突然感到天旋地转，在半空，我看到了直升机。我扑到格丽默的身上，想保护弓箭，但这时我看到直升机抓起四区的女孩，飞到空中，很快消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do this!" I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig my hands under Glimmer's body, get a hold on what must be her rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. I can't help it, I'm hyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and I'm losing my grasp on what's real. I tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but it's caught on something, her shoulder blade, something, and finally yank it free. I've just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, several pairs, coming through the underbrush, and I realize the Careers have come back. They've come back to kill me or get their weapons or both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么办！”我命令自己。我咬紧牙关，把手伸到格丽默的身下，抓住了一样东西，应该是她的胸廓，我把它往上推到她胃的位置。我已无法控制自己，呼吸很急促，这噩梦般的经历让我觉得周围的一切都很不真实。我抓到了箭袋，可是它被什么东西绊住了，是她肩上的箭或别的什么。我最后终于把它拽了出来。刚把箭袋抱在怀里，就听到林子里传来嘈杂的脚步声，我意识到是职业选手返回来了。他们返回来杀我或拿走武器，或二者皆是。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on Peeta's face makes no sense to me. I wait for the blow. Instead his arm drops to his side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已全然无助，第一个杀手已经从林子里跑出来，手里拿着矛，准备投向我。皮塔脸上惊异的表情对我没有任何触动，我等着他们的攻击。皮塔没有攻击，而是垂下了手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you still doing here?" he hisses at me. I stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear. His whole body starts sparkling as if he's been dipped in dew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你还待在这里干什么？”他低声对我说。我吃惊而不解地盯着他，汗珠从他耳朵下面蜇伤的大包上滑落。他的浑身透湿，闪闪发光，好像刚浸泡在晨露里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you mad?" He's prodding me with the shaft of the spear now."Get up! Get up!"</div>

<div class="line_en">I rise, but he's still pushing at me. What? What is going on? He shoves me away from him hard. "Run!" he screams. "Run!"</div>

<div class="line_en">But it's too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跑已经来不及了。我从箭袋里拿出一支黏乎乎的箭，想搭在弦上。可弓上不是一个弦而是三个弦，而且箭上的腐尸味太恶心了，我射不了，射不了，射不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. He's sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one eye. I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says. Holding tightly to my bow and arrows, banging into trees that appear out of nowhere, tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance. Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world begins to bend in alarming ways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在皮塔身后，加图在灌木丛里健步如飞。他也浑身湿透，一只眼睛下面被蜇了一个大包，手里的剑闪闪发光。我赶紧照皮塔的话跌跌撞撞地拼命奔跑。我手里紧握着弓箭，身体不稳，撞在树上摔倒，我爬起来，穿过池塘，跑进一片不熟悉的林子，周围的一切在我的眼里已经扭曲变形。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I can't shake them free. They're climbing up my arms, my neck. Someone's screaming, a long high-pitched scream that never breaks for breath. I have a vague idea it might be me. I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest. Tucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蝴蝶变成房子那么大，然后散出成千上万个星星，树木变成血液，在我的脚下颓然倾倒，蚂蚁从我手中的水泡里爬出来，无论我怎么甩都甩不掉，它们爬满我的胳膊、脖子，有一个人在不停歇地尖叫，在模糊的意识中，我觉得这个人就是我。我跌倒在一个小坑里，里面堆满了橘红色的泡泡，它们像蜂巢一样嗡嗡地响。我抱着膝盖缩成一团，等待死亡的降临。">查看中文翻译</div>
