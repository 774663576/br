<div class="line_en">Gravel flew from beneath his paws as he gained the last few feet to stand upon the crest. The sun hung above the tall pines huge and red, and below him the trees and hills went on and on as far as he could see or smell. A kite was circling far above, dark against the pink sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ridge slanted sharply from the earth, a long fold of stone and soil shaped like a claw. Trees clung to its lower slopes, pines and hawthorn and ash, but higher up the ground was bare, the ridgeline stark against the cloudy sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could feel the high stone calling him. Up he went, loping easy at first, then faster and higher, his strong legs eating up the incline. Birds burst from the branches overhead as he raced by, clawing and flapping their way into the sky. He could hear the wind sighing up amongst the leaves, the squirrels chittering to one another, even the sound a pinecone made as it tumbled to the forest floor. The smells were a song around him, a song that filled the good green world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山脊在呼唤他。他向上跑去，一开始是轻松漫步，随后越来越快，越跑越高，斜坡在他强健的腿下向后退去，鸟儿在他经过时从头顶树枝间飞散开来，一边挥舞爪子，一边扇动翅膀，逃往空中。他听见清风在树叶间叹息，听见松鼠唧唧喳喳地耳语，甚至还听见松果翻滚落地的声响。无数鲜活的气味则象一首歌谣，环绕着他，歌颂美好的绿色世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Prince. The man-sound came into his head suddenly, yet he could feel the rightness of it. Prince of the green, prince of the wolfswood. He was strong and swift and fierce, and all that lived in the good green world went in fear of him.</div>

He could not smell them, nor hear their howls by night, yet he felt their presence at his back… all but the sister they had lost. His tail drooped when he remembered her. Four now, not five.

<div class="line_en">He had a pack as well, once. Five they had been, and a sixth who stood aside. Somewhere down inside him were the sounds the men had given them to tell one from the other, but it was not by their sounds he knew them. He remembered their scents, his brothers and his sisters. They all had smelled alike, had smelled of pack, but each was different too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也有过一个族群，如今已找不到了。六狼一体，五狼残存，分割天涯，互不联络。在他内心残留着声音的印象，那是人类赋予他兄弟姐妹们的名字，但他不是通过声音来辨认他们的。他记得气味，他们有相似的气味，同一族群的气味，虽然每一个又各不相同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Far below, at the base of the woods, something moved amongst the trees. A flash of grey, quick-glimpsed and gone again, but it was enough to make his ears prick up.

Now the prince could see more of them, shadows on fleet grey paws. A pack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下方远处，林间有什么东西移动。只瞥见灰影一闪，然后又迅速消失，他不禁竖起耳朵。水流湍急的绿溪边，又一条身影掠过。是狼，他知道，是他的小个子远亲们，正在打猎。王子看到更多形体，敏捷的灰爪子影影绰绰。他们是一个族群。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The deer was down and dying when he reached her, ringed by eight of his small grey cousins. The heads of the pack had begun to feed, the male first and then his female, taking turns tearing flesh from the red underbelly of their prey. The others waited patiently, all but the tail, who paced in a wary circle a few strides from the rest, his own tail tucked low. He would eat the last of all, whatever his brothers left him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Deer, and fear, and blood. The scent of prey woke the hunger in him. The prince sniffed the air again, turning, and then he was off, bounding along the ridgetop with jaws half-parted. The far side of the ridge was steeper than the one he'd come up, but he flew surefoot over stones and roots and rotting leaves, down the slope and through the trees, long strides eating up the ground. The scent pulled him onward, ever faster.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="王子处在下风，他们没有闻出来，直到他跳上坠落的圆木，离死鹿仅六步之遥。小尾巴头一个发现他，可怜地呜咽了一声，便悄悄溜走。除了领头的雄性和雌性，族群里的狼转身龇牙咆哮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The direwolf answered the snarls with a low warning growl and showed them his own teeth.

<div class="line_en">And then there was only the head wolf to face, the great grey male with his bloody muzzle fresh from the prey's soft belly. There was white on his muzzle as well, to mark him as an old wolf, but when his mouth opened, red slaver ran from his teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Long they fought, rolling together over roots and stones and fallen leaves and the scattered entrails of the prey, tearing at each other with tooth and claw, breaking apart, circling each round the other, and bolting in to fight again. The prince was larger, and much the stronger, but his cousin had a pack. The female prowled around them closely, snuffing and snarling, and would interpose herself whenever her mate broke off bloodied. From time to time the other wolves would dart in as well, to snap at a leg or an ear when the prince was turned the other way. One angered him so much that he whirled in a black fury and tore out the attacker's throat. After that the others kept their distance.</div>

<div class="line_en">The prince sniffed at him and licked the blood from fur and tom flesh. When the old wolf gave a soft whimper, the direwolf turned away. He was very hungry now, and the prey was his.</div>

It was a queer wind that blew only in his ears. He buried his jaws in the deer's belly and tore off a mouthful of flesh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突如其来的喊声令他停下来吼叫。狼群用绿色和黄色的眼睛注视他，在白昼的余光中闪亮。他们不知所措。一阵怪异的风在他耳边轻响，他把爪子埋进鹿腹，撕下满满一大块肉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, he thought. No, I won't. It was a boy's thought, not a direwolf's. The woods were darkening all about him, until only the shadows of the trees remained, and the glow of his cousins' eyes.

At Winterfell, Old Nan had dubbed him "little grandfather."</div>

<div class="line_en">The woods and wolves were gone. Bran was back again, down in the damp vault of some ancient watchtower that must have been abandoned thousands of years before. It wasn't much of a tower now. Even the tumbled stones were so overgrown with moss and ivy that you could hardly see them until you were right on top of them.
