<div class="line_en">Hardly had de Villefort left the dining-room than he put off his joyful mask to take on the serious mien of one called upon to exercise the supreme office of pronouncing on the life of his fellow man. However, despite the mobility of his expression, something which the deputy had studied more than once, as a skilled actor does, in front of his mirror, on this occasion it was an effort for him to lower his brow and darken his features. In reality, apart from the memory of his father's choice of political allegiance (which, if he did not himself completely renounce it, might affect his own career), Gérard de Villefort was at that moment as happy as it is possible for a man to be. At the age of twenty-six, already wealthy in his own right, he held a high office in the legal profession; and he was to marry a beautiful young woman whom he loved, not with passion, but reasonably, as a deputy crown prosecutor may love. Apart from her beauty, which was exceptional, his fiancée, Mlle de Saint-Méran, belonged to a family which was among those most highly thought of at court in this time; and, besides the influence of her mother and father (who, having no other children, could reserve it entirely for their son-in-law), she was in addition bringing her husband a dowry of fifty thousand écus which, thanks to her "expectations" -- that dreadful word invented by marriage brokers -- might one day be increased by a legacy of half a million.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="因此，这一切因素综合起来，使维尔福得到了无限的幸福。所以，当维尔福略一回省，静心地默察他的内心生活的时候，他就好象望到太阳上的焦点似地目眩神迷起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the door, he found the police commissioner waiting for him. The sight of this sombre personage immediately brought him back from seventh heaven to the solid earth on which we all walk. He composed his features, as we mentioned, and approached the officer of the law: "Here I am, Monsieur. I have read the letter, and you did well to arrest this man. Now tell me everything you know about him and the conspiracy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福在门口遇到等候着他的警官。一见这位警官，他就从三重天又被拉回到地面上来了，于是他的脸部又装出我们先前形容过的那副神色，说：“那封信我念过了，先生，你办得很对，是应该把这个人逮捕起来。现在且告诉我，你有没有发现他和造反有关的情节。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As far as the conspiracy is concerned, Monsieur, we know nothing as yet. All the papers that we seized on him have been tied in a single bundle and deposited, sealed, on your desk.

<div class="line_en">As we have seen, Villefort belonged to the nobility of the town and M. Morrel to the plebeian part of it: the former was an extreme Royalist, the latter suspected of harbouring Bonapartist sympathies. Villefort looked contemptuously at Morrel and answered coldly: "You know, Monsieur, that one can be mild in one's private life, honest in one's business dealings and skilled in one's work, yet at the same time, politically speaking, be guilty of great crimes. You do know that, I suppose, Monsieur?"</div>

<div class="line_en">This restore to us had a revolutionary ring to the ears of the crown prosecutor's deputy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这“给我们”三个字在代理检察官的耳朵里听来很有些革命的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrel blushed, for his conscience was not altogether clear on the point of his political opinions. In any case, his mind was slightly troubled by the confidential information that Dantès had given him about his talk with the marshal and the few words that the emperor had addressed to him. However, he added in tones of the most urgent pleading: "I beg you, Monsieur de Villefort, be just, as it is your duty to be, and generous, as you always are, and soon restore poor Dantès to us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摩莱尔的脸红了，因为在政治方面，他的见解也并不十分明朗；此外，邓蒂斯所告诉他谒见大元帅的事，和圣上对他所说的那番话也更增加了他的困惑。但他还是用深切关怀的语气回答说：“维尔福先生，我求您还是象您一向那样公正仁慈，早些把他送回给我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He emphasized these last words, as if intending to apply them to the shipowner himself, while his enquiring look seemed to search right into the innermost soul of a man who had tried to intervene on behalf of another, when he should have realized that he was himself in need of indulgence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="代理检察官说这些话的语气很重，好象他想把这些话应用于船主本身，而他的眼光似乎直穿对方的心，象是说，你为旁人说情，你应该知道你本人也得需要饶恕呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, well!" he muttered to himself. "To us… Can this Dantès be a member of some sect of carbonari, for his protector to employ that collective expression without being aware that he was doing so? I seem to understand from the commissioner that he was arrested in a cabaret, and he added, in a large gathering: this was some kind of vente."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唔，唔！”他默念道，“难道邓蒂斯是烧炭党①的一分子，所以他的保护人要用这种同生共死的态度来求情吗？我记得，他是在一个酒家被捕的，有许多人同在一起。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Upon that, having arrived at the door of his house, which backed on to the law courts, he stepped majestically inside, after giving an icy bow to the unhappy shipowner, who remained as if rooted to the spot where Villefort had left him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这时已走到他自己的家门口，他的家就在法庭隔壁，他用冷冰冰的态度向船主行了一个礼后就进去了，只留下后者象化石似的呆立在维尔福离开他的那个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Villefort crossed the anteroom, gave a sidelong glance in the direction of Dantès and, taking a dossier that was handed to him by one of the officers, vanished, saying: "Let the prisoner be brought in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福穿过外客厅，向邓蒂斯瞥了一眼，从一个宪兵手里接过一包东西，一面走进去，一面说：“把犯人带进来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The anteroom was full of gendarmes and police officers; and in the midst of them, under close arrest, surrounded by faces burning with hatred, the prisoner stood, calm and motionless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外客厅里挤满了警察局和宪兵司令部派来的人，在他们中间，站着那个犯人，他虽然被严加看管，却仍很镇定，而且还带着微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Swift though it was, the glance had been enough to give Villefort an idea of the man whom he would have to question: he had recognized intelligence in that broad forehead, courage in that firm eye and knitted brow, and candour in those full lips, half-parted to reveal two rows of teeth as white as ivory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福那一瞥虽很急促，但对那个他就要审问的人却已有了一个看法。他已从那饱满的前额上认出了聪明，从那黑眼睛和弯弯的眉毛上认出了勇敢，从那半开着的，露出一排珍珠似的牙齿的厚嘴唇上认出了坦白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, in reply, he said aloud: "Monsieur, you may rest entirely assured and you will not have appealed to me in vain if the detainee is innocent; but if, on the contrary, he is guilty… We live in difficult times, Monsieur, when impunity would be the worst of examples: I shall thus be obliged to do my duty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他说，“阁下，你可以放心，我必定公平尽责办理，假如他是冤枉的，那你对我的请求一定不会落空；但假如他的确有罪，那有罪不罚，在目前这个时期，这个例可开得太危险了，我必定要尽我的责任。”【注：①十九世纪初意大利的一个秘密政治组织，因经常装扮成烧炭人集会于树林，故称烧炭党。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，邓蒂斯进来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First impressions had been favourable to Dantès, but Villefort had often heard it said, as a profound political maxim, that one must beware of first impulses, even when they were correct, and he applied this rule on impulses to his impressions, without taking account of the difference between the two terms. He thus stifled the good instinct that was attempting to invade his heart and from there to attack his mind, settled his features in front of the mirror into their grandest expression and sat down, dark and threatening, behind his desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福的第一个印象很不错，但他常常听人警告说，切勿信任第一次的冲动，他把这句格言也用到印象上去，忘记了这两个名词间的差别。所以他抑制住心头的怜悯感，板起面孔，在他的办公桌前坐下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only then that he met Villefort's dull gaze, that look peculiar to men of the law who do not want anyone to read their thoughts, and so make their eyes into unpolished glass. The look reminded him that he was standing before Justice, a figure of grim aspect and manners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这时才第一次接触到维尔福的眼光，——那种法官所特有的眼光，似乎象要看透嫌疑犯脑中的罪恶思想似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who are you and what's your name?"

<div class="line_cn" title="“我是在请人吃喜酒，先生。”青年人说，他的声音微微有点颤抖，刚才那个快乐的时刻和现在这个痛苦的仪式对照起来，其间的差别是太大了。维尔福先生阴沉的脸色和美茜蒂丝满面红光的面孔对照起来，其间的差别也是太大了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This philosophical analogy, he thought, would cause a great stir when he returned to M. de Saint-Méran's salon; and, while Dantès waited for his next question, he was already mentally ordering the antitheses around which orators construct those sentences designed to elicit applause, but which sometimes produce the illusion of true eloquence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这种哲学感想在圣·米兰侯爵家里倒是一个极好的谈话资料。”他想，所以当邓蒂斯在等候他往下问的时候，他正在整理他的思绪，他觉得这是很好的对称话题，而演说家是常常用对称话题来获得雄辩之誉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though usually impassive, nevertheless Villefort was struck by this coincidence; and the emotion in the voice of Dantès, whose happiness had been interrupted, sounded a sympathetic chord with him: he too was to be married, he too was happy, and his own felicity had been disturbed so that he might help to destroy that of a man who, like himself, was on the very brink of happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福虽然仍面不改色，却为这个巧合吃了一惊。邓蒂斯颤抖的声音在他的胸膛里引起了一阵同情的共鸣。邓蒂斯是在他的幸福中被惊扰来的，而他也快要结婚了，他也是在他自己的幸福中被人召来的，但他却来破坏另一个人的幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My political opinions, Monsieur? Alas, I am almost ashamed to admit it, but I have never had what you might call an opinion: I am barely nineteen, as I had the honour to tell you. I know nothing and I am not destined to play any public role. The little that I am and shall be, if I gain the position to which I aspire, I owe to Monsieur Morrel. So all my opinions -- I would not say political, but private opinions -- are confined to three feelings: I love my father, I respect Monsieur Morrel and I adore Mercédès. That, Monsieur, is all I can tell Justice: you see that there is little to interest it there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的政见！我！”邓蒂斯答道。“唉，先生，我从来不曾有过什么政见。我还没有满十九岁，我什么都不知道，我根本插不进去。假如我得到了我所希望的地位，我应该归功于摩莱尔先生。所以，我的全部意见——我不愿说政见，而只是私见——不出这三个范围：我爱我的父亲，我尊敬摩莱尔先生，我喜欢美茜蒂丝。先生，这就是我所能告诉您的一切了。您看，这都是多么无味的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Dantès was speaking, Villefort examined his face, at once so mild and so frank, and recalled the words of Renée who, without knowing the prisoner, had begged indulgence for him. The deputy already had some acquaintance with crime and with criminals; so, in every word that Dantès spoke, he saw proof of his innocence. This young man, one might even say this child, plain, unaffected, eloquent with the heartfelt eloquence that is never found by those who seek it, full of affection for everyone, because he was happy and happiness makes even wicked men good, was so effectively spreading the warmth that overflowed from his heart that the accuser himself was not immune to it. Rough and stern though Villefort had been towards him, Edmond's look, tone and gestures expressed nothing but kindness and goodwill towards his interrogator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯说话时，维尔福凝视着他那伶俐坦白的脸，并想起了丽妮的话，丽妮虽不知道谁是嫌疑犯，却曾代他求过情，请他从宽办理。据代理检察官对于犯罪和犯人的知识看来，这青年所说的每一个字都愈来愈使他相信他的无辜。这个孩子，——因为他还不能说是一个成人，——单纯，自然，有着绝非人力所可强求的，从心底所发出的雄辩，他对每一个人都抱着好感，因为他很幸福，而即使在幸福产生了恶果的时候，他甚至还把他的好感分给他的审判官，虽然维尔福装着一副可畏的目光和严厉的口吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

As I had foreseen, there was some difficulty in gaining an audience with the marshal, but I sent him the ring which was to serve as a token for me, and all doors were opened. He received me, questioned me on the circumstances of poor Leclère's last hours and, as the captain had predicted, gave me a letter which he told me to take, in person, to Paris. I promised to do so, since these were my captain's final wishes. I made land and quickly settled everything that had to be done on board; then I went to see my fiancée, whom I found more lovely and more loving than ever. Thanks to Monsieur Morrel, we were able to circumvent all the formalities of the Church and at last, as I told you, Monsieur, I was celebrating my betrothal. I was to be married in an hour and expected to leave for Paris tomorrow, when I was arrested, on the basis of this denunciation that you seem to despise as much as I do."</div>
