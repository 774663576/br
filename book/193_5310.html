<div class="line_en">Vittoria held the gun out in front of her with both hands. Langdon checked his watch: 8:04P. M. We're crazy to be in here, he thought. It's too dangerous. Still he knew if the killer were inside, the man could leave through any door he wanted, making a one-gun outside stakeout totally fruitless. Catching him inside was the only way… that was, if he was even still here. Langdon felt guilt-ridden over the blunder that had cost everyone their chance at the Pantheon. He was in no position to insist on precaution now; he was the one who had backed them into this corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">The interior of Santa Maria del Popolo was a murky cave in the dimming light. It looked more like a half-finished subway station than a cathedral. The main sanctuary was an obstacle course of torn-up flooring, brick pallets, mounds of dirt, wheelbarrows, and even a rusty backhoe. Mammoth columns rose through the floor, supporting a vaulted roof. In the air, silt drifted lazily in the muted glow of the stained glass. Langdon stood with Vittoria beneath a sprawling Pinturicchio fresco and scanned the gutted shrine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在黯淡的光线下，人民圣母教堂内部成了一个黑暗的洞穴。感觉上不像是主教堂，倒还较像个尚未完工的地铁站。祭坛周围的主圣坛像个障碍赛训练场，拆了一半的地板、堆砖的栈板、土堆、手推车，甚至还有一辆生锈的挖土机。巨大的石柱从地板上昂然升起，支撑著上方的拱形屋顶。在空中，细砂缓缓飘浮在彩绘玻璃筛进来的柔和光芒中。兰登和薇多利雅站在宾杜利基欧于十六世纪初所绘的溼壁画之下，环视著一片狼藉的主圣坛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon gazed through the dusky ghostliness toward the back of the cathedral and studied the outer walls. Contrary to common perception, Renaissance cathedrals invariably containedmultiple chapels, huge cathedrals like Notre Dame having dozens. Chapels were lessrooms than they werehollows -- semicircular niches holding tombs around a church's perimeter wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登的视线穿过黑黝黝的一片朦胧暗影，望向这座主教堂的后方，审视著外侧的墙面。跟一般观念中相反，文艺复兴时期的主教堂通常包含好几个小圣堂，大型主教堂如圣母院则更是有二三十个小圣堂。这些圣堂不太像是房间，而比较像是洞穴──一个个有坟墓的半圆形凹室，环列在教堂各边的墙面上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bad news, Langdon thought, seeing the four recesses on each side wall. There were eight chapels in all. Although eight was not a particularly overwhelming number, all eight openings were covered with huge sheets of clear polyurethane due to the construction, the translucent curtains apparently intended to keep dust off the tombs inside the alcoves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坏消息，兰登心想，看到了两侧墙面上各有四个凹室，总共有八个小圣堂。虽然这个数字不大，但八个凹室的开口都因为整修而罩著巨幅的素面塑胶布，那些半透明布帘显然是要防止灰尘飞进凹室内的坟墓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vittoria pointed at the wall behind him. A decorative tile was embedded in the stone. It was engraved with the same symbol they had seen outside -- a pyramid beneath a shining star. The grime-covered plaque beside it read:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇多利雅指著他后面的墙壁。石墙上嵌著一块有装饰图样的瓷砖。上头刻的符号跟他们在外头看到过的一样──一颗发亮的星星底下有个金字塔。旁边一面灰扑扑的牌子上有说明字样：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A piece of metal clattered to the floor only yards away. The clang echoed through the entire church. Langdon pulled Vittoria behind a pillar as she whipped the gun toward the sound and held it there. Silence. They waited. Again there was sound, this time a rustling. Langdon held his breath. I never should have let us come in here! The sound moved closer, an intermittent scuffling, like a man with a limp. Suddenly around the base of the pillar, an object came into view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有块金属哗啦一声砸在地板上，离他们只有几码，铿锵的回音响彻整个教堂。兰登拉著薇多利雅躲到一根柱子后，同时薇多利雅把枪挥向声音的来源，指著不放。一片静默。他们等待著。接著又有了声音，这回是窸窣声。兰登憋著气不敢呼吸。我们当初就不该进来的！那个声音离他们更近了，是种断续地、轻拖著脚步的声音，像是有人跛足行走。忽然间，柱子底部有个东西进了他们的视线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside the pillar, dragging a half-eaten sandwich in paper, was an enormous rat. The creature paused when it saw them, staring a long moment down the barrel of Vittoria's weapon, and then, apparently unmoved, continued dragging its prize off to the recesses of the church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那根柱子旁，拖著一块包著纸的、吃了一半的三明治的，是一隻大老鼠。那隻老鼠看到他们时停了一下，瞪著薇多利雅的枪管许久，然后又无动于衷地继续拖著牠的奖品，走向教堂的凹室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vittoria lowered the gun, quickly regaining her composure. Langdon peered around the side of the column to see a workman's lunchbox splayed on the floor, apparently knocked off a sawhorse by the resourceful rodent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reluctantly Langdon turned and tried to get his bearings. Cathedral terminology was like stage directions -- totally counterintuitive. He faced the main altar. Stage center. Then he pointed with his thumb backward over his shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed the Chigi Chapel was located in the third of four recessed alcoves to their right. The good news was that Langdon and Vittoria were on the correctside of the church. The bad news was that they were at the wrongend. They would have to traverse the length of the cathedral, passing three other chapels, each of them, like the Chigi Chapel, covered with translucent plastic shrouds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基吉小圣堂似乎位于他们右边四个凹室中数过去第三个。好消息是兰登和薇多利雅位于教堂裡正确的一侧，坏消息是他们位于错误的一端。这下子他们得穿越整个主教堂的长轴，经过三个其他小圣堂，而每个都像基吉小圣堂一样，外头蒙著半透明的塑胶遮布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In her eyes Langdon could see what she was really thinking…I'm the one who lost my father. I'm the one who helped build a weapon of mass destruction. This guy's kneecaps are mine…</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她转身。「可是手裡有枪的人是我。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon sensed the futility and let her go. He moved beside her, cautiously, down the east side of the basilica. As they passed the first shrouded alcove, Langdon felt taut, like a contestant on some surreal game show. I'll take curtain number three, he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感觉到自己坚持下去没有用，就由她去了。他跟在薇多利雅后头，小心翼翼，从长方形大教堂的东端往前走。他们经过第一个罩著遮帘的凹室，兰登觉得很紧张，好像在参加什麽荒诞的游戏节目，我选三号帘幕，他心想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="兰登点点头。他们静悄悄移到开口的一角，躲在一根大柱子的后面。薇多利雅从柱后伸出枪来指著塑胶布，然后她示意兰登拉开帘幕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They passed the second apse, ominous in the slowly darkening cathedral. Night seemed to be falling quickly now, accentuated by the musty tint of the stained-glass windows. As they pressed on, the plastic curtain beside them billowed suddenly, as if caught in a draft. Langdon wondered if someone somewhere had opened a door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们经过了第二个半圆形室，逐渐暗下的主教堂内一片不祥。现在夜色似乎迅速降临了，彩绘玻璃窗的沉重色调使得天色更加昏暗。他们继续前进，身旁那块塑胶帘忽然鼓胀起来，好像是被一股气流吹过。兰登好奇著是不是哪裡有人开了门所造成的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The church was quiet, the thick stone walls blocking out all hints of the outside world. As they hurried past one chapel after the other, pale humanoid forms wavered like ghosts behind the rustling plastic. Carved marble, Langdon told himself, hoping he was right. It was 8:06P. M. Had the killer been punctual and slipped out before Langdon and Vittoria had entered? Or was he still here? Langdon was unsure which scenario he preferred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教堂很安静，厚厚的石墙隔绝了外头世界的一切喧嚣。他们快步经过一个接一个小圣堂，窸窣的塑胶帘后现出类似人形的苍白影子，摇晃有如鬼魅。雕刻的大理石像，兰登告诉自己，希望自己想得没错。现在是八点零六分，那个杀手严格遵守时间、在兰登和薇多利雅进来之前就溜掉了吗？或者他还在这裡？兰登不确定自己比较喜欢哪个情节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vittoria slowed as the third niche loomed before them. She held the gun before her, motioning with her head to the stele beside the apse. Carved in the granite block were two words:</div>

<div class="line_en">A good time to start praying, he thought. Reluctantly, he reached over her shoulder. As carefully as possible, he began to pull the plastic aside. It moved an inch and then crinkled loudly. They both froze. Silence. After a moment, moving in slow motion, Vittoria leaned forward and peered through the narrow slit. Langdon looked over her shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最好开始祈祷了，他心想，不情愿地从她肩后伸手，尽可能小心地开始把塑胶帘拉开。拉开一吋之后，发出了响亮的沙沙声。两人定住，沉默著。过了一会儿，又继续慢慢拉。薇多利雅探出身子，透过那条窄缝凝视裡头，兰登在她肩后也看著。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, neither one of them breathed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好一会儿，两人都不敢呼吸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Overhead, the domed cupola shone with a field of illuminated stars and the seven astronomical planets. Below that the twelve signs of the zodiac -- pagan, earthly symbols rooted in astronomy. The zodiac was also tied directly to Earth, Air, Fire, Water… the quadrants representing power, intellect, ardor, emotion. Earth is for power, Langdon recalled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头上的小圆顶闪耀著一片发亮的群星和七大行星。往下是黄道十二宫──源自天文学的异教、世俗符号。黄道十二宫也直接联繫著土、风、火、水……四个象限各自代表权力、智慧、狂热、感情。土代表权力，兰登记得。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon did not hear. He was in awe, transported for an instant to another world. In his life, he had never imagined a chapel that looked like this. Finished entirely in chestnut marble, the Chigi Chapel was breathtaking. Langdon's trained eye devoured it in gulps. It was asearthly a chapel as Langdon could fathom, almost as if Galileo and the Illuminati had designed it themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon's eyes were transfixed on the pyramids. What are pyramids doing inside a Christian chapel? And incredibly, there was more. Dead center of each pyramid, embedded in their anterior fa? ades, were gold medallions… medallions like few Langdon had ever seen… perfectellipses. The burnished disks glimmered in the setting sun as it sifted through the cupola. Galileo's ellipses? Pyramids? A cupola of stars? The room had more Illuminati significance than any room Langdon could have fabricated in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登两眼牢牢盯著金字塔。一座基督教的小圣堂裡，放金字塔要做什麽？惊人的是，还不止如此而已。每个金字塔的正中央，都按著一个金色纹章……就是兰登之前看到过两三次的那个纹章．．完美的椭圆形。那个磨光的椭圆盘在小圆顶透进来的夕照下发著微光。伽利略的椭圆形？金字塔？画著星星的小圆顶？就算兰登在心中凭空想像，也想不出有这麽多光明会象徵的房间了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Farther down the wall, Langdon saw tributes to the Earth's four temporal seasons -- primavera, estate, autunno, invérno. But far more incredible than any of this were the two huge structures dominating the room. Langdon stared at them in silent wonder. It can't be, he thought. It just can't be! But it was. On either side of the chapel, in perfect symmetry, were two ten-foot-high marble pyramids.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sneering up at them from the floor was the image of a skeleton -- an intricately detailed, marble mosaic depicting "death in flight." The skeleton was carrying a tablet portraying the same pyramid and stars they had seen outside. It was not the image, however, that had turned Langdon's blood cold. It was the fact that the mosaic was mounted on a circular stone-acupermento -- that had been lifted out of the floor like a manhole cover and was now sitting off to one side of a dark opening in the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从地板上朝著他们冷笑的是一个骷髅图──以大理石精细镶嵌的马赛克「溃败的死神」。那具骷髅拿著一块板子，上头描绘著他们在外头看过的金字塔和星星。然而，让兰登全身血液发冷的不是上头的图像，而是那个镶嵌在圆形石板上的图案被从地板上挪起来，就像个下水道的出入孔盖似的，现在放在地板上一个黑暗的洞穴旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vittoria motioned to the far side of the hole where a rotting, wooden ladder descended into the depths.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe there's a flashlight outside in those tools." She sounded eager for an excuse to escape the smell. "I'll look."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「也许外头那些工具裡头会有手电筒。」她的口气好像是急著编个藉口逃离那股臭气。「我去看看。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One strong-willed woman, Langdon thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he turned back to the pit, he felt light-headed from the fumes. Holding his breath, he dropped his head below the rim and peered deep into the darkness. Slowly, as his eyes adjusted, he began to see faint shapes below. The pit appeared to open into a small chamber. Demon's hole. He wondered how many generations of Chigis had been unceremoniously dumped in. Langdon closed his eyes and waited, forcing his pupils to dilate so he could see better in the dark. When he opened his eyes again, a pale muted figure hovered below in the darkness. Langdon shivered but fought the instinct to pull out. Am I seeing things? Is that a body? The figure faded. Langdon closed his eyes again and waited, longer this time, so his eyes would pick up the faintest light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回头来面对著那个洞，臭气薰得他脑袋发昏。他憋著气，头伸进洞裡，凝视著裡头的那片黑暗。缓缓地，等到他的眼睛逐渐适应，他开始看得到下头有模糊的形体。洞裡显然是个小室。恶魔洞，他纳闷有多少代的基吉族人被随意扔进裡面。兰登闭上眼睛等待，迫使自己的瞳孔放大，好能在黑暗中看更清楚。他再度睁开眼睛时，底下的黑暗中有个苍白的模糊人形。兰登颤抖著，第一个本能是离开，但他还是努力撑下去。我看到什麽了吗？那是一具尸体吗？那个人形又逐渐变淡。兰登再度闭上眼睛等待，这回等了更久，好让眼睛能适应最暗的环境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before Langdon could turn, he felt a sharp pain on the back of his neck. He spun to see Vittoria twisting a lit blowtorch away from him, the hissing flame throwing blue light around the chapel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登还没转身，就觉得颈后一阵剧痛。他回头看到薇多利雅正把一个水管工用的喷灯往旁边挪，那道嘶嘶燃烧的火焰照得小圣堂中一片发蓝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was now staring at a crypt bathed in an eerie bluish light. A faint hissing sound reverberated in his ears. Light flickered on the steep walls of the shaft. Suddenly, a long shadow materialized over him. Startled, Langdon scrambled up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前这个地下墓室笼罩在一种诡异的泛蓝光线中。耳边传来一个模糊的嘶嘶声，陡直的洞壁有光线闪烁著。忽然间一个长长的影子罩在他头上。兰登慌忙爬起身来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dizziness started to set in, and his thoughts wandered in the blackness. Just a few more seconds. He wasn't sure if it was breathing the fumes or holding his head at a low inclination, but Langdon was definitely starting to feel squeamish. When he finally opened his eyes again, the image before him was totally inexplicable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开始觉得晕眩，思绪漫游在黑暗中。再等几秒就行了。兰登不确定是因为吸了那股臭气还是因为低头伸进洞裡太久，但他确定自己开始想吐了。最后他终于又睁开眼睛，眼前的景象让他完全无法理解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took the torch and moved slowly toward the hole. Cautiously, he advanced to the rim and pointed the flame down into the hole, lighting the side wall. As he directed the light, his eyes traced the outline of the wall downward. The crypt was circular and about twenty feet across. Thirty feet down, the glow found the floor. The ground was dark and mottled. Earthy. Then Langdon saw the body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他接过喷灯，缓缓走向洞口。他小心翼翼探入洞中，把火焰朝向洞底，照亮了洞壁。他调整著喷灯的方向，双眼循著墙面往下。这个地下墓室是圆的，直径约二十迟。往下约三十迟之处，火焰发出的光照亮了地板。黑暗的地面一片斑驳，是泥土地。然后兰登看到了那具人体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His instinct was to recoil. "He's here," Langdon said, forcing himself not to turn away. The figure was a pallid outline against the earthen floor. "I think he's been stripped naked." Langdon flashed on the nude corpse of Leonardo Vetra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的第一直觉是往回缩。「他在这裡。」兰登说，硬忍著没掉头。泥土地板上的那个人形是个苍白的轮廓。「我想他被脱光衣服了。」兰登脑中闪过李欧纳度．威特拉的赤裸尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
