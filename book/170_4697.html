And so long as Borroq and his boar are about, I dare not let him loose." The skinchanger was to accompany Soren Shieldbreaker to Stonedoor once the wayns carrying the Seal-skinner's clan to Greenguard returned. Until such time, Borroq had taken up residence in one of the ancient tombs beside the castle lichyard. The company of men long dead seemed to suit him better than that of the living, and his boar seemed happy rooting amongst the graves, well away from other animals. "That thing is the size of a bull, with tusks as long as swords. Ghost would go after him if he were loose, and one or both of them would not survive the meeting."</div>

Two hundred? Five hundred? A thousand?" Should I take more men, or fewer? A smaller ranging would reach Hardhome sooner… but what good were swords without food? Mother Mole and her people were already at the point of eating their own dead. To feed them, he would need to bring carts and wagons, and draft animals to haul them -- horses, oxen, dogs.

Back when the Night's Watch had been much larger, its walls had been hung with rows of brightly colored wooden shields.

The shields thus discarded would hang in the Shieldhall.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was large and long enough to seat two hundred, and half again that many if they crowded close. When Jon and Tormund entered, a sound went through the hall, like wasps stirring in a nest. The wildlings outnumbered the crows by five to one, judging by how little black he saw. Fewer than a dozen shields remained, sad grey things with faded paint and long cracks in the wood. But fresh torches burned in the iron sconces along the walls, and Jon had ordered benches and tables brought in. Men with comfortable seats were more inclined to listen, Maester Aemon had once told him; standing men were more inclined to shout.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when a knight died, his shield was taken down, that it might go with him to his pyre or his tomb, and over the years and centuries fewer and fewer knights had taken the black. A day came when it no longer made sense for the knights of Castle Black to dine apart. The Shieldhall was abandoned. In the last hundred years, it had been used only infrequently. As a dining hall, it left much to be desired -- it was dark, dirty, drafty, and hard to heat in winter, its cellars infested with rats, its massive wooden rafters worm-eaten and festooned with cobwebs.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I summoned you to make plans for the relief of Hardhome," Jon Snow began. "Thousands of the free folk are gathered there, trapped and starving, and we have had reports of dead things in the wood." To his left he saw Marsh and Yarwyck. Othell was surrounded by his builders, whilst Bowen had Wick Whittlestick, Left Hand Lew, and Alf of Runnymudd beside him. To his right, Soren Shieldbreaker sat with his arms crossed against his chest. Farther back, Jon saw Gavin the Trader and Harle the Handsome whispering together. Ygon Oldfather sat amongst his wives, Howd Wanderer alone. Borroq leaned against a wall in a dark corner. Mercifully, his boar was nowhere in evidence. "The ships I sent to take off Mother Mole and her people have been wracked by storms. We must send what help we can by land or let them die." Two of Queen Selyse's knights had come as well, Jon saw. Ser Narbert and Ser Benethon stood near the door at the foot of the hall. But the rest of the queen's men were conspicuous in their absence. "I had hoped to lead the ranging myself and bring back as many of the free folk as could survive the journey." A flash of red in the back of the hall caught Jon's eye. Lady Melisandre had arrived. "But now I find I cannot go to Hardhome. The ranging will be led by Tormund Giantsbane, known to you all. I have promised him as many men as he requires."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我召集你们，是为了讨论如何解救艰难屯。”琼恩·雪诺开口，“几千自一由民滞留该地，饥肠辘辘，走投无路，我们还收到报告说森林中有死物。”他看到马尔锡和亚威克在他左边。奥塞尔周围都是工匠，波文身边跟着麻杆维克、左手卢和烂泥地的阿尔夫。破盾者梭伦双手抱胸坐在他右边。再后面一些，琼恩看到商人盖文正和英俊哈雷一交一头接耳，大老爹尤根坐在老婆们当中，流一浪一者豪德独自一人。波罗区靠在墙边的黑暗角落里，谢天谢地，他似乎没带野猪。“我派去接应鼹鼠妈妈一干人的船队在风暴中损失惨重。如今我们必须通过陆路提一供支援，否则他们只能自生自灭。”赛丽丝王后的骑士只来了两名——纳伯特爵士和贝内索恩爵士站在大厅末端的门边——其他后一党一人士显然集体缺席。“我本希望亲自带队，尽可能地挽救自一由民。”黑暗中一抹红色吸引了琼恩。梅丽珊卓女士也来了。“但恐怕我现在分身乏术。这支队伍改由你们熟悉的巨人克星托蒙德领导，我承诺，他需要多少人我就给他多少人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the top of the hall a sagging platform stood. Jon mounted it, with Tormund Giantsbane at his side, and raised his hands for quiet. The wasps only buzzed the louder.

<div class="line_en">Wun Wun did not hear or did not understand. The giant was bleeding himself, with sword cuts on his belly and his arm. He swung the dead knight against the grey stone of the tower, again and again and again, until the man's head was red and pulpy as a summer melon. The knight's cloak flapped in the cold air. Of white wool it had been, bordered in cloth-of-silver and patterned with blue stars. Blood and bone were flying everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旺旺要么没听到，要么没听懂。巨人自己也在流血，肚皮和胳膊上有好几道剑伤。他愤怒地拎起死骑士往塔楼的灰石墙上砸，一次一次又一次，直到男人血淋淋的头烂成夏天的甜瓜。骑士的披风被冷风吹得呼一呼响，能看出是白羊毛织成，镶着银边，饰以蓝色星辰。鲜血和骨头四处飞一溅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Men poured from the surrounding keeps and towers. Northmen, free folk, queen's men…"Form a line," Jon Snow commanded them. "Keep them back. Everyone, but especially the queen's men." The dead man was Ser Patrek of King's Mountain; his head was largely gone, but his heraldry was as distinctive as his face. Jon did not want to risk Ser Malegorn or Ser Brus or any of the queen's other knights trying to avenge him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们从周围的堡垒和塔楼不断涌来。北方人、自一由民、后一党一人士…“排成队，”琼恩命令守夜人，“拦住他们。所有人都拦回去，尤其是后一党一。”死者是国王山的派崔克爵士，他大半个头都没了，但他的纹章跟他的脸一样醒目。琼恩不想刺激梅格罗恩爵士、布鲁斯爵士或王后的其他骑士上去为他复仇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun howled again and gave Ser Patrek's other arm a twist and pull. It tore loose from his shoulder with a spray of bright red blood. Like a child pulling petals off a daisy, thought Jon. "Leathers, talk to him, calm him. The Old Tongue, he understands the Old Tongue. Keep back, the rest of you. Put away your steel, we're scaring him." Couldn't they see the giant had been cut? Jon had to put an end to this or more men would die. They had no idea of Wun Wun's strength. A horn, I need a horn. He saw the glint of steel, turned toward it. "No blades!" he screamed. "Wick, put that knife…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一温一旺·威格·一温一旺·铎迩·一温一旺再次咆哮，他把派崔克爵士另一条胳膊也扯了下来。手臂跟肩膀分家，扯出一片鲜红血雾。就像孩子扯下雏菊的花一瓣，琼恩心想。“皮革，跟他讲道理，让他冷静。古语，他懂古语。其他人都往后退。收起兵器，这会吓到他。”他们没注意到巨人也被砍伤了吗？琼恩必须当机立断，否则会有更多人死。他们不晓得旺旺有多大力气。号角，我需要号角。他瞥见钢铁的寒光，转过头去。“放下武器！”他尖一叫，“维克，把匕首…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"For the Watch." Wick slashed at him again. This time Jon caught his wrist and bent his arm back until he dropped the dagger. The gangling steward backed away, his hands upraised as if to say, Not me, it was not me. Men were screaming. Jon reached for Longclaw, but his fingers had grown stiff and clumsy. Somehow he could not seem to get the sword free of its scabbard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为了守夜人。”维克再次袭来。这回琼恩抓住他手腕，把手臂扭到背后，匕首掉在地上。瘦长的事务官向后退去，抬起双手，似乎在说：不是我，不是我。人们在尖一叫。琼恩摸一向长爪，但手指僵硬笨拙，不知为何，他就是拔不出剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Bowen Marsh stood there before him, tears running down his cheeks. "For the Watch." He punched Jon in the belly. When he pulled his hand away, the dagger stayed where he had buried it.</div>

<div class="line_en">… away, he meant to say. When Wick Whittlestick slashed at his throat, the word turned into a grunt. Jon twisted from the knife, just enough so it barely grazed his skin. He cut me. When he put his hand to the side of his neck, blood welled between his fingers. "Why?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="…放下，他本想说。但麻杆维克的匕首直奔他咽喉而来，他的话卡住了。琼恩及时扭一动脖子，这一刀只擦破皮肤。他想杀我。他用手按住脖子上的伤口，鲜血从指间汩一汩流一出。“为什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon fell to his knees. He found the dagger's hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. "Ghost," he whispered. Pain washed over him. Stick them with the pointy end. When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩双膝跪倒，摸一到匕首一柄一，拔了出来。伤口在夜晚的寒气中冒烟。“白灵，”他轻声呼唤。疼痛席卷而来。用剑的尖端去刺敌人。第三刀刺在肩胛骨，他闷一哼一声，扑倒在皑皑白雪中。">查看中文翻译</div>
