<div class="line_en">Or dead. Buried with his king. "Ah, Robert," he murmured as his groping hand touched a cold stone wall, his leg throbbing with every motion. He remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of Winterfell, as the Kings of Winter looked on with cold stone eyes. The king eats, Robert had said, and the Hand takes the shit. How he had laughed. Yet he had gotten it wrong. The king dies, Ned Stark thought, and the Hand is buried.</div>

<div class="line_en">The straw on the floor stank of urine. There was no window, no bed, not even a slop bucket. He remembered walls of pale red stone festooned with patches of nitre, a grey door of splintered wood, four inches thick and studded with iron. He had seen them, briefly, a quick glimpse as they shoved him inside. Once the door had slammed shut, he had seen no more. The dark was absolute. He had as well been blind.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei Lannister's face seemed to float before him in the darkness. Her hair was full of sunlight, but there was mockery in her smile. "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die," she whispered. Ned had played and lost, and his men had paid the price of his folly with their life's blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦·兰尼斯特的脸庞在黑暗中浮现眼前。她的秀发宛若阳光，微笑中带着嘲弄。“在权力的游戏之中，你不当赢家，就只有死路一条。”她悄声说。奈德输了这场游戏，他的部属以鲜血和生命为他的愚蠢付出了代价。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He damned them all: Littlefinger, Janos Slynt and his gold cloaks, the queen, the Kingslayer, Pycelle and Varys and Ser Barristan, even Lord Renly, Robert's own blood, who had run when he was needed most. Yet in the end he blamed himself. "Fool," he cried to the darkness, "thrice-damned blind fool."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他诅咒他们每个人小指头、杰诺·史林特和他的金袍卫队、王后、弑君者、派席尔、瓦里斯和巴利斯坦爵士，甚至劳勃的亲弟弟蓝礼公爵，因为他在自己最需要他的时候逃之夭夭。然而到了最后，他责怪的是自己。“蠢才！”他对着黑暗大喊，“你这个天杀的蠢才！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he kept very still, his leg did not hurt so much, so he did his best to lie unmoving. For how long he could not say. There was no sun and no moon. He could not see to mark the walls. Ned closed his eyes and opened them; it made no difference. He slept and woke and slept again. He did not know which was more painful, the waking or the sleeping. When he slept, he dreamed: dark disturbing dreams of blood and broken promises. When he woke, there was nothing to do but think, and his waking thoughts were worse than nightmares. The thought of Cat was as painful as a bed of nettles. He wondered where she was, what she was doing. He wondered whether he would ever see her again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如他安静不动，伤腿便不至于痛得太厉害，于是他尽可能地躺着不动。究竟躺了多久，他说不准。这里没有日升月落，什么也看不见，连在墙上做记号都不行。睁眼还是闭眼，一切都无分别。他睡了又醒，醒了又睡，不知睡着和醒来哪一个比较痛苦。睡着的时候会做梦，黑暗的、扰人的梦，充斥着血光以及不能遵守的约定；醒来的时候，除了思考，无事可做，然而他心中所想却比噩梦还可怕。想起凯特，有如躺在荨麻编成的床上那般苦痛。他幻想着此时此刻她置身何处，正在做些什么，却不知此生是否还能与她重逢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hours turned to days, or so it seemed. He could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg, an itch beneath the plaster. When he touched his thigh, the flesh was hot to his fingers. The only sound was his breathing. After a time, he began to talk aloud, just to hear a voice. He made plans to keep himself sane, built castles of hope in the dark. Robert's brothers were out in the world, raising armies at Dragonstone and Storm's End. Alyn and Harwin would return to King's Landing with the rest of his household guard once they had dealt with Ser Gregor. Catelyn would raise the north when the word reached her, and the lords of river and mountain and Vale would join her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间流逝，日子一天天过去，至少感觉起来是这样。石膏下的断腿隐隐作痛，开始发痒。他碰碰大腿，热得发烫。这里惟一的声音，是他的呼吸。时间一久，他开始大声说话，只为了能听见声音。他拟订计划，决心保持神智清醒，在黑暗中筑起希望的城堡。劳勃的两位弟弟安然无恙，此刻正在龙石岛和风息堡整军待发。埃林和哈尔温一旦解决格雷果爵士，便将率领他其余的卫士返回君临。而凯特琳一旦接获消息，便会号召北方诸侯揭竿而起，而三河流域和艾林谷的贵族都会与她并肩作战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He found himself thinking of Robert more and more. He saw the king as he had been in the flower of his youth, tall and handsome, his great antlered helm on his head, his warhammer in hand, sitting his horse like a horned god. He heard his laughter in the dark, saw his eyes, blue and clear as mountain lakes. "Look at us, Ned," Robert said. "Gods, how did we come to this? You here, and me killed by a pig. We won a throne together…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发现自己不断想起劳勃，一次又一次。他看到青春年少的国王，高大英俊，头戴鹿盔，手持战锤，骑在马上宛如长角巨神。黑暗中他听见他的笑声，望着他那对碧蓝澄澈宛如山中湖泊的眼睛。“奈德，你看看我们，”劳勃说，“诸神在上，我们怎会落到这步田地？你被关在这儿，我死在一头猪脚下。当初我们可是一起打下江山，赢得王位…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The king heard him. "You stiff-necked fool," he muttered, "too proud to listen. Can you eat pride, Stark? Will honor shield your children?" Cracks ran down his face, fissures opening in the flesh, and he reached up and ripped the mask away. It was not Robert at all; it was Littlefinger, grinning, mocking him. When he opened his mouth to speak, his lies turned to pale grey moths and took wing.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping. The memory came creeping upon him in the darkness, as vivid as a dream. It was the year of false spring, and he was eighteen again, down from the Eyrie to the tourney at Harrenhal. He could see the deep green of the grass, and smell the pollen on the wind. Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine. He remembered Brandon's laughter, and Robert's berserk valor in the melee, the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right. He remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of the king's pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend King Aerys. Afterward, Ser Oswell Whent helped Jaime to his feet, and the White Bull himself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower, fastened the snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about his shoulders.

<div class="line_en">Ned Stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown, but beneath the pale blue petals the thorns lay hidden. He felt them clawing at his skin, sharp and cruel, saw the slow trickle of blood run down his fingers, and woke, trembling, in the dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奈德·史塔克伸手去抓那项花冠，但浅蓝色的花瓣底下却暗藏着剌。尖利残酷的刺撕扯皮肤，他看着鲜血缓缓流下手指。骤然惊醒，四周一片黑暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion's crown. Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty's laurel in Lyanna's lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当王太子在决胜战中击倒巴利斯坦爵士，绕场一周，准备接下优胜宝冠时，劳勃正与琼恩和老杭特伯爵作最后的拼斗。奈德记得雷加·坦格利安催马跑过自己的妻子——多恩领马泰尔家族的伊莉亚公主，将爱与美的皇后的桂冠放在莱安娜膝上。全场观众笑容消失的那一刻，至今依然历历在目，那是一顶冬雪玫瑰编织而成的皇冠，碧蓝如霜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet when the jousting began, the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen. The crown prince wore the armor he would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when he rode, and it seemed no lance could touch him. Brandon fell to him, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Each time the turnkey brought him water, he told himself another day had passed. At first he would beg the man for some word of his daughters and the world beyond his cell. Grunts and kicks were his only replies. Later, when the stomach cramps began, he begged for food instead. It made no matter; he was not fed. Perhaps the Lannisters meant for him to starve to death. "No," he told himself. If Cersei had wanted him dead, he would have been cut down in the throne room with his men. She wanted him alive. Weak, desperate, yet alive. Catelyn held her brother; she dare not kill him or the Imp's life would be forfeit as well.</div>

"When I was a young boy, before I was cut, I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play, in life as well as mummery. So it is at court. The King's Justice must be fearsome, the master of coin must be frugal, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be valiant… and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple. A courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight." He took the wineskin back and drank.</div>

And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back."</div>

<div class="line_en">"A boy with an army," Varys said. "Yet only a boy, as you say. The king's brothers are the ones giving Cersei sleepless nights… Lord Stannis in particular. His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man. No one knows what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone, but I will wager you that he's gathered more swords than seashells. So here is Cersei's nightmare: while her father and brother spend their power battling Starks and Tullys, Lord Stannis will land, proclaim himself king, and lop off her son's curly blond head… and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe she cares more about the boy."</div>
