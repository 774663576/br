<div class="line_en">When Michael Corleone went into the city that night it was with a depressed spirit. He felt that he was being enmeshed in the Family business against his will and he resented Sonny using him even to answer the phone. He felt uncomfortable being on the inside of the Family councils as if he could be absolutely trusted with such secrets as murder. And now, going to see Kay, he felt guilty about her also. He had never been completely honest with her about his family. He had told her about them but always with little jokes and colorful anecdotes that made them seem more like adventurers in a Technicolor movie than what they really were. And now his father had been shot down in the street and his eldest brother was making plans for murder. That was putting it plainly and simply but that was never how he would tell it to Kay. He had already said his father being shot was more like an "accident" and that all the trouble was over. Hell, it looked like it was just beginning. Sonny and Tom were off-center on this guy Sollozzo, they were still underrating him, even though Sonny was smart enough to see the danger. Michael tried to think what the Turk might have up his sleeve. He was obviously a bold man, a clever man, a man of extraordinary force. You had to figure him to come up with a real surprise. But then Sonny and Tom and Clemenza and Tessio were all agreed that everything was under control and they all had more experience than he did. He was the "civilian" in this war, Michael thought wryly. And they'd have to give him a hell of a lot better medals than he'd gotten in World War II to make him join this one.</div>

<div class="line_en">What Michael wanted was out, out of all this, to lead his own life. But he couldn't cut loose from the family until the crisis was over. He had to help in a civilian capacity. With sudden clarity he realized that he was annoyed with the role assigned to him, that of the privileged noncombatant, the excused conscientious objector. That was why the word "civilian" kept popping into his skull in such an irritating way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔所渴望的就是摆脱，摆脱这一切，安安全全过自己的生活。但是，当前的危机没有过去，他是不忍心同家庭脱离关系的。他起码必须以老百姓的身份从旁帮帮忙。想着想着，他思想上豁然开朗了。他对分配给他的角色感到很烦恼，因为那是有特权的非战斗人员的角色，出于道德上的考虑而本人拒服兵役又获得了免役的人的角色。因此，“老百姓”这个字眼在他的脑壳里一个劲儿地蹦呀跳呀，真使他烦躁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he got to the hotel, Kay was waiting for him in the lobby. (A couple of Clemenza's people had driven him into town and dropped him off on a nearby corner after making sure they were not followed.)</div>

<div class="line_en">Thinking this made him feel guilty about not feeling more sympathy for his father. His own father shot fall of holes and yet in a curious way Michael, better than anyone else, understood when Tom had said it was just business, not personal. That his father had paid for the power he had wielded all his life, the respect he had extorted from all those around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样想着想着，他感到自己有罪，对自己的父亲竟没有更多的同情。他父亲给枪打得浑身是洞眼，说来也奇怪，当汤姆说老头子遭枪击纯粹属于生意上的考虑而不是基于个人恩怨时，他竟比任何人都要理解得深刻。他父亲为一生所挥舞的权力已经付出了代价，为从周围所有的人那里“勒索来的”敬意已经付出了代价。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael said politely, "I don't think so either." He was surprised to find himself so secretive with Kay. He loved her, he trusted her, but he would never tell her anything about his father or the Family. She was an outsider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔很礼貌地说：“我也认为是不真实的。”他发现自己如此守口如瓶而感到吃惊。他爱她，信任她。但是有关他父亲和家族的真实情况，他绝不想吐露半句。她是局外人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔看看手表，说：“探望时间是八点半截止，我想等到大家离开之后去才好。他们会让我进去的。他住的是单人病房，也有专门负责的护士，我可以到他跟前坐一会儿。他也许还不能谈话，甚至也不知道我去探望他，但是，我总得表示我的一点孝心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was getting late and they went up to their room. She mixed a drink for both of them and sat on his lap as they drank. Beneath her dress she was all silk until his hand touched the glowing skin of her thigh. They fell back on the bed together and made love with all their clothes on, their mouths glued together. When they were finished they lay very still, feeling the heat of their bodies burning through their garments. Kay murmured, "Is that what you soldiers call a quickie?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜越来越深了，他俩上楼回到了自己的房间。她调了两杯饮料，就坐在他的大腿上，他俩轮着喝。除去外衣，她全身光生生的，像绸缎，他的手摸到她那热呼呼的大腿。他俩一起滚倒在床上，衣服都没来得及脱就开始了。事完之后他们非常安静地躺在一起，互相感到对方身上的热气透过衣服传到了自己身上。恺埋怨似地说：“这是不是就是你们当兵的所说的“快菜”？”">查看中文翻译</div>

He went to the bathroom to wash up and comb his hair. Kay came in after him and put her arms around his waist from behind. "When are we going to get married?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩都打盹儿了。迈克尔惊醒过来，显得很焦虑，看了一下手表。“糟糕，”他惊叫一声，“都快十点了。我一定得马上到医院去。”说罢，他就到洗澡间洗了个澡，把头发也梳理了一下，恺也跟着进来了，用双臂从后面搂住他的腰。“咱俩打算什么时候结婚呢？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael ran the comb through his hair. "Just say that you've met a brave, handsome guy of Italian descent. Top marks at Dartmouth. Distinguished Service Cross during the war plus the Purple Heart. Honest. Hard-working. But his father is a Mafia chief who has to kill bad people, sometimes bribe high government officials and in his line of work gets shot full of holes himself. But that has nothing to do with his honest hardworking son. Do you think you can remember all that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔用梳子在自己头上梳了一下。“就说你结交了一个祖籍意大利的又勇敢又英俊的小伙子，在达特茅茨念书是最高分。战争中荣获过十字勋章，还有紫心勋章，忠厚、勤奋。但是，他爸爸却是个黑帮头头；他专杀坏人；有时也贿赂政府高级官员；由于他自己职业内部的原因，他遭了枪击，浑身是弹孔。但是这同他忠厚、勤奋的儿子是毫无瓜葛的。这一切你都可以记下来吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔吻了她一下。“我想要你回家去，在你那个安静的小镇上好好想一想。”他说，“我不想马上要你以任何方式卷进这场风波。圣诞节假期过后，我就返校，咱俩就在一起，一道待在山区小镇汉诺威。行吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“行，”她说。她注视着他从屋子里走了出去，望着他在跨进电梯之前向她招手。她对他从来没有像现在这么亲切，像现在这么爱慕，假使有人告诉她三年以内再也见不到他了，那么她会忍受不了这种痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Michael got out of the cab in front of the French Hospital he was surprised to see that the street was completely deserted. When he entered the hospital he was even more surprised to find the lobby empty. Damn it, what the hell were Clemenza and Tessio doing? Sure, they never went to West Point but they knew enough about tactic to have outposts. A couple of their men should have been in the lobby at least.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even the latest visitors had departed, it was almost ten-thirty at night. Michael was tense and alert now. He didn't bother to stop at the information desk, he already knew his father's room number up on the fourth floor. He took the self-service elevator. Oddly enough nobody stopped him until he reached the nurses' station on the fourth floor. But he strode right past her query and on to his father's room. There was no one outside the door. Where the hell were the two detectives who were supposed to be waiting around to guard and question the old man? Where the hell were Tessio and Clemenza's people? Could there be someone inside the room? But the door was open. Michael went in. There was a figure in the bed and by the December moonlight straining through the window Michael could see his father's face. Even now it was impassive, the chest heaved shallowly with his uneven breath. Tubes hung from steel gallows beside the bed and ran into his nose. On the floor was a glass jar receiving the poisons emptied from his stomach by other tubes. Michael stayed there for a few moments to make sure his father was all right, then backed out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使来得最晚的探望病人的人也都离开了。这时差不多是夜间十点半钟。迈克尔感到一阵紧张，立即警惕起来。他没有在问讯处耽误时间；他知道父亲四楼的病房号码。奇怪得很，竟然没有人干涉他。一直走到四楼护士办公室处才有个护士问他。但她问她的，他权当没有听见，只管大踏步走了过去，向他爸爸的病房。病房门外连一个人也没有。说是有两个侦探在附近负责警戒并等着询问老头子，可是人呢？真见鬼，他们上哪儿去了？忒希奥和克莱门扎这两个司令手下的人也不在了。敢情病房里有什么人？但门是开着的，迈克尔进去一看，病床躺着一个人，借着从窗外射进来的月光，迈克尔看到父亲的脸。他父亲的脸毫无表情，胸部随着不均匀的呼吸轻微地忽上忽下。床边的钢架上吊着的软管，通进他的鼻子。另外还有软管把胃里的毒液引出来，滴进地板上放着的玻璃瓶里。迈克尔在那儿呆了几分钟，看准了他父亲没有多大危险之后就退出了病房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The nurse was a pretty young thing with a great deal of confidence in the power of her office. "Oh, your father just had too many visitors, it interfered with the hospital service," she said. "The police came and made them all leave about ten minutes ago. And then just five minutes ago I had to call the detectives to the phone for an emergency alarm from their headquarters, and then they left too.
