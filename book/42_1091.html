<div class="line_en">The shovel felt heavy in Stanley's soft, fleshy hands. He tried to jam it into the earth, but the blade banged against the ground and bounced off without making a dent. The vibrations ran up the shaft of the shovel and into Stanley's wrists, making his bones rattle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Using all his might, he brought the shovel back down onto the dry lake bed. The force stung his hands but made no impression on the earth. He wondered if he had a defective shovel. He glanced at Zero, about fifteen feet away, who scooped out a shovelful of dirt and dumped it on a pile that was already almost a foot tall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利拼尽全身的力气，又将铲子扎向干涸的湖床。反弹力令他的双手疼痛难忍，可地面上还是什么都没留下。斯坦利怀疑自己的这把铲子有问题。他瞥了一眼大约十五英尺之外的零蛋。只见零蛋刚好挖出一铲土，堆在一个差不多一英尺高的土堆上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The shovels were five feet long, from the tip of the steel blade to the end of the wooden shaft.

<div class="line_en">The shovels were kept in a shed near the showers. They all looked the same to Stanley, although X-Ray had his own special shovel, which no one else was allowed to use. X-Ray claimed it was shorter than the others, but if it was, it was only by a fraction of an inch.</div>

If the Warden likes what you found, you'll get the rest of the day off."</div>
