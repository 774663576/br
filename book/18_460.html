<div class="line_en">Coraline walked down the hallway to her father's study. He had his back to her, but she knew, just on seeing him, that his eyes, when he turned around, would be her father's kind grey eyes, and she crept over and kissed him on the back of his balding head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰从过道走进爸爸的书房。他背冲着她，但她一看背影就知道，等他转过身来的时候，脸上一定是爸爸那双和气的灰色眼睛。她蹑手蹑脚溜过去，在爸爸正在谢项的后脑上亲了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，好吧。”他说。他让电脑进入休眠状态，站起来。接着，也没有什么原因，他把卡萝兰抱起来。爸爸已经好久没这么做过了。他告诉过卡萝兰，她已经是个大孩子了，不该老要人抱着走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="好像没过一会儿，上床睡觉的时间就到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dinner that night was pizza, and even though it was home-made by her father (so the crust was alternately thick and doughy and raw, or too thin and burnt), and even though he had put slices of green pepper on it, along with little meatballs and, of all things, pineapple chunks, Coraline ate the entire slice she had been given. Well, she ate everything except for the pineapple chunks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿，他抱着卡萝兰，走进厨房。这天晚上的晚饭是披萨。是爸爸做的。爸爸做的披萨不是太厚、半生不熟，就是薄薄的、烤煳了。这一次，他还在上头洒绿胡椒粉，放上小肉丸子，甚至还放了不少凤梨块儿。可是，卡萝兰还是把切给她的一大片披萨全部吃完了。嗯，基本上全部吃完了，只剩下凤梨块儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline kept the key around her neck, but she put the grey marbles beneath her pillow; and in bed that night, Coraline dreamed a dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was at a picnic, under an old oak tree, in a green meadow. The sun was high in the sky and, while there were distant fluffy white clouds on the horizon, the sky above her head was a deep, untroubled blue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在一棵老橡树下，在一片绿色的草地上野餐。太阳高悬在天空中，远处的地平线上飘着白云，而她头顶上的天空却是一片深蓝，没有一丝烦恼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a white-linen cloth laid on the grass, with bowls piled high with food -- she could see salads and sandwiches, nuts and fruit, jugs of lemonade and water and thick chocolate milk. Coraline sat on one side of the tablecloth while three other children took a side each. They were dressed in the oddest clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="草地上铺着一块白色亚麻布，上面放着好多碗，碗里满满地盛着好吃的。有沙拉和三明治，硬壳果和水果，一壶又一壶柠檬汽水、水、稠稠的巧克力牛奶。卡萝兰坐在餐布一边，其他三边坐着另外三个小孩。他们穿的衣服怪极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The smallest of them, sitting on Coraline's left, was a boy with red-velvet knee-britches and a frilly white shirt. His face was dirty, and he was piling his plate high with boiled new potatoes and with what looked like cold, whole, cooked trout. "This is the finest of picnics, lady," he said to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最小的一个是个男孩，坐在卡萝兰左边。他穿着红色天鹅绒齐膝短裤，一件镶褶边的衬衣。他脸上脏兮兮的，盘子里高高地堆着烤土豆，居然还有一整条冷鲑鱼，是烤出来的。“野餐之美，莫过于此了，女士。”他对她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Coraline. "I think it is. I wonder who organised it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，”卡萝兰说，“说得对。就是不知道是谁安排的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye. This is the finest food I have eaten in centuries," said the girl on Coraline's right. She was a very pale child, dressed in what seemed to be spiders' webs, with a circle of glittering silver set in her blonde hair. Coraline could have sworn that the girl had two wings -- like dusty silver butterfly wings, not bird wings -- coming out of her back. The girl's plate was piled high with pretty flowers. She smiled at Coraline, as if it had been a very long time since she had smiled and she had almost, but not quite, forgotten how. Coraline found herself liking this girl immensely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“此言极是。数百年来，惟这一顿可称至善至美。”卡萝兰右手的女孩说。她长得很白净，穿一件像蛛网一样薄的丝裙，金色头发上扎着一根亮闪闪的银带。卡萝兰百分之百地肯定，这女孩背后长着两只翅膀。淡淡的银色，不是鸟翅膀，很像蝴蝶翅膀。她冲卡萝兰笑着，好像很久很久没有笑过，已经快忘了应该怎么笑。卡萝兰觉得自己一下子喜欢上了这女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, I rather think you did, miss," said a tall girl, sitting opposite Coraline. She wore a brown, rather shapeless dress, and had a brown bonnet on her head which tied beneath her chin. "And we are more grateful for it and for all than ever words can say." She was eating slices of bread and jam, deftly cutting the bread from a large golden-brown loaf with a huge knife, then spooning on the purple jam with a wooden spoon. She had jam all around her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个，今日欢聚，皆应归功于你，女士。”坐在卡萝兰对面的高个子女孩说。她穿着一件褐色裙子，卡萝兰实在说不清样式。头上还戴着一顶兜帽，在下巴底下系好，“感激之情，难以言表。”她在吃果酱面包片。用一把很大的刀子，从烤得黄黄的大面包上灵巧地切下一片，再用木勺舀出一勺紫色果酱。她嘴巴四周沾满了果酱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, in the way of dreams, the picnic had ended and they were playing in the meadow, running and shouting and tossing a glittering ball from one to another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和平时做梦一样，不知怎么的，野餐一下子就完了。大家在草地上玩，跑来跑去，喊着，闹着，扔一个亮晶晶的球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline knew it was a dream then, because none of them ever got tired or winded or out of breath. She wasn't even sweating. They just laughed and ran in a game that was partly tag, partly piggy-in-the-middle, and partly just a magnificent romp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰明白了，这是一个梦，因为没有谁累，也没有谁喘不上气。她连汗都没出。大家笑啊，跑啊。那个游戏有点像官兵抓强盗，又有点像扔手帕，反正就是跑来跑去，玩得高兴极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, without a word about it being spoken, the game was over and the four of them went back to the picnic cloth, where the lunch had been cleared away, and there were four bowls waiting for them, three of ice-cream, one of honeysuckle flowers piled high. They ate with relish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，没说一句话，游戏就这么结束了。大家回到餐布旁。午餐的碗碟已经收走了，只有四个碗等着他们。三碗冰激凌，一碗堆得高高的金银花。他们吃起来，胃口好极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you for coming to my party," said Coraline. "If it is mine."</div>

Gentle, reassuring snores came from her parents' room, but the door was closed. All the doors off the corridor were closed. Whatever the scuttling thing was, it had to be here somewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走出门，瞧了一眼过道另一头挂着的镜子。镜子里只有她自己的脸向外张望，那张脸看上去既瞌睡、又紧张。爸爸妈妈房间里传出让人安心的轻轻的鼾声，他们的门关着。过道里所有门都是关着的。不管那个窸窸窣窣的东西是什么，它一定在别的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

She wondered how long it would be until the sun came up, wondered whether her dream had been a true thing while knowing in her heart that it had been. Something she had taken to be part of the shadows under the hall couch detached itself from beneath the couch and made a mad, scrabbling rush on its long white legs, heading for the front door.</div>
