<div class="line_en">He is 33. He wakes with a jolt, gasping for breath. His thick, black hair is matted with sweat. He blinks hard against the darkness, trying desperately to focus on his arm, his knuckles, anything to know that he is here, in the apartment over the bakery, and not back in the war, in the village, in the fire. That dream. Will it ever stop?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他今天三十三岁。他突然惊醒过来，大口喘着气。他浓密的黑发浸透了汗水。他在黑暗中猛眨着眼睛，拼命地注视自己的胳膊，手背上的关节，或者任何东西。他要知道他就在这里，在面包店楼上的公寓里，而不是在战场上。在那个村子里。在那场大火中。那个梦。它什么时候能停止呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is just before 4 A. M. No point in going back to sleep. He waits until his breathing subsides, then slowly rolls off the bed, trying not to wake his wife. He puts his right leg down first, out of habit, avoiding the inevitable stiffness of his left. Eddie begins every morning the same way. One step and one hobble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快到凌晨四点钟了。没必要再睡回笼觉了。他等着呼吸平息下来。然后，慢慢地翻身下床，尽量不去惊动他的妻子。出于习惯，他把右腿先放到地上，习惯性地企图避免左腿无法避免的僵硬。每天早晨起来都是这样。一脚着地，一脚蹒跚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the bathroom, he checks his bloodshot eyes and splashes water on his face. It is always the same dream: Eddie wandering through the flames in the Philippines on his last night of war. The village huts are engulfed in fire, and there is a constant, high-pitched squealing noise. Something invisible hits Eddie's legs and he swats at it but misses, and then swats again and misses again. The flames grow more intense, roaring like an engine, and then Smitty appears, yelling for Eddie, yelling, "Come on! Come on!" Eddie tries to speak but when he opens his mouth, the high-pitched squeal emerges from his throat. Then something grabs his legs, pulling him under the muddy earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在浴室里，爱迪看了看布满血丝的眼睛，往脸上泼了些水。永远是同样的梦：在菲律宾最后的那个晚上。爱迪茫然地在烈火中穿行。村子里的竹棚已经是一片火海，一个尖锐的叫声不断地传来。一个无形的东西撞到爱迪泛腿，他用手去拍，没有拍到。他又拍了一下，又没拍到。大火愈烧愈烈，像马达一样吼着，然后，史密迪出现了，呼唤着爱迪的名字，大叫着，“快走快走！”爱迪想说话，但是。他嘴巴刚一张开。那个尖锐的叫声从他的喉咙里传了出来。然后。什么东西攫住了他的腿，把他拖进泥泞的土地里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He dresses quietly and goes down the stairs. The taxi is parked by the corner, its usual spot, and Eddie wipes the moisture from its windshield. He never speaks about the darkness to Marguerite. She strokes his hair and says, "What's wrong?" and he says, "Nothing, I'm just beat," and leaves it at that. How can he explain such sadness when she is supposed to make him happy? The truth is he cannot explain it himself. All he knows is that something stepped in front of him, blocking his way, until in time he gave up on things, he gave up studying engineering and he gave up on the idea of traveling. He sat down in his life. And there he remained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪悄悄地穿上衣服，走下楼梯。出租车停在拐角处，那是它通常停的位置，爱迪将汽车挡风玻璃上的水汽抹掉。他从来没跟玛格丽特提起过那种黑暗。她总是抚摸着他的头发，说：“怎么了？”他会说，“没事。就是累了。”然后。不再多言”当她应该使他感到幸福的时候。他如何向她解释这种悲哀？事实上。他自己都解释不请楚。他只知道。有个东西出现在他面前，挡住了他的去路，终于。他开始自暴自弃。他放弃了修工程学为念头，他放弃了出外旅行的念头。他得过且过，就这样混下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then he wakes up. Sweating. Panting. Always the same. The worst part is not the sleeplessness. The worst part is the general darkness the dream leaves over him, a gray film that clouds the day. Even his happy moments feel encased, like holes jabbed in a hard sheet of ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他醒来了。满身大汗。气喘吁吁。永远如此。最糟糕的不是失眠。最糟糕的是那个梦留个他的一片黑暗。那黑暗就像一张灰色的薄膜笼罩住他的日子。那些幸福的时刻也被黑暗包裹得紧紧的，仿佛在一块坚硬的冰上戳出的洞洞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She nodded in satisfaction.

<div class="line_en">"It was Independence Day, the Fourth of July -- a holiday. Emile loved holidays. 'Good for business,' he'd say. If Independence Day went well, the entire summer might go well.

He would go to the raging fire and he would try to salvage his years of work and he would lose himself in anger and fear and when the entrance caught fire, the entrance with my name and my picture, he lost all sense of where he was, too. He was trying to throw buckets of water when a column collapsed upon him."</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie's father used to say he'd spent so many years by the ocean, he breathed seawater. Now, away from that ocean, in the confines of a hospital bed, his body began to wither like a beached fish. Complications developed. Congestion built in his chest. His condition went from fair to stable and from stable to serious. Friends went from saying, "He'll be home in a day," to "He'll be home in a week." In his father's absence, Eddie helped out at the pier, working evenings after his taxi job, greasing the tracks, checking the brake pads, testing the levers, even repairing broken ride parts in the shop.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, one night, at his mother's urging, Eddie visited the hospital. He entered the room slowly. His father, who for years had refused to speak to Eddie, now lacked the strength to even try. He watched his son with heavy-lidded eyes. Eddie, after struggling to find even one sentence to say, did the only thing he could think of to do: He held up his hands and showed his father his grease-stained fingertips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天晚上，在母亲的催促下。爱迪终于来到医院。他慢慢地走进病房。多年来拒绝跟他讲话的父亲，这会儿连试一下的力气都没有了。他用一双沉重的眼睛望着他的儿子。爱迪想了半天，可是连一句话都说不出来，他只好做了一件他能想到的事；他举起他的两只手。让父亲看他的沾满油腻的指甲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Eddie was a teenager, if he ever complained or seemed bored with the pier, his father would snap, "What? This ain't good enough for you?" And later, when he'd suggested Eddie take a job there after high school, Eddie almost laughed, and his father again said, "What? This ain't good enough for you?" And before Eddie went to war, when he'd talked of marrying Marguerite and becoming an engineer, his father said, "What? This ain't good enough for you?" And now, despite all that, here he was, at the pier, doing his father's labor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪十几岁那会儿，一旦他抱怨或者显露出对码头厌烦的情绪，他父亲就会没好气地抢白他一句：“怎么？这对你来说还不够好吗？”后来，当他建议爱迪中学毕业后在码头上找份工作时。爱迪差不多笑出声来，他父亲于是又说：“怎么？这对你来说还不够好吗？”在去打仗之前，爱迪讲到想跟玛格丽特结婚并且成为一个工程师。他的父亲又说：“怎么，这对你来说还不够好吗？”尽管如此，眼下，他还是在这里，在码头上，做他父亲的活计。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, he went to his parents' apartment, entered their bedroom, and opened all the drawers, as if he might find a piece of his father inside. He rifled through coins, a tie pin, a small bottle of apple brandy, rubber bands, electric bills, pens, and a cigarette lighter with a mermaid on the side. Finally, he found a deck of playing cards. He put it in his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，他来到父母的公寓，走进他们的卧室，打开所有的抽屉，好像会在里面找到一些父亲的影字。一些钢镚儿，一个领带夹、一小瓶苹果白兰地、一些橡皮筋、几张电费单、几支钢笔和一个侧面印着美人鱼的打火机。爱迪在这些东西中翻来翻去，终于，他发现了一副扑克牌。他把它揣进了口袋里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define them -- a mother's approval, a father's nod -- are covered by moments of their own accomplishments. It is not until much later, as the skin sags and the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父母们很少会对他们的孩子放手，所以，孩子就对他们的父母放手。他们向前走。他们向远处走。那些曾经让他们感到自身价值的东西—母亲的赞同，父亲的点头—都已经被他们自已取得的成绩所替代。直到很久以后。当他们的皮肤变得松垂了，心脏变得衰弱了。他们才会明白：他们的故事和他们所有的成就，都是基于父母的经历建立起来的，就像生命之河里的石头。层层叠叠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the news came that his father had died --"slipped away," a nurse told him, as if he had gone out for milk -- Eddie felt the emptiest kind of anger, the kind that circles in its cage. Like most workingmen's sons, Eddie had envisioned for his father a heroic death to counter the commonness of his life. There was nothing heroic about a drunken stupor by the beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他父亲的死讯传来—“他走了。”一个护士这样告诉他，就好像他父亲出去拿牛奶了—爱迪感到一种极端空虚的愤怒，一种在笼子里打转的愤怒。像大多数工人的儿子一样，爱迪渴望他父亲会像英雄一样地死去，以抵消他一辈子的平庸。一个瘫倒在海滩上的酒鬼，没有任何光彩可言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The funeral was small and brief. In the weeks that followed, Eddie's mother lived in a daze. She spoke to her husband as if he were still there. She yelled at him to turn down the radio. She cooked enough food for two. She fluffed pillows on both sides of the bed, even though only one side had been slept in.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, Eddie went to the dispatcher and told him he was quitting. Two weeks later, he and Marguerite moved back into the building where Eddie had grown up, Beachwood Avenue -- apartment 6B -- where the hallways were narrow and the kitchen window viewed the carousel and where Eddie had accepted a job that would let him keep an eye on his mother, a position he had been groomed for summer after summer: a maintenance man at Ruby Pier. Eddie never said this -- not to his wife, not to his mother, not to anyone -- but he cursed his father for dying and for trapping him in the very life he'd been trying to escape; a life that, as he heard the old man laughing from the grave, apparently now was good enough for him.</div>
