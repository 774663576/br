He went a mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallowdrip off of his candle and thinking.

Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because he said NOW she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she did; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more.</div>

<div class="line_en">So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more, and she didn't care, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life; she druther die first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我们就在那天夜里，把床单放回晒衣绳子上，另外在衣柜里偷了一条，就这样放放偷偷，有好几天之久。到后来，她也弄不清自己究竟有几条床单，还说反正她也不操这份心了，也不想为了这个白费劲啦。为了多活几天，也不愿再数啦，不然的话，她宁愿死了拉倒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would blow over by and by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，我们如今就太平无事啦。衬衫啊，床单啊，调羹啊，还有蜡烛啊什么的，靠了牛犊子、耗子和点数目的一笔胡涂账，就这样全都混过去了。至于蜡烛台，那无关紧要，慢慢也会混过去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of course we thought of the right way at last – which was to cook the ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过馅饼的事倒是个难题。为了馅饼，我们可受累无穷。我们在下边老远的树林子里做好了，随后在那里烘焙，最后终算做成了，并且叫人非常满意。不过，并非一日之功就能做成的。我们用了满满三面盆面粉才做成的，并且烤得我们伤痕累累，眼睛几乎给浓烟熏瞎。因为，你知道，我们要用的只是那张酥皮，可是这酥皮总是撑不起来，老是往下陷。不过，后来我们终于找到了解决的办法，那就是把绳梯放在馅饼里一块儿烘。于是在第二天晚上，我们到了杰姆的屋里，把床单全撕成一小条一小条，搓在一起，远在天亮前就搞出了一根美美的绳索，用来绞死一个人也行。我们“只当是”花了九个月时间才做成了的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan – afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过我们并不需要这些。我们所需要的，就光只是放在馅饼里的，所以我们把多余的都扔掉了。我们并没有在洗衣盆里烘饼，深怕盆的焊锡见火会化。西拉斯姨父有一把珍贵的铜暖炉，是他珍爱之物，因为这有木头长把子的炉，是他的一个祖先随着征服者威廉坐“五月花”之类早先的船只从英格兰带来的，他一直把它和其它珍贵的古物藏在顶楼上。珍藏的原因倒不是因为有什么价值，它们并无什么价值，但却是因为这些是古董。我们把它偷偷弄了出来，带到下边的树林子里。烘开头几次馅饼时失败了，因为我们开头不得法，不过最后还是成功了。我们先把炉底和炉边铺了一层生面团，把炉子放在煤火上，再放上一团布索子在里面，上面加一层面团，把它罩住，盖上炉盖子，上面放一层滚烫的煤炭。我们站在五英尺之外，握着长长的木把子，既凉快，又舒服。十五分钟以后，馅饼就成了，看起来也叫人挺舒服。不过嘛，吃这个馅饼的人得带好几桶牙签才行，因为要不是馅饼会把他的牙缝塞得结结实实，那就是说我是在胡说八道了。再说，一吃以后，准会叫他肚子疼得止不住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在上午，我们把这个带到了下边的树林子里，不过馅饼包不住这绳索。既然是用整整一张床单做的，绳索就够四十个馅饼用的，如果我们真要做那么多的话。此外还有大量剩余的，可以用来做汤、做香肠或者别的你爱吃的东西都成。总之足够一顿筵席用的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
