<div class="line_en">We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was a little late on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in any child -- his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我到那里的时候有点迟了，马车把他放在一个小旅馆门前，他就站在那里充满渴望地张望着找我，我立刻感到曾见过他，他身上由内至外散发着蓬勃朝气，还有第一次见他小妹妹时一样纯洁的积极气息。他俊俏得令人难以置信，格罗斯太太曾说过，他的外表掩盖了所有的品质，只留下一种令人顿生怜爱之心的气质。当时，深深打动我内心的是，在他身上没有一种气息，就是只知道爱而不谙世事的特点，这确实不可思议，我从未在其他任何一个和他同龄的孩子身上发现这种神圣的品质。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lessons with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own. I learned something -- at first, certainly -- that had not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow.

<div class="line_en">Oh, it was a trap -- not designed, but deep -- to my imagination, to my delicacy, perhaps to my vanity; to whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble -- they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate -- but even this with a dim disconnectedness -- as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哦，这是一个陷阱——不是预先设计好的，却又很深——是对我的想象、我的细致，也许是我的虚荣的一个陷阱，不管是什么，我的内心都非常激动。用一句话最准确地描述这种情景，那就是我放松了警戒。他们很少给我惹麻烦——他们是如此乖巧。我常推想他们将来会遇到怎样的困难和挫折的历练（因为所有人的未来都是艰难的）——尽管这些跟目前没有什么关联。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed and protected, the only form that, in my fancy, the afteryears could take for them was that of a romantic, a really royal extension of the garden and the park.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded -- or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees -- I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost with a sense of property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure -- if he ever thought of it! -- To the person to whose pressure I had responded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始的几周白天比较长，他们经常慷慨地给予我所谓的自由支配的时间，就是我的学生喝茶、就寝的时间，在真正的休息之前，那短暂的间隔就是我的时间。就像我喜欢我的学生们一样，这段时间是一天中我最喜欢的。而且我还最喜欢在天色渐暗，或者夕阳西下、最后几只鸟鸣啼归巢的时候，在红彤彤的天空下，绕过一片老树，来到野外散步，用一种为我独有的快乐和满足，享受这里的美丽与高贵。毫无疑问，在这样的时刻，能够感受自己内心的宁静和平和，真是一种乐趣；抑或回想着，通过我的细心、理智和大方得体的行为，我也许正向和我承受同样压力的人传播快乐——如果他也这么想的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What I was doing was what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I COULD, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected.

<div class="line_en">That was exactly present to me -- by which I mean the face was -- when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot -- and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for -- was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did stand there! -- But high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它真的出现了，我的意思是，在最初的那几天里，这张脸真的出现在我面前了，六月漫长的一天傍晚，我从种植园里出来，观赏房子的时候，那张脸就出现了，我突然停下了脚步。我呆立在原地，比看到任何景象都更为吃惊，我的幻想竟在一瞬间变成了现实。他的确站在那里！但他却站在草坪的另一端，那幢高高的塔顶处，第一天早上，小弗洛拉曾带我去过那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone would appear there at the turn of a path and would stand before me and smile and approve. I didn't ask more than that -- I only asked that he should KNOW; and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那人会出现在小路的拐弯处，站在我面前，冲着我颔首微笑。我不会多问他任何问题，我只问他该知道的，而且唯一可以确信他知道的方法，就是看他俊俏的脸庞上那种亲切的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This tower was one of a pair -- square, incongruous, crenelated structures -- that were distinguished, for some reason, though I could see little difference, as the new and the old. They flanked opposite ends of the house and were probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a respectable past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这幢塔楼是双塔中的一个——方形、不对称的雉堞状的结构，它们是不同的，尽管我几乎看不出两幢塔楼间有什么差别，但是一新一旧还是能区分开来。它们座落在房子的两侧，几乎是建筑中的荒谬之物，不过两塔却并没有完全分离，高度也合乎常理，就还说得过去。从浪漫主义复兴时期算起，也已有其光辉的历史了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I admired them, had fancies about them, for we could all profit in a degree, especially when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我崇拜它们，对它们充满种种幻想，因为某种程度上，我们从中都会有所感悟，尤其在黄昏时分，若隐若现中，可以看出塔楼城垛的庄严。然而我想象中经常出现的那个人不应该出现在如此高的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得当时，在清晰的暮色中，他给了我两种完全不同的情感的冲击，很明显，第一种是震惊，第二种是惊奇。后一种是我猛然意识到前一种感觉的错误：进入我视线的那个人并不是我原本设想的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in the house -- and for how long, above all? -- A person of whom I was in ignorance.</div>

<div class="line_en">It lasted while this visitant, at all events -- and there was a touch of the strange freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat -- seemed to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect, as it struck me, and with both hands on the ledge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个陌生人还是站在那里，但我当时有一种奇特的自由感觉，我清楚地记得，他没有戴帽子，穿着随便，从他所呆的地方，穿过从他身上产生的幽暗的光线，他似乎带着疑虑和思忖注视着我，这似乎治愈了我。我们隔得太远而不能彼此说话，但有一刻，稍近一点，我们之间相互较量、相互注视的眼神打破了这种沉默。使我惊奇的是，他在离房子较远的一个角度上，站得非常笔直，双手放在突起的垛口上。">查看中文翻译</div>

Yes, I had the sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to the next.
