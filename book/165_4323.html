<div class="line_en">His sense of time was very accurate: The tremor came the moment he expected it, a powerful, violent quake that seemed to originate from deep within the earth. The vibrating silver candelabra hummed, and a wisp of dust that had sat on top of the Great Palace for perhaps a thousand years fell down and drifted into the candle flames, where the motes exploded in tiny sparks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every three hours -- the time it took the Ottomans to reload one of the monstrous bombards designed by the engineer Orban -- twelve-hundred-pound stone balls battered the walls of Constantinople. These were the world's strongest walls: first built by Theodosius II during the fifth century, they had been continually reinforced and expanded, and were the main reason that the Byzantine court had survived so many powerful enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次间隔三小时，这是奥斯曼帝国的乌尔班巨炮装填一次所需的时间。巨弹击中的是世界上最坚固的城墙，由狄奥多西二世建于公元5世纪，之后不断扩展加固，它是拜占庭人在强敌面前的主要依靠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the giant stone balls now gouged openings into the walls with each strike, like the bite of an invisible giant. The emperor could imagine the scene: While the debris from the explosion filled the air, countless soldiers and citizens rushed onto the fresh wound in the walls like a swarm of brave ants under a sky full of dust. They filled in the break with whatever was at hand: bits and pieces taken from other buildings in the city, flaxen-cloth bags of earth, expensive Arabic carpets… He could even imagine the cloud of dust, steeped in the light of the setting sun, drifting slowly toward Constantinople like a golden shroud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但现在，巨弹每次都能把城墙击开一个大缺口，像被一个无形的巨人啃了一口。皇帝能想象出那幕场景：空中的碎石块还没落下，士兵和市民就向缺口一拥而上，像漫天尘土中一群英勇的蚂蚁。他们用各种东西填堵缺口，有从城内建筑上拆下的砖瓦木块，有装满沙土的亚麻布袋，还有昂贵的阿拉伯挂毯……他甚至能想象出浸透了夕阳金辉的漫天飞尘如何缓慢地飘向城内，像一块轻轻盖向君士坦丁堡的金色裹尸布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the five weeks the city had been under siege, these tremors had come seven times a day, spaced as regularly as the strokes of some colossal clock.

Compared to these tremors, the ringing of the double-headed eagle copper clock in the corner that represented the time of Christendom seemed feeble.</div>

<div class="line_en">The emperor looked at her. The noblewomen of Constantinople tended to favor clothes bedecked with elaborate decorative elements, while the commoners wore plain, shapeless white garments that draped to the ankles. But this Helena seemed a combination of both. Instead of a tunic embroidered with gold thread, she wore a commoner's white dress, but over it she draped a luxurious cloak; however, instead of the purple and red reserved for the nobility, the cloak was dyed yellow. Her face was enchanting and sensual, bringing to mind a flower that would rather rot in adoration than fade in solitude.</div>

<div class="line_en">More than nine centuries earlier, during the reign of Justinian the Great, master craftsmen had cast two chalices out of pure gold, studded with gems and glowing with a beauty that seized the soul. The two chalices were identical save for the arrangement and shapes of the gems. One of the two was kept by successive Byzantine emperors, and the other one had been sealed along with other treasures into a secret chamber in the foundation of Hagia Sophia in 537 C. E., when the great church was rebuilt.</div>

Although many knew of the secret chamber under the great church, few knew its exact location.

It should have been impossible to enter the chamber without a massive engineering effort.</div>

<div class="line_en">Four days ago, however, the emperor had ordered the precious artifacts of the city collected in case of Constantinople's fall.

<div class="line_en">But Phrantzes gazed at the spy in cold fury. No matter how many witnesses testified to the contrary, he must certainly be lying: The complete minaret was ironclad proof. However, Phrantzes had no time to mete out punishment; now that the city was about to fall, no one would escape the punishment of the Conqueror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大臣冷冷地看了一眼跟踪者，不管有多少人证明，跟踪者肯定还是撒谎了，因为完整的尖塔是超越一切的铁证。但法扎兰现在没有心思去惩罚谁，城市的末日即将来临，他们所有人都难逃惩罚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A soldier off to the side knew that the missing top of the minaret hadn't been destroyed by a cannonball. He had found the top half of the minaret missing one morning two weeks ago. There had been no cannon fire the previous night, and he had recalled that there was no debris on the ground around the minaret. The two soldiers who had been with him that morning had both died in battle. However, seeing the look on Phrantzes's face, he decided to keep quiet about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，旁边一名士兵也有话隐瞒。他知道，这塔曾经消失的上半部分并非是被炮火摧毁的，两个星期前的一个夜晚，并没任何炮击，早晨塔尖就不见了，当时他还注意到塔周围的地面上没有一点儿碎砖石。这里的城墙是乌尔班巨炮重点轰击的地段，那巨大的石弹随时都会穿透城墙落到这里，有一次一下子就杀死了十几名士兵，那半截塔随时会被摧毁，所以再也没人到塔里去过。与他一同见证这事的其他两人都已阵亡，他不想再横生枝节，因为说出来也没人会信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Phrantzes and his men entered the bottom of the minaret. Even the spy who Phrantzes was sure had lied came along. They saw remnants of the corpses of plague victims that had been scattered around the ruin by feral dogs, but there were no signs of anyone living.</div>

<div class="line_en">They ascended the stairs. In the flickering torchlight on the second story, they saw Helena curled under a window. She appeared to be asleep, but her half-closed eyes reflected the light from the torches. Her clothes were torn and dirty and her hair unkempt; a few bloody scratch marks crossed her face, perhaps self-inflicted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们接着沿着贴墙建的旋梯上到了二层，在火炬的光亮中，一眼就看到了蜷在窗下的狄奥伦娜，她显然睡着了，但双眸仍在半闭的眼皮间映射着火光。她的衣服破了，上面满是尘土，头发蓬乱，脸上有两三道很像是自己抓出的血痕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Phrantzes looked around. This was the top of the minaret, an empty, cone-shaped space. He noted the thick layer of dust covering everything, but there were few marks in the dust, as though Helena, like them, had arrived only recently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大臣打量了一下四周，这是塔的最上一层，呈一个锥形空间，空无一物。他注意到，这里到处积满厚厚的灰尘，一碰就会留下明显的痕迹，但周围的痕迹很少，似乎狄奥伦娜也同他们一样是第一次到这里来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She awoke, and, scrabbling at the walls with her hands, stood up. Moonlight falling through the window turned the messy hair around her face into a silvery halo. She stared, wide-eyed, and seemed to return to the present only with effort. But she then closed her eyes again, as though trying to linger inside a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很快被惊醒了，两手乱抓着靠墙站起来，窗口透人的一束月光把她的一头乱发映成一团围绕着头部的银雾；她圆睁双眼，好半天才使意识回到现实，然后又突然半闭双眼陷入回忆状，似乎还在留恋刚刚走出的梦境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With her eyes still half closed, as if to savor her memory like a child holding on to a favorite toy that she would not give up, she answered, "There's so much space there. So comfortable…" She opened her eyes and looked around in terror. "But here, it's like the inside of a coffin, whether I'm inside the minaret or outside. I have to go there!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狄奥伦娜仍半闭着双眼，执着地陶醉于自己的回忆，像一个孩子挣扎热不让大人把她从心爱的玩具旁拉开。“那里很大，很好，很舒服。这里……”她突然睁开双眼惊恐地环顾着周围。“这里像棺材一样，外面……也像棺材一样窄。我想去那里！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Waves of noise cascaded over them. If one listened carefully, two sources could be distinguished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阵阵声浪从外面传来，仔细听，这声浪分成截然不同的两部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One source was from outside the city. Mehmed II had decided to launch the final assault on Constantinople tomorrow. At this moment, the young sultan was riding through the Ottoman camps, promising his soldiers that all he wanted was Constantinople itself -- the treasure and women of Constantinople would belong to his army, and after the fall of the city, the soldiers would have three days to loot everything they desired. All the soldiers cheered at the sultan's promise, and the sound of trumpets and drums added to their glee. This joyous din, mixed with the smoke and sparks rising from fires in front of the camps, covered Constantinople like an oppressive tide of death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一部分声浪来自城外。穆罕默德二世已经决定明天对君士坦丁堡发起总攻，这时，年轻的苏丹正策马走过奥斯曼军的所有营帐，他向将士们许诺：我只要君士坦丁堡本身，城市中的财富和女人都是你们的，破城后可以在城中自由洗劫三天。全军为苏丹的许诺而欢呼，此起彼伏的欢呼声中还夹杂着军号和手鼓声这声浪随着无数堆营火的烟雾和火星升上天空，变成一片浓重的杀气聚集在城市上空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The noise coming from inside Constantinople, on the other hand, was lugubrious and subdued. All the citizens had paraded through the city and gathered at Hagia Sophia to attend a final Mass. This was a scene that had never occurred and would never occur again in the history of Christianity: Accompanied by solemn hymns, under the light of dim candles, the Byzantine emperor, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Orthodox Christians of the East and Catholics from Italy, soldiers in full armor, merchants and sailors from Venice and Genoa, and multitudes of ordinary citizens all gathered in front of God to prepare for the final battle of their lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来自君士坦丁堡城内的声音则沉浑悲婉。全体市民在大主教的带领下举行了宗教游行。现在，所有人都会聚到圣索菲亚大教堂，参加最后一次安魂弥撒。这是基督教历史上从未有过，也不会再有的场景：在庄严的圣歌声中，在昏暗的烛光下，拜占庭皇帝和大主教、东正教徒、来自意大利的天主教徒、全副武装的城市守军、威尼斯和热那亚的商人以及水手，还有无数的市民，他们一起聚集在上帝面前，准备用生命迎接最后的血战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Phrantzes knew that his plan had failed. Perhaps Helena was nothing but a skilled fraud, and she possessed no magic at all -- he preferred that possibility by far. But there was another, more dangerous alternative: She did possess magic, and she had already gone to Mehmed II, who had given her a new mission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法扎兰知道这件事不能再继续下去了，也许狄奥伦娜只是一个高明的骗子，她根本没有魔法，这是比较好的结果。但同时他还面临着一个巨大的危险：她真有魔法，而且已经到过敌方，领受奥斯丝人的使命后又回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After all, what could the Byzantine Empire, teetering on the brink of ruin, offer her? The emperor's promise to make her into a saint was unlikely to be fulfilled: Neither Constantinople nor Rome was likely to declare a witch and a whore a saint. Indeed, she had likely returned with two new targets in mind: Constantine, and himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毕竟奄奄一息的拜占庭给不了她什么，甚至那个圣女的荣誉都很难兑现——东正教和天主教教会都很难接受让一个妓女和女巫成为圣女。她这次返回的目标，可能是皇帝甚到也自己。乌尔班已是前车之鉴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hadn't Orban, the Hungarian engineer, already been an example of this? He had come to Constantine first with plans for his giant cannons, but the emperor had no money to pay his salary, let alone finance the construction of such monstrous engines. He had then gone to Mehmed II, and the daily bombardments had served as a constant reminder of his betrayal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乌尔班，旬牙利工程师，曾到君士坦丁坚建造巨地，但财政空应的拜占庭当局连他徽薄的工资都无法支付，他便投奔穆罕默德二世，为奥斯里建选了一种巨型大炮。长逾八米直径七十五厘米，可发射半吨重的炮弹到一英里远的地方，史称乌尔班大炮。在对君士坦丁竖的攻城战中发挥了巨大的威力，是唯一能摧毁该城市竖因城堵的武器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Phrantzes looked over at the spy, who immediately unsheathed his sword and stabbed at Helena's chest. The sword pierced her body and got stuck in a crack in the wall behind her. The spy tried to pull the sword out, but it wouldn't budge. Helena rested her hands on the sword's hilt. The spy let go of the weapon, unwilling to touch her hands. Phrantzes left with his men.</div>

<div class="line_en">Throughout her execution, Helena never made any noise. Gradually, her head drooped, and the silvery halo formed by her tresses fell away from the beam of moonlight and faded into darkness. The moon's glow lit a small patch of ground in the dark interior of the minaret, where a stream of blood flowed like a slender, black snake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个过程中狄奥伦娜没有发出任何声音，她的头慢慢垂了下来。那团银雾离开月光没人黑暗。塔内完全黑了下来，在那束惨白月光照在地上的一小块光亮处，血像一条细细的黑蛇蜿蜒爬过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the bloody slaughter of the day was coming to its inevitable end, Constantine, faced with the swarming Ottoman masses, shouted, "The city is fallen and I am still alive." Then he tore off his imperial robe and unsheathed his sword to meet the oncoming hordes. His silvery armor glinted for a moment like a piece of metallic foil tossed into a tub of dark red sulfuric acid, and then vanished.</div>

<div class="line_en">The historical significance of the fall of Constantinople would not be apparent for many years. For most, the obvious association was that it marked the final gasp of the Roman Empire. Byzantium was a thousand-year rut behind the wheels of Ancient Rome, and though it enjoyed splendor for a time, it finally evaporated like a water stain under the bright sun. Once, ancient Romans had whistled in their grand, magnificent baths, thinking that their empire, like the granite that made up the walls of the pools in which they floated, would last forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="君士坦丁堡陷落的历史意义许久之后才显现出来，事情发生时人们首先想到的，就是罗马帝国终于完全消失了。拜占庭是古罗马拖在身后的长达千年的车辙，虽也有过辉煌，但还是终于像烈日下的水渍一样蒸发了。当年，古罗马人在宏伟华丽的浴宫中吹着口哨，认为帝国就像身下的浴池一样，建在整块花岗岩上，将永世延续。">查看中文翻译</div>
