<div class="line_en">In the loveliest town of all, where the houses were white and high and the elm trees were green and higher than the houses, where the front yards were wide and pleasant and the back yards were bushy and worth finding out about, where the streets sloped down to the stream and the stream flowed quietly under the bridge, where the lawns ended in orchards and the orchards ended in fields and the fields ended in pastures and the pastures climbed the hill and disappeared over the top toward the wonderful wide sky, in this loveliest of all towns Stuart stopped to get a drink of sarsaparilla.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parking his car in front of the general store, he stepped out and the sun felt so good that he sat down on the porch for a few moments to enjoy the feeling of being in a new place on a fine day. This was the most peaceful and beautiful spot he had found in all his travels. It seemed to him a place he would gladly spend the rest of his life in, if it weren't that he might get homesick for the sights of New York and for his family, Mr. and Mrs. Frederick C. Little and George, and if it weren't for the fact that something deep inside him made him want to find Margalo.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. Harriet's quite a girl. Her people, the Ameses, are rather prominent in this town. One of her ancestors used to be the ferryman here in Revolutionary days. He would carry anybody across the stream -- he didn't care whether they were British soldiers or American soldiers, as long as they paid their fare. I guess he did pretty well. Anyway, the Ameses have always had plenty of money. They live in a big house with a lot of servants. I know Harriet would be very much interested to meet you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。哈丽雅特是很美的女孩子。她们埃姆斯家在这个镇子里相当的出名。她的一个祖先在大革命时代曾经做过船夫。他把每个人都带到小河对岸去——不管他们是英国士兵还是美国士兵，只要他们肯付船钱就行。我猜他的买卖一定很不错。不管怎样，总之埃姆斯家总是非常有钱。他们现在住在一个有许多佣人的大房子里。我知道，哈丽雅特见到你一定非常高兴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's very kind of you," replied Stuart, "but I'm not much of a society man these days. Too much on the move. I never stay long anywhere -- I blow into a town and blow right out again, here today, gone tomorrow, a will o' the wisp. The highways and byways are where you'll find me, always looking for Margalo. Sometimes I feel that I'm quite near to her and that she's just around the turn of the road. Other times I feel that I'll never find her and never hear her voice again. Which reminds me, it's time I was on my way." Stuart paid for his drink, said good-by to the storekeeper, and drove off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常感谢，”斯图亚特回答，“但是这些天我没时间去交朋友了。我只有不停地到处走。我从不在一个地方呆很久——我像一阵风一样在无数的镇子里进出，今天到这里，明天去那里，行踪总是飘忽不定。不管是在大路还是小道，你都能看到在时刻寻找玛戈的我。有时我感觉已经离她很近了，她似乎就在路的转弯处。其它的时候我觉得我永远也找不到她也听不到她的声音了。这使我意识到，我又到了该继续上路的时候了。”斯图亚特付了汽水钱，和店主说声再见便离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Ames' Crossing seemed like the finest town he had ever known, and before he reached the end of the main street he swerved sharp left, turned off onto a dirt road, and drove down to a quiet spot on the bank of the river. That afternoon he swam and lay on his back on the mossy bank, his hands crossed under his head, his thoughts returning to the conversation he had had with the storekeeper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是因为埃姆斯镇实在是他到过的最美的小镇，所以他在开到离开这里的主干道前还是忍不住把车来了个左转弯，转向一条泥土路，开到河边的一处宁静的地方。那个下午，他游了一个泳，然后就躺在铺满青苔的岸边手枕着头休息了，这时他又回忆起那个店主的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the morning the sun rose warm and bright and Stuart slipped into the river again for an early dip. After breakfast he left his car hidden under a skunk cabbage leaf and walked up to the post office. While he was filling his fountain pen from the public inkwell he happened to glance toward the door and what he saw startled him so that he almost lost his balance and fell into the ink. A girl about two inches high had entered and was crossing the floor toward the mail boxes. She wore sports clothes and walked with her head held high. In her hair was a stamen from a flower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨的太阳变得温暖而又明亮时，斯图亚特又跳到水里游泳了。早饭后，他把车藏到一片甘蓝叶的下面，然后往邮局那里走。他在那里的公用墨水槽里给他的钢笔灌墨水时，偶然间朝门口瞥了一眼。他所看到的使他大吃一惊，以至于身体突然失去了平衡，差点儿栽倒在墨水槽里。有一个大约两英寸高的小女孩正从地板那里往信箱这边走。她穿着运动服，走路时头昂得高高的。她的头发里插着一根花芯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Evening came, and Stuart still lingered by the stream. He ate a light supper of a cheese sandwich and a drink of water, and slept that night in the warm grass with the sound of the stream in his ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Must be the Ames girl," he said to himself. And he kept out of sight behind the inkwell as he watched her open her mail box, which was about a quarter of an inch wide, and pull out her letters. The storekeeper had told the truth: Harriet was pretty. And of course she was the only girl Stuart had ever encountered who wasn't miles and miles taller than he was. Stuart figured that if the two of them were to walk along together, her head would come a little higher than his shoulder. The idea filled him with interest. He wanted to slide down to the floor and speak to her, but he didn't dare. All his boldness had left him and he stayed hidden behind the inkwell until Harriet had gone. When he was sure that she was out of sight, he stole out of the post office and slunk down the street to the store, half hoping that he would meet the beautiful little girl, half fearing that he would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那一定就是埃姆斯家的那个女孩，”他自语。他躲在墨水槽的后面偷看她打开她那四分之一英寸高的邮箱，往外取信。店主告诉他的话是真的：哈丽雅特真美。而且她也是斯图亚特遇到过的唯一不比自己高很多倍的女孩子。斯图亚特能算出来，如果他们在一起走，她的头将和他的肩膀那里差不多高。这个想法顿时让他来了兴致。他想跳到地板上和她说话，可是又不敢。所有的勇气陡然间都弃他而去，他只好躲在那里直到她离开。当他确信她真的走远了，才偷偷地溜出邮局，来到街边的一家商店，心里既盼望在这里再见那个美丽的小女孩，又怕真的会再见到她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The storekeeper helped Stuart up onto the counter and found some letter paper for him -- small paper, marked with the initial "L." Stuart whipped out his fountain pen and sat down against a five-cent candy bar and began a letter to Harriet:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="店主把他放到柜台上，给他找了几张信纸——那些纸很小，每张纸的上角还印着一个字母“L”。斯图亚特拉下钢笔帽，倚坐在一块价值五美分的硬糖上，开始给哈丽雅特写信：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pray forgive me, Miss Ames," continued Stuart, "for presuming to strike up an acquaintance on so slender an excuse as our physical similarity; but of course the fact is, as you yourself must know, there are very few people who are only two inches in height. I say 'two inches'-- actually I am somewhat taller than that. My only drawback is that I look something like a mouse. I am nicely proportioned, however. Am also muscular beyond my years. Let me be perfectly blunt: my purpose in writing this brief note is to suggest that we meet. I realize that your parents may object to the suddenness and directness of my proposal, as well as to my somewhat mouselike appearance, so I think probably it might be a good idea if you just didn't mention the matter to them. What they don't know won't hurt them. However, you probably understand more about dealing with your father and mother than I do, so I won't attempt to instruct you but will leave everything to your good judgment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请原谅我的鲁莽，埃姆斯小姐，”斯图亚特继续写，“但是当看到你那与我相似的外表时我感到就如同遇到了一个旧友。就是这样，因为你知道，很少有人身高只有两英寸。我说‘两英寸’还不太确切——实际上我比那还高一点儿。我唯一的缺陷是我的样子像一只老鼠。但即便如此，我还是一个很不错的人。我还有着一身与我的年龄不相称的强壮肌肉。我干脆坦白说吧：我写这个便条的目的是想约你出来见一面。我怕你的父母可能会反对我这个直率而又突然的提议，而且由于我的外表像老鼠一样，所以我想如果你不对他们谈起这件事，结果会更好。这样他们就会一无所知，也不会受到伤害了。可是，你也许更愿意和你的父母讨论这件事，如果那样的话我也不会强迫你别这么做，但我还是要把我的意见留给你做参考。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The storekeeper carried the canoe and the paddles out in front of the store and set them down in the street. He wondered what this tiny boatman would do next, but Stuart never hesitated.
