<div class="line_en">Within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff–loads of men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody–minded outcast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞口的锁被打开，暗淡的光线下显现出一幅惨兮兮的景象。印第安·乔躺在地上，四肢伸直死了。他的脸离门缝很近，看上去好像在那最后一刻，企盼的眼神死盯着外面的光明和那自由自在的欢乐世界。汤姆受到了震动，因为他亲身在洞中呆过，所以能理解这个家伙当时的苦楚。他动了恻隐之心，但不管怎么说他觉得现在十分地快慰和安全，这一点他以前从没有体会到。自打他做证，证明那个流浪汉的罪行之后，他心头一直有种沉重的恐惧感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Injun Joe's bowie–knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great foundation–beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something-in order to pass the weary time-in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water–drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock–tick-a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was "news." It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need? and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half–breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow–dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="印第安·乔的那把猎刀还在他身边，刀刃已裂成两半。他死前拼命用刀砍过那门下面的大横木，凿穿了个缺口，可是这没有用，外面的石头天然地形成了一个门框，用刀砍这样坚固的门框，简直是鸡蛋碰石头，根本不起作用，相反刀倒被砍得不成形了。就算没有石头，印第安·乔也是白费气力，他可以砍断大横木，但要想从门下面钻出来也是不可能的，他自己也明白这一点。他砍大横木，只是为了找点事干，为了打发那烦人的时光，以便有所寄托。往常，人们可以找到五六截游客们插在缝隙间的蜡烛头，可是这一次一截也没有，因为这个被困的家伙把所有的蜡烛头都找出来吃掉了。他还设法捉到几只蝙蝠，除了爪子外全吃掉了。这个可怜而又不幸的家伙最后是饿死的。不远处有个石笋，已有些年月，它是由头顶上的钟乳石滴水所形成的。他把石笋弄断后，把一块石头放在石笋墩上，凿出一个浅窝来接每隔三分钟才滴下来一滴宝贵的水。水滴声像钟表一般有规律，令人烦闷，一天一夜下来才能接满一汤匙。自金字塔刚出现，这水就在滴；特洛伊城陷落时；罗马城刚建立时；基督被钉上十字架时；征服者威廉大帝创建英国时；航海家哥伦布出航时；莱克星屯大屠杀鲜为人知时；那水就一直在滴个不停。现在它还在滴，即使等一切随着历史成为烟消云散，而后被人遗忘，它还会滴淌下去。世间万物是不是都有目的，负有使命呢？这滴水五千年来默默地流淌不断，是不是专为这个可怜虫准备的呢？它是不是还有另外重要的目的，再流它个一万年呢？这没什么要紧的。在那个倒霉的混血儿用石头窝接那宝贵的水之前，已过去了若干年。可是如今的游客来麦克道格拉斯山洞观光时，会长时驻足，盯着那块令人伤心的石头和缓缓而下的水滴，印第安·乔的“杯子”在山洞奇观中格外突出，连“阿拉丁宫殿”也比不上它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing-the petition to the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon–petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water–works.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事过后人们不再向州长提赦免印第安·乔的事了。许多人都在请愿书上签了名，还开过许多声一把泪一把的会议，选了一群软心肠的妇女组成请愿团，身穿丧服到州长那里哭诉，请求他大发仁慈之心，别管自己的职责要求。据说印第安·乔手里有五条人命案，可那又怎么样呢？就算他是魔鬼撒旦，也还会有一帮糊涂蛋愿在请愿书上划押，并且从他们那永远没修好的“自来水龙头”里滴出泪水来洒在请愿书上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now.

<div class="line_en">"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well–gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there was no money–box. The lads searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆先下，边往下走，边打一些粗糙的脚蹬儿。哈克跟在后面，有大岩石的那个石洞分出四个叉道口。孩子查看了三个道口，结果一无所获，在最靠近大石头的道口里，他们找到了一个小窝，里边有个铺着毯子的地铺，还有个旧吊篮，一块熏肉皮，两三块啃得干干净净的鸡骨头，可就是没钱箱。两个小家伙一遍又一遍地到处找，可还是没找到钱箱，于是汤姆说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him --</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle–grease on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's that for? I bet you the money IS under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，哈克，这块石头的一面泥土上有脚印和蜡烛油，另一面却什么也没有。你想想，这是为什么呢？我跟你打赌钱就在石头下面，我要把它挖出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By–and–by Tom said:</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，哈克，听到木头的声音了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他说是在十字下，你瞧，这不就是最靠近十字底下的地方吗？不可能藏在石头底下面吧，这下面一点缝隙也没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆立刻掏出正宗的巴罗刀，没挖到四英寸深就碰到了木头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by–and–by, and exclaimed:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈克也开始挖，不一会工夫，他们把露出的木板移走，这时出现了一个通往岩石下的天然裂口。汤姆举着蜡烛钻了进去。汤姆说他看不到裂口尽头处，想进去看看，于是弯着腰穿过裂口。路越来越窄，渐渐地往下通去。他先是右，然后是左，曲曲弯弯地沿着通道往前走，哈克跟在汤姆后面。后来汤姆进了一段弧形通道，不久就大声叫道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我也不知道，不过强盗们总是聚会痛饮，我们当然也要这样做。快走，哈克，我们在这里呆的时间太长了，现在不早了，我也饿了，等到船上就可以吃东西，抽香烟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久他俩出来后钻进了绿树林，警惕地观察四周，发现岸边没人，就开始上船吃起饭，抽起烟来。太阳快接近地平线时，他们撑起船离岸而去，黄昏中汤姆沿岸边划了很长时间，边划边兴高采烈地和哈克聊天，天刚黑他俩就上了岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe.

<div class="line_en">The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and candle–grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:</div>
