<div class="line_en">The rest is a little flattish and faded. Slowly I drove downhill, and presently found myself going at the same lazy pace in a direction opposite to Parkington. I had left my raincoat in the boudoir and Chum in the bathroom. No, it was not a house I would have liked to live in. I wondered idly if some surgeon of genius might not alter his own career, and perhaps the whole destiny of mankind, by reviving quilted Quilty, Clare Obscure. Not that I cared; on the whole I wished to forget the whole mess -- and when I did learn he was dead, the only satisfaction it gave me, was the relief of knowing I need not mentally accompany for months a painful and disgusting convalescence interrupted by all kinds of unmentionable operations and relapses, and perhaps an actual visit from him, with trouble on my part to rationalize him as not being a ghost. Thomas had something. It is strange that the tactile sense, which is so infinitely less precious to men than sight, becomes at critical moments our main, if not only, handle to reality. I was all covered with Quilty -- with the feel of that tumble before the bleeding.</div>

<div class="line_en">The road now stretched across open country, and it occurred to me -- not by way of protest, not as a symbol, or anything like that, but merely as a novel experience -- that since I had disregarded all laws of humanity, I might as well disregard the rules of traffic. So I crossed to the left side of the highway and checked the feeling, and the feeling was good. It was a pleasant diaphragmal melting, with elements of diffused tactility, all this enhanced by the thought that nothing could be nearer to the elimination of basic physical laws than deliberately driving on the wrong side of the road. In a way, it was a very spiritual itch. Gently, dreamily, not exceeding twenty miles an hour, I drove on that queer mirror side. Traffic was light. Cars that now and then passed me on the side I had abandoned to them, honked at me brutally. Cars coming towards me wobbled, swerved, and cried out in fear. Presently I found myself approaching populated places. Passing through a red light was like a sip of forbidden Burgundy when I was a child. Meanwhile complications were arising. I was being followed and escorted. Then in front of me I saw two cars placing themselves in such a manner as to completely block my way. With a graceful movement I turned off the road, and after two or three big bounces, rode up a grassy slope, among surprised cows, and there I came to a gentle rocking stop. A kind of thoughtful Hegelian synthesis linking up two dead women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路正向一片开阔地延伸，我忽然想到——不是为了标新立异，不是作为一种象征，或任何相似的原因，而只是作为一种新奇的体验——既然我已无视了人性的法律，我同样也可以无视交通规则。于是我横开到高速公路的左边，看看感觉如何，还真不错。是一种令人很舒适的消融感，其中有扩散了的触觉因素，又因想到没有什么能比存心在公路左边行驶更近于消除自然的基本法则，这感觉愈益增强了。从某方面看，这是一种精神的渴望。我靠公路奇异如镜的左边前行，稳稳地，象在梦中，每小时车速不超过二十英里。交通并不拥挤，不时有车从我弃给它们的那一边驶过去，开车人很粗鲁地冲我鸣喇叭。迎面而来的车，先是犹豫不决，后又突然转向，最后惊怒地大叫。不久，我发现就要进入居民区了。闯一次红灯就象我小时候偷着咂一口大人不准喝的葡萄酒。这时，混乱的局面终于出现。于是，我受到了跟踪，又受到了护送。接着在我前面，我看见两辆车正摆出阵势，要把我的路彻底堵死。我优雅地转了个弯，驶离了公路，通通地颠了两、三下后，驶上了一个草坡，驶进了惊慌失措的奶牛群里，我就轻轻摇晃着在那儿停下。一种令人费解的黑格尔学派综合论，联系着两个已死的妇人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was soon to be taken out of the car (Hi, Melmoth, thanks a lot, old fellow)-- and was, indeed, looking forward to surrender myself to many hands, without doing anything to cooperate, while they moved and carried me, relaxed, comfortable, surrendering myself lazily, like a patient, and deriving an eerie enjoyment from my limpness and the absolutely reliable support given me by the police and the ambulance people. And while I was waiting for them to run up to me on the high slope, I evoked a last mirage of wonder and hopelessness. One day, soon after her disappearance, an attack of abominable nausea forced me to pull up on the ghost of an old mountain road that now accompanied, now traversed a brand new highway, with its population of asters bathing in the detached warmth of a pale-blue afternoon in late summer. After coughing myself inside out, I rested a while on a boulder, and then, thinking the sweet air might do me good, walked a little way toward a low stone parapet on the precipice side of the highway. Small grasshoppers spurted out of the withered roadside weeds. A very light cloud was opening its arms and moving toward a slightly more substantial one belonging to another, more sluggish, heavenlogged system. As I approached the friendly abyss, I grew aware of a melodious unity of sounds rising like vapor from a small mining town that lay at my feet, in a fold of the valley. One could make out the geometry of the streets between blocks of red and gray roofs, and green puffs of trees, and a serpentine stream, and the rich, ore-like glitter of the city dump, and beyond the town, roads crisscrossing the crazy quilt of dark and pale fields, and behind it all, great timbered mountains. But even brighter than those quietly rejoicing colors -- for there are colors and shades that seem to enjoy themselves in good company -- both brighter and dreamier to the ear than they were to the eye, was that vapory vibration of accumulated sounds that never ceased for a moment, as it rose to the lip of granite where I stood wiping my foul mouth. And soon I realized that all these sounds were of one nature, that no other sounds but these came from the streets of the transparent town, with the women at home and the men away. Reader! What I heard was but the melody of children at play, nothing but that, and so limpid was the air that within this vapor of blended voices, majestic and minute, remote and magically near, frank and divinely enigmatic -- one could hear now and then, as if released, an almost articulate spurt of vivid laughter, or the crack of a bat, or the clatter of a toy wagon, but it was all really too far for the eye to distinguish any movement in the lightly etched streets. I stood listening to that musical vibration from my lofty slope, to those flashes of separate cries with a kind of demure murmur for background, and then I knew that the hopelessly poignant thing was not Lolita's absence from my side, but the absence of her voice from that concord.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，我就被逮下车。（嗨，梅尔莫斯，万分感谢，老朋友）——而且，的确，我盼望对着无数只手臂投降，他们移动我，搬我出去时，我一点点合作也不付出，就那么悠然地、舒舒服服地、懒懒地把自己缴出了。我象个病人，从我的虚弱无力和警察与救护人员给我的绝对可靠的援助中，我得到一种怪异的乐趣。当我停在那高高的斜坡上等待他们向我跑来时，我终于唤起了最后一个奇怪、让人绝望的幻景。某一天，她刚刚失踪后不久，我正在一条旧山道上赶路，一阵难以忍受的恶心突然袭来，我只得停在了一片阴影中。那条山道一会儿与一条崭新的公路并行，一会儿又横越过去，向另一个方向独伸；在夏末一个淡蓝色的午后，成群的紫苑花沐浴在远离尘间的温暖里。我猛烈地咳了一阵，心象是要咳出来，然后坐在一块大石头上休息了片刻。想着温和的空气可能会对我好些，于是，就朝公路不远处靠近悬崖那一边的一段低低的石头护墙走过去。小蚱蜢从路边干枯的野草中跳跃出来。一片轻轻的浮云正舒展开了臂膀，向另一块略显厚重的云片靠过去，这另一块是连接着一个更板滞、如天网般凝重的云系。悬崖下山谷里包裹着一个小小的矿镇。当我渐渐走近那座友好的悬崖，愈发感觉到各种声音美妙而飘渺的组合，如蒸汽一般，从我脚下，从山坳里的那座小矿镇升腾而上。绿烟袅袅的红灰房顶间呈各种几何图形的街道，树林，一条蜿蜒的小溪，闪着铁矿石般绚丽光彩的垃圾堆；小镇那边，条条小路纵横交错在黑色与白色的田野里；再远处，是密林覆盖的群山。然而比所有这一切无声而生动的色彩更明快的是——这些色彩、这些光影融洽在一起，仿佛正自享其乐——听起来，而不是看上去，都更明快，更如幻梦一般的，是那积聚的音响，象升腾的气在震颠，永不停顿，一直升入花岗岩石的唇边，我正站在那儿，揩净我嘴上的恶臭气。接着，我就发现所有这一切音响都只有一个渊源，它们，只是它们从那透明的小镇街上来，那里的女人们正守在家中，男人们正在外奔忙。读者！我所听到的不过是正在玩耍的孩子们的欢闹，不过如此；而空气是这般明澈，在这混杂的音响雾气里，宏亮的和微弱的。遥远的和神奇般眼前的，坦率的和神圣般莫测高深的——人们可以不时地听到，一声清脆而活泼的笑声，球棒敲击的啪啪声，或一辆玩具四轮马车的哐啷哐啷声，这一切都仿佛从那片迷蒙中透露出来。但是，它们太远了，根本无法分辨清他们正在那摸模糊棚的街道里玩著什么样的游戏。我站在这高高的斜坡顶上，倾听那微微的音乐般的震颤，倾听那轻轻的嗡嗡声中间或迸出的欢叫声，然后我明白了，那刺痛心肺、令人绝望的东西并不是洛丽塔不在我的身边，而是她的声音不在那和声里了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I started, fifty-six days ago, to write Lolita, first in the psychopathic ward for observation, and then in this well-heated, albeit tombal, seclusion, I thought I would use these notes in toto at my trial, to save not my head, of course, but my soul. In mid-composition, however, I realized that I could not parade living Lolita. I still may use parts of this memoir in hermetic sessions, but publication is to be deferred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五十六天前，我开始写《洛丽塔》时，先是在精神病房里等候诊断，后来是在这暖融融的、封闭的隔离室里，我想我要在审判时用上所有这些笔记，当然，不是为救我的性命，而是为挽救我的灵魂。然而，写到一半的时候，我觉得我不能把活着的洛丽塔暴露出来。在与外界隔绝的开庭审理过程中，我也许还会用到这部回忆录中的一些部分，但出版的日期必须推迟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This then is my story. I have reread it. It has bits of marrow sticking to it, and blood, and beautiful bright-green flies. At this or that twist of it I feel my slippery self eluding me, gliding into deeper and darker waters than I care to probe. I have camouflaged what I could so as not to hurt people. And I have toyed with many pseudonyms for myself before I hit on a particularly apt one. There are in my notes "Otto Otto' and "Mesmer Mesmer" and "Lambert Lambert," but for some reason I think my choice expresses the nastiness best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是我的故事。我已经重读过一遍。里面有点点的精髓，有血，有美丽的绿苍蝇。在故事里的这一曲或那一折里，我觉得我难以捉摸的自我总是在躲避我，滑进了深沉沉、黑暗沉沉的汪洋里，我是探不到的。我已把我能隐瞒的东西都隐瞒了，以免伤害人们。我随意为自己设想了许多笔名，直到后来我忽然得了非常恰当的一个。我的记录中有“奥托．奥托”，“梅斯梅。梅斯梅”，和“兰姆伯特。兰姆伯特”，但不知何故，我觉得我最后的选择最确切地表达了我的龌龊和肮，脏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For reasons that may appear more obvious than they really are, I am opposed to capital punishment; this attitude will be, I trust, shared by the sentencing judge. Had I come before myself, I would have given Humbert at least thirty-five years for rape, and dismissed the rest of the charges. But even so, Dolly Schiller will probably survive me by many years. The following decision I make with all the legal impact and support of a signed testament: I wish this memoir to be published only when Lolita is no longer alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为一些看起来比其本身更明显的原因，我反对死刑；我相信，这种态度会和判决的法官是一致的，如果我自己来审判我自己，我就会以强奸罪判处亨伯特至少三十五年徒刑，而对其余指控不予受理。但即使这样，我死了多年以后，多丽。希勒很可能仍然活着。于是在一份签过字的合法遗嘱的影响和鼓励下，我作出了如下的决定：只有等洛丽塔不再活在世上时，这本回忆录才能出版。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, neither of us is alive when the reader opens this book. But while the blood still throbs through my writing hand, you are still as much part of blessed matter as I am, and I can still talk to you from here to Alaska. Be true to your Dick. Do not let other fellows touch you. Do not talk to strangers. I hope you will love your baby. I hope it will be a boy. That husband of yours, I hope, will always treat you well, because otherwise my specter shall come at him, like black smoke, like a demented giant, and pull him apart nerve by nerve. And do not pity C. Q. One had to choose between him and H. H., and one wanted H. H. to exist at least a couple of months longer, so as to have him make you live in the minds of later generations. I am thinking of aurochs and angels, the secret of durable pigments, prophetic sonnets, the refuge of art. And this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，当读者们打开这本书的时候，我们俩都已不在人世了。但既然血液仍在我写字的手掌里奔流，你仍象我一样受着上帝的保佑，我便仍然可以从这儿向阿拉斯加的你说说话。忠实于你的狄克。不要让别的男人碰你。不要与陌生人搭讪。我希望你会爱你的孩子。我希望他是个男孩儿。你的那个丈夫，我希望，会永远待你好，否则，我的鬼魂，象黑烟，象一个发狂的巨人的鬼魂将把他一条一条撕碎。不要可怜克。奎。上帝必须在他与亨。亨之间选择一个，上帝让亨．亨至少多活了几个月，好让他使你能活在未来几代人的心里。我正在想欧洲野牛和天使，在想持久的颜料的秘密，预言家的十四行诗，艺术的避难所。而这是你与我能共享的唯一的永恒，我的洛丽塔。">查看中文翻译</div>
