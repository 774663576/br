<div class="line_en">Park was the only person she knew who wore his backpack actually on his shoulders, not slung over one side -- and he was always holding onto the straps, like he'd just jumped out of a plane or something. It was extremely cute. Especially when he was being shy and letting his head hang forward.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="对埃莉诺保密似乎不对。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Park didn't know if Eleanor even had any girl's clothes -- and he didn't care. He kind of liked that she didn't. Maybe that was another gay thing about him, but he didn't think so, because Eleanor wouldn't look like a guy even if you cut off her hair and gave her a mustache. All the men's clothes she wore just called attention to how much of a girl she was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克不知道埃莉诺有没有女孩的衣服，也不在乎，甚至希望她没有。或许这是一种同性恋特质，但应该不是，因为就算你剪掉埃莉诺的头发，给她画上胡子，她也不像男人。她穿的那些男人衣服只是让人更注意她有多么女性化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Plus, if he told her, at the very least she was going to want to go home and change. She was wearing an orange argyle sweater today, way too big, with her silky green tie and baggy painter's jeans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，如果跟埃莉诺说了，她肯定会想先回家换衣服。她穿的橘色菱形图案毛衣非常肥大，搭配绿色丝质领带，和宽松的画家裤版型牛仔裤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She told herself that Park's family must be decent people because they'd raised a person like Park. Never mind that this principle didn't hold true in her own family. It wasn't like she had to face his family alone. Park would be there. That was the whole point. Was there any place so horrible that she wouldn't go there to be with Park?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她告诉自己，他们是正派人家，否则养不出帕克这样的孩子。虽然这个原则完全不适用于她们家。何况，她也不必单独面对帕克的家人，帕克会在她身边。重点就在这里。世上会有她不愿与帕克同行的恐怖地方吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
