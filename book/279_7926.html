<div class="line_en">Tom presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom, breakfast–room, dining–room, and library, combined. The balmy summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her knitting -- for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a hail–storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden-a lovely little blue–eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long–tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes. The fresh–crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走过杰夫·撒切尔家住的房子的时候，看见有一个新来的女孩子站在花园里——一个漂亮可爱的蓝眼睛的小姑娘。金黄色的头发梳成两只长长的发辫，身上穿着白色的夏季上装和宽松的长裤。这位刚戴上胜利花冠的战斗英雄一枪没打就束手投降了。一个叫艾美·劳伦斯的姑娘立刻从他的心目中消失了而且不留一点痕迹，他原以为他爱她爱得发狂，而且他把自己这种爱当作深情的爱慕，不过旁人看来那不过是一种可怜渺小、变幻无常的爱恋罢了。为了获取她的欢心，他费了好几个月的工夫，可她答应他还不到一个星期。他只是在短短的七天内当了一次世界上最幸福、最自豪的男孩子。可现在片刻之间，她就像一位拜访完毕，告辞离去的稀客一般，从他心里离去了，消失了，被他忘得一干二净。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt's cow–stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the village, where two "military" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person-that being better suited to the still smaller fry-but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides–de–camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and hard–fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆绕过那一排房子，来到靠着他姨妈牛圈后面的一条泥泞巷子里。他很快就完全地溜到抓不到也罚不着他的地方，匆忙赶到村里那块公共场地。在那里，两支由孩子们组成的“军队”按事先的约定已集合起来，准备打仗。汤姆是其中一支部队的将军，他的知心好友乔·哈帕则是另一支队伍的统帅，这两位总指挥不屑于亲自战斗——那更适合手下的军官战士去打——而他们却在一个凸出的高地方坐在一块，让他们的随从副官去发号施令，指挥打仗。经过一番长时间的艰苦奋战，汤姆的部队取得了辉煌的胜利。接着就是双方清点死亡人数，交换战俘，谈妥下次交战条件，还约定好作战日期。一切结束之后，双方部队先列好队形，然后开拔，而汤姆也就独自回家了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute-only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart-or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆跑过去停在离花一两英尺的地方，然后用手罩在眼睛上方朝街上看去，仿佛发现那边正发生了什么有趣的事情。随后他拎起一根草杆放在鼻子上，头尽量往后仰着，极力保持着那草杆的平衡。于是，他吃力地左右移动着身体，慢慢地侧身朝那朵三色紫罗兰挪过去。最后，他的光脚落在花上，用灵巧的脚趾头抓住了它，于是，他拿着他心爱的东西，在转弯处消失得无影无踪了。他很快就把那花别在他上衣里面贴近他心脏的地方——也许是贴近他的胃部，因为他不太懂解剖学，好在他也无所谓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to "show off" in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by–and–by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity, reached for the sugar–bowl-a sort of glorying over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model "catch it." He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said to himself, "Now it's coming!" And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out:</div>

<div class="line_en">Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign-a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age–long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她就受到了良心的谴责，非常想讲几句爱抚体贴的话，可是她断定这么一来，就会被认为她是在认错，这可是规矩所不容的。于是，她一声不吭，忙这忙那，可心乱如麻。汤姆坐在角落处生着气，心里越想越难受，他知道在姨妈心里，她正向他求得谅解，也就因为有这种感觉，虽然闷闷不乐但仍感到满足。他不肯挂出求和的信号，对别的表示也不去理睬。他知道有两道渴望的目光透过泪帘不时地落在他身上，可是他偏不肯表示他已经看出来。他想象着自己躺在那儿病了，快要不行了，他姨妈俯身弯腰看着他，恳求他讲一两句饶恕她的话，可是他转过脸去冲着墙，没说原谅她就死去了。啊，那时她会觉得怎么样呢？他又想象着自己淹死了，被人从河里救起抬回家来，头上的小卷发都湿透了，他那伤透了的心得到了安息。她会多么伤心地扑到他身上，眼泪雨点般地落下来，嘴里不住地祈求上帝把她的孩子还给她，保证将永远、永远不再虐待他了！但是，他却躺在那里浑身冰凉，脸色惨白，毫无动静——一个可怜的人，一个受苦受难的人，终于结束了一切烦恼。他越想就越伤心。后来，为了嗓子不哽塞住，只好把泪水往肚子里咽。他的眼睛被泪水蒙住了，只要眼睛一眨，泪水就会淌出来，顺着鼻尖往下掉。他从这种悲伤中获得了无限的安慰和快意，所以这时如果有什么庸俗的愉快或者什么无聊的欢乐来搅乱他的心境的话，他是绝不能忍受的。因为他这种快慰非常圣洁，不该遭到玷污。所以，一会儿之后当他的表姐玛丽手舞足蹈地跑进来的时候，他马上就避开了她。她到乡下去作客，只住了一星期，仿佛时隔三秋似的，她现在又看到自己的家，真是高兴极了。但是，当她唱着歌欢快地从一扇门走进来的时候，汤姆却站起身来乘着阴云暗影从另一扇门溜出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower. He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world? This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.</div>

<div class="line_en">About half–past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second–story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And thus he would die-out in the cold world, with no shelter over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death–damps from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And thus SHE would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut down?</div>
