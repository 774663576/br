<div class="line_en">At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，他们沿着迷宫似的蜿蜒曲折的甬道向前疾驰，哈利想记住走过的路，左拐，右拐，右拐，左拐，中间的岔路口，再右拐，左拐，根本记不住咔哒咔哒响的小推车似乎认识路，根本不用拉环去驾车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late -- they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冰冷空气呼啸而过，把哈利的眼睛都吹痛了，但是他还是竭力睁大眼睛。一次，他似乎看到甬道尽头有一团火，便转过身去，想看看那里是不是有一条龙。但是，已经来不及了，他们已经冲到地底下更深的地方，经过一片地下湖，上边挂满了巨大的钟乳石和石笋，一直垂到地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.
