<div class="line_en">The house was left; the house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sandhill to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it. The long night seemed to have set in; the trifling airs, nibbling, the clammy breaths, fumbling, seemed to have triumphed. The saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed. Toads had nosed their way in. Idly, aimlessly, the swaying shawl swung to and fro. A thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder. The swallows nested in the drawing- roon; the floor was strewn with straw; the plaster fell in shovelfuls; rafters were laid bare; rats carried off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots. Tortoise-shell butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on the window-pane. Poppies sowed themselves among the dahlias; the lawn waved with long grass; giant artichokes towered among roses; a fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages; while the gentle tapping of a weed at the window had become, on winters' nights, a drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which made the whole room green in summer.</div>

<div class="line_en">What power could now prevent the fertility, the insensibility of nature? Mrs McNab's dream of a lady, of a child, of a plate of milk soup? It had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished. She had locked the door; she had gone. It was beyond the strength of one woman, she said. They never sent. They never wrote. There were things up there rotting in the drawers -- it was a shame to leave them so, she said. The place was gone to rack and ruin. Only the Lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter, looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow, the rat and the straw. Nothing now withstood them; nothing said no to them. Let the wind blow; let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage. Let the swallow build in the drawing-room, and the thistle thrust aside the tiles, and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz of the arm-chairs. Let the broken glass and the china lie out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild berries.</div>

<div class="line_en">If the feather had fallen, if it had tipped the scale downwards, the whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the sands of oblivion. But there was a force working; something not highly conscious; something that leered, something that lurched; something not inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual or solemn chanting. Mrs McNab groaned; Mrs Bast creaked. They were old; they were stiff; their legs ached. They came with their brooms and pails at last; they got to work. All of a sudden, would Mrs McNab see that the house was ready, one of the young ladies wrote: would she get this done; would she get that done; all in a hurry. They might be coming for the summer; had left everything to the last; expected to find things as they had left them. Slowly and painfully, with broom and pail, mopping, scouring, Mrs McNab, Mrs Bast, stayed the corruption and the rot; rescued from the pool of Time that was fast closing over them now a basin, now a cupboard; fetched up from oblivion all the Waverley novels and a tea-set one morning; in the afternoon restored to sun and air a brass fender and a set of steel fire-irons. George, Mrs Bast's son, caught the rats, and cut the grass. They had the builders. Attended with the creaking of hinges and the screeching of bolts, the slamming and banging of damp-swollen woodwork, some rusty laborious birth seemed to be taking place, as the women, stooping, rising, groaning, singing, slapped and slammed, upstairs now, now down in the cellars. Oh, they said, the work!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果那根羽毛落了下来，如果它使天平倾斜，这整幢房子就会栽进深渊，躺在那里被岁月遗忘：但是有一股力量在起作用；这是种并不十分有意识的力量；它侧目斜视、步履蹒珊；这种力量工作时并不为庄严的仪典或神圣的颂歌所鼓舞。迈克纳布太太呻吟抱怨；巴斯特太太一动就浑身吱嘎响。她们老了；她们动作不灵活了；她们的腿疼痛不已。她们终于拿着扫帚和提桶来了；她们动手干了起来。突然，年轻小姐中的一个写信来，迈克纳布太太是不是能把房子收拾好：她能不能做到这一点；能不能做到那一点；而且要赶紧办好；他们可能要来度夏；他们把什么都留到最后才来办；还指望什么都和他们离开的时候一样。迈克纳布太太和巴斯特太太缓慢地、吃力地用扫帚和提桶又拖地又擦洗，挡住了屋子继续朽烂下去：从岁月之潭中一会儿救出一只即将淹没的脸盆，一会儿又是一个碗柜；有一天早上她们从被遗忘的角落里拣出了那些韦弗利小说和一套茶具；下午又让一个铜壁炉围栏和一套钢质火炉用具重见了天日。巴斯特太太的儿子乔治负责捉老鼠、修剪草坪。她们找来了建筑工人，修好了吱嘎作响的铰链，吱扭吱扭的插销，受潮发胀的木器上撞得砰砰响的关不上的门。而这两个女人，一会儿弯腰、一会儿站起，呻吟着、唱着、兵兵砰砰，刚刚还在楼上，一会儿又到了地窖里，似乎这个地方正经历着一场缓慢艰难的新生。她们说，啊，这活真够呛！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For now had come that moment, that hesitation when dawn trembles and night pauses, when if a feather alight in the scale it will be weighed down. One feather, and the house, sinking, falling, would have turned and pitched downwards to the depths of darkness. In the ruined room, picnickers would have lit their kettles; lovers sought shelter there, lying on the bare boards; and the shepherd stored his dinner on the bricks, and the tramp slept with his coat round him to ward off the cold. Then the roof would have fallen; briars and hemlocks would have blotted out path, step and window; would have grown, unequally but lustily over the mound, until some trespasser, losing his way, could have told only by a red-hot poker among the nettles, or a scrap of china in the hemlock, that here once some one had lived; there had been a house.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was the cook now, Mildred, Marian, some such name as that -- a red- headed woman, quick-tempered like all her sort, but kind, too, if you knew the way with her. Many a laugh they had had together. She saved a plate of soup for Maggie; a bite of ham, sometimes; whatever was over. They lived well in those days. They had everything they wanted (glibly, jovially, with the tea hot in her, she unwound her ball of memories, sitting in the wicker arm-chair by the nursery fender). There was always plenty doing, people in the house, twenty staying sometimes, and washing up till long past midnight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在出现的是那个厨娘，米尔德里得，玛丽安，反正类似的这么个名字——一个红头发的女人，和所有红头发的人一样，性格急躁，可是如果你模熟了她的脾气的话，她也会非常和蔼。她们许多次在一起开怀大笑。她为玛吉留盘汤；有时候留点火腿；或者随便什么剩下来的东西。那时候他们日子过得很好。需要的东西什么都有（喝下了热茶，坐在育儿室壁炉围栏边的柳条扶手椅中，她毫不费力地、愉快地松开了记忆的线球）。那时总有许多活干，宅子里常常住着客人，有时候有二十个人住在这里，半夜过后好久还在洗餐具。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They drank their tea in the bedroom sometimes, or in the study; breaking off work at mid-day with the smudge on their faces, and their old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles. Flopped on chairs, they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps and bath; now the more arduous, more partial triumph over long rows of books, black as ravens once, now white-stained, breeding pale mushrooms and secreting furtive spiders. Once more, as she felt the tea warm in her, the telescope fitted itself to Mrs McNab's eyes, and in a ring of light she saw the old gentleman, lean as a rake, wagging his head, as she came up with the washing, talking to himself, she supposed, on the lawn. He never noticed her. Some said he was dead; some said she was dead. Which was it? Mrs Bast didn't know for certain either. The young gentleman was dead. That she was sure. She had read his name in the papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们有时在卧室或书房里喝茶；中午她们休息，脸上沾着污垢，年老的手因为老攥着扫帚把手指头都伸不直了。她们跌坐在椅子里，一会儿想到对水龙头和浴缸的辉煌征服；一会儿又想到对那长长的一排排的书的更为艰苦的部分胜利，那些书原来是乌黑的，现在长了白霉斑，生出了灰白的蘑菇，隐藏着诡秘的蜘蛛。迈克纳布太太感到喝下的茶使她浑身暖呼呼的，于是望远镜又一次自动放到了她眼前，她在一圈光亮中看到了那个瘦得像个耙子的老先生，当她拿着洗好的衣服走近时，见他摇头晃脑地在草坪上，想来是在自言自语。他从来没有注意过她。有人说他已经死了；又有人说是她死了。究竟死的是谁呢？巴斯特太大也说不准。那个少爷死了。这一点她是肯定的。她在报纸上看到过他的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It might well be, said Mrs McNab, wantoning on with her memories; they had friends in eastern countries; gentlemen staying there, ladies in evening dress; she had seen them once through the dining-room door all sitting at dinner. Twenty she dared say all in their jewellery, and she asked to stay help wash up, might be till after midnight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah, said Mrs Bast, they'd find it changed. She leant out of the window. She watched her son George scything the grass. They might well ask, what had been done to it? seeing how old Kennedy was supposed to have charge of it, and then his leg got so bad after he fell from the cart; and perhaps then no one for a year, or the better part of one; and then Davie Macdonald, and seeds might be sent, but who should say if they were ever planted? They'd find it changed.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now as if the cleaning and the scrubbing and the scything and the mowing had drowned it there rose that half-heard melody, that intermittent music which the ear half catches but lets fall; a bark, a bleat; irregular, intermittent, yet somehow related; the hum of an insect, the tremor of cut grass, disevered yet somehow belonging; the jar of a dorbeetle, the squeak of a wheel, loud, low, but mysteriously related; which the ear strains to bring together and is always on the verge of harmonising, but they are never quite heard, never fully harmonised, and at last, in the evening, one after another silence falls. With the sunset sharpness was lost, and like mist rising, quiet rose, quiet spread, the wind settled; loosely the world shook itself down to sleep, darkly here without a light to it, save what came green suffused through leaves, or pale on the white flowers in the bed by the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，好像一直被打扫、擦洗、用大镰刀和机器割草的声音所淹没的那隐隐约约的旋律又出现了，那时断时续的乐声虽然进入了人们的耳朵但未被人们注意；狗吠声，羊的咩咩声；没有规律、时断时续，然而却不知怎的相互关联；昆虫的鸣叫、割过的草的轻颤，彼此分开却又似乎亲密共属；金龟子刺耳的嗡嗡、车轮的吱嘎声，一高一低，却神秘的相互关联；耳朵使劲要把这些声音汇在一起，总是几乎就要达到和谐但却从来能完全听清、从未能达到完全的和谐。最后，到了黄昏十分，这些声音一个接着一个消失了，和声开始迟疑断续，寂静降临。随着日落，鲜明的轮廓消失了，宁静如薄雾般升起、四处弥漫，风停了；世界放松了，安顿下来睡觉了，在这儿一盏灯也没有，一片黑暗，只有透过树叶的绿光，或窗旁白色花朵上泛出的灰白。">查看中文翻译</div>
