<div class="line_en">It was a question, I am sure, equally to baffle Axl as he came wearily up the mountain slope. When the young girl had first mentioned the giant's cairn, he had pictured something atop a large mound. Yet this cairn had simply appeared before them on the incline, no feature around it to explain its presence. The goat, nonetheless, seemed immediately to sense its significance, struggling frantically as soon as the cairn had become visible as a dark finger against the sky. "It knows its fate," Sir Gawain had remarked, guiding his horse up with Beatrice in the saddle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of you will have fine monuments by which the living may remember the evil done to you. Some of you will have only crude wooden crosses or painted rocks, while yet others of you must remain hidden in the shadows of history. You are in any case part of an ancient procession, and so it is always possible the giant's cairn was erected to mark the site of some such tragedy long ago when young innocents were slaughtered in war. This aside, it is not easy to think of reasons for its standing. One can see why on lower ground our ancestors might have wished to commemorate a victory or a king. But why stack heavy stones to above a man's height in so high and remote a place as this?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你们有些人会有隆重的纪念碑，让活着的人记住你们受的罪。有些人只会有粗糙的木头十字架或者彩色石块，其他的人呢，就只能藏匿在历史的阴影中。无论如何，你们都是一个古老进程的一部分，所以当初立巨人冢，有可能就是为了纪念这个地方很久以前发生过的类似悲剧——年轻的无辜者在战争中遭到屠杀。除此之外，很难想到立此巨冢的其他原因。如果建在低一点的地方，我们的祖先也许是为了纪念一场胜利或一位国王。但是，为什么要选一个这么高、这么远的地方，把沉重的大石头堆得比一个人还高呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Master Axl, didn't our ways part years ago? Mine remained with Arthur, while yours…" He seemed now to become aware of Beatrice behind him, and turning, bowed politely. "Dear lady, I beg you let go this rope and rest. I'll not let the animal escape. Sit down beside the cairn there. It will shelter at least some part of you from this wind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“埃克索阁下，我们多年前不就已经分道扬镳了吗？我仍然跟着亚瑟，而你呢…”这时候，他似乎意识到比特丽丝在身后，于是他转过身，礼貌地鞠了个躬。“亲爱的女士，我请你放开绳子，休息吧。我不会让羊跑掉的。到那边的石冢旁坐下来。至少可以挡一挡风。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She began to make her way towards the cairn, and something about the way she did so, her shoulders hunched against the wind, caused a fragment of recollection to stir on the edges of Axl's mind. The emotion it provoked, even before he could hold it down, surprised and shocked him, for mingled with the overwhelming desire to go to her now and shelter her, were distinct shadows of anger and bitterness. She had talked of a long night spent alone, tormented by his absence, but could it be he too had known such a night, or even several, of similar anguish? Then, as Beatrice stopped before the cairn and bowed her head to the stones as if in apology, he felt both memory and anger growing firmer, and a fear made him turn away from her. Only then did he notice Sir Gawain also gazing over at Beatrice, a look of tenderness in his eyes, seemingly lost in his thoughts. But the knight soon collected himself, and coming closer to Axl, leant right down as though to remove any small chance of Beatrice overhearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她迈步朝石冢走去，身体前倾、肩膀缩着，以抵挡大风，那样子让埃克索隐隐约约回想起了什么往事。这在他心中激起了特殊的情感，还没来得及压制，就已经让他备感意外，甚至感到震惊，因为他一方面强烈渴望立即走到她身边，为她遮风挡雨，另一方面却又清晰地感受到了愤怒与怨恨。她说起过，某一个漫长的夜晚，她独自一人，因为他不在而备受煎熬。然而，有没有可能，他自己也曾有过某个同样痛苦的夜晚，甚至几个这样的夜晚？比特丽丝在石冢前停下来，对着那些石块低下头，好像道歉一样，这时他感到记忆更加清晰，愤怒也更加强烈了，一种恐惧感袭来，让他转过脸去不再看她。这时候他才注意到，高文爵士也在凝望着比特丽丝，眼里露出温柔的神情，似乎陷入了沉思。随后骑士回过神来，靠到埃克索身旁，弯下腰来，似乎是要排除一切被比特丽丝听到的可能。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who's to say your path wasn't the more godly?" he said. "To leave behind all great talk of war and peace. Leave behind that fine law to bring men closer to God. To leave behind Arthur once and for all and devote yourself to…" He glanced over again at Beatrice, who had remained on her feet, her forehead almost touching the piled stones in her effort to escape the wind. "To a good wife, sir. I've watched how she goes beside you as a kind shadow. Should I have done the same? Yet God guided us down separate paths. I had a duty. Ha! And do I fear him now? Never, sir, never. I accuse you of nothing. That great law you brokered torn down in blood! Yet it held well for a time. Torn down in blood! Who blames us for it now? Do I fear youth? Is it youth alone can defeat an opponent? Let him come, let him come. Remember it, sir! I saw you that very day and you talked of cries in your ears of children and babes. I heard the same, sir, yet were they not like the cries from the surgeon's tent when a man's life is spared even as the cure brings agonies? Yet I admit it. There are days I long for a kind shadow to follow me. Even now I turn in hope to see one. Doesn't every animal, every bird in the sky crave a tender companion? There were one or two I'd willingly have given my years. Why should I fear him now? I've fought fanged Norsemen with reindeer snouts, and they no masks! Here, sir, tie your goat now. How much deeper will you drive that stake? Is it a goat you tether or a lion?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你选的道路也许更加神圣，谁又敢说不是呢？”他说道。“丢开战争与和平的大事。丢开那条让人更亲近上帝的好法律。永远丢开亚瑟，一心去…”他又朝比特丽丝那边望了一眼，她仍旧站着，为了避开大风，额头几乎都要碰到那些堆砌起来的石块了。“一心去陪伴你的好妻子，先生。我注意到了，她在你身边走着，像一个温暖的影子。我当初也该这样做吗？可是，上帝将我们引上了不同的道路。我有职责。哈哈！现在我害怕他吗？不怕，先生，从没怕过。我对你没有任何指责。你帮助推行的那条伟大律法被撕碎了，沾满了血！但是，有一段时间，那法律的确生了效。撕碎了，沾满了血！现在谁为这事责怪我们呢？我害怕年轻吗？单凭年轻就能打败对手吗？让他来吧，让他来。这一点你记住，先生！那一天我亲眼见到了你，你说耳朵里有孩子和婴儿的哭声。我也听到啦，先生，可是那与医生帐篷里传出来的病人的哭声，有什么不同吗？治疗虽然带来痛苦，却能让一个人保住性命。但是，这一点我承认。有些日子里，我也希望有个温暖的影子跟着我。现在我一转身，还希望能看到一个呢。地上的每个动物、天上的每只鸟，不都渴望有温柔的伴侣吗？有那么一两个，为了她们，我倒愿意舍弃大好年华。我现在为什么要怕他？我斗过长着獠牙的挪威人，鼻子像驯鹿一样——那不是面具！给你，先生，把你的山羊拴好吧。你还要把那根桩砸多深啊？你这是要拴山羊还是拴狮子？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Axl, one knee pressed into the grass, tied the rope tightly around the notch in the wood, then looked once more over to his wife. She was standing at the cairn much as before, and though something in her posture again tugged at him, he was relieved to find in himself no trace of the earlier bitterness. Instead he felt almost overcome by an urge to defend her, not just from the harsh wind, but from something else large and dark even then gathering around them. He rose and hurried to her.</div>

The sky had thickened, so that to Axl it was as if the newcomers had been carried here on the clouds. Now both of them, in near-silhouette, appeared peculiarly transfixed: the warrior holding firm his rein in both hands like a charioteer; the boy leaning forward at an angle, both arms outstretched as though for balance.

Meanwhile the boy himself remained oblivious. He calmed somewhat, but his gaze stayed fixed on the rocks at the top of the slope, and he continued to tug with quiet insistence.

This time Axl and Beatrice did not fall behind, for a sense of solemnity seemed to descend on Gawain and Wistan, making them proceed in front at an almost ceremonial pace. In any case, the ground had become less demanding, levelling to something like a plateau. The rocks they had discussed from below now loomed before them, and Axl could see, as they came ever nearer, how they were arranged in a rough semi-circle around the top of a mound to the side of their path. He could see too how a row of smaller stones rose in a kind of stairway up the side of the mound, leading right up to the rim of what could only be a pit of significant depth. The grass all around where they had now arrived seemed to have been blackened or burnt, lending the surroundings -- already without tree or shrub -- an atmosphere of decay.

<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索扶着妻子站到身旁一块突出的地方，然后俯身到岩石上看。下面的坑比他想象的更宽、更浅——不像是真正从地上挖出来的，更像一个干枯的水塘。大半个坑被暗淡的阳光照着，似乎全是灰色的石头和沙砾——到边缘兀然变成了焦黑的草——因此除了龙之外，眼睛能看见的唯一的活东西，是一片孤零零的山楂树丛，从坑内深处正中央的那块石头里冒出来，非常惹眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for the dragon, it was hardly clear at first she was alive. Her posture -- prone, head twisted to one side, limbs outspread -- might easily have resulted from her corpse being hurled into the pit from a height. In fact it took a moment to ascertain this was a dragon at all: she was so emaciated she looked more some worm-like reptile accustomed to water that had mistakenly come aground and was in the process of dehydrating. Her skin, which should have appeared oiled and of a colour not unlike bronze, was instead a yellowing white, reminiscent of the underside of certain fish. The remnants of her wings were sagging folds of skin that a careless glance might have taken for dead leaves accumulated to either side of her. The head being turned against the grey pebbles, Axl could see only the one eye, which was hooded in the manner of a turtle's, and which opened and closed lethargically according to some internal rhythm. This movement, and the faintest rise and fall along the creature's backbone, were the only indicators that Querig was still alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于龙呢，一开始几乎很难判断是死是活。她俯身卧着，脑袋扭在一边，四肢伸开，这姿势让人觉得是具尸体，被人从高处扔进了坑里。实际上，要确定这是条龙，都要花点时间：她瘦弱不堪，看起来更像个虫子一样的爬行动物，习惯了水里的生活，却阴差阳错爬上了岸，现在正脱水呢。她的皮肤本该油滑光亮，有着青铜一样的色泽，现在却白得发黄，让人想起某种鱼的肚子。残剩的翅膀不过是一层层耷拉着的皮，不仔细看的话，会以为是龙身体两侧堆积的树叶。龙的脑袋扭向与灰色砾石相对的那一侧，所以埃克索只能看到一只眼睛，上面有海龟那样的眼皮罩着，无精打采地一睁一闭，遵循着某种内在节奏。这一动作，加上脊背的微微起伏，是魁瑞格仍旧活着的仅有迹象。">查看中文翻译</div>

A dark man he may have been, but in this he did God's will, not only Arthur's. Without this she-dragon's breath, would peace ever have come? Look how we live now, sir! Old foes as cousins, village by village. Master Wistan, you fall silent before this sight. I ask again. Will you not leave this poor creature to live out her life? Her breath isn't what it was, yet holds the magic even now. Think, sir, once that breath should cease, what might be awoken across this land even after these years! Yes, we slaughtered plenty, I admit it, caring not who was strong and who weak. God may not have smiled at us, but we cleansed the land of war. Leave this place, sir, I beg you.

<div class="line_en">At first both men held their swords pointing downwards, so as not to exhaust their arms. From his vantage point, Axl could see their positions clearly: at most five strides apart, Wistan's body angled slightly to the left away from his opponent's. They held these positions for a time, then Wistan moved three slow steps to his right, so that to all appearances, his outside shoulder was no longer protected by his sword. But to take advantage, Gawain would have had to close the gap very rapidly, and Axl was hardly surprised when the knight, gazing accusingly at the warrior, himself moved to the right with deliberate strides. Wistan meanwhile changed the grip of both his hands on his sword, and Axl could not be sure Gawain had noticed the change -- Wistan's body possibly obscuring the knight's view. But now Gawain too was changing his hold, letting the sword's weight fall from the right arm to the left. Then the two men became fixed in their new positions, and to an innocent spectator, they may have looked, in relation to one another, practically unchanged from before. Yet Axl could sense that these new positions had a different significance. It had been a long time since he had had to consider combat in such detail, and there remained a frustrating sense that he was failing to see half of what was unfolding before him. But he knew somehow the contest had reached a critical point; that things could not be held like this for long without one or the other combatant being forced to commit himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, he was taken aback by the suddenness with which Gawain and Wistan met. It was as if they had responded to a signal: the space between them vanished, and the two were suddenly locked in tense embrace. It happened so quickly it appeared to Axl the men had abandoned their swords and were now holding one another in a complicated and mutual armlock. As they did so, they rotated a little, like dancers, and Axl could then see that their two blades, perhaps because of the huge impact of their coming together, had become melded as one. Both men, mortified by this turn of events, were now doing their best to prise the weapons apart. But this was no easy task, and the old knight's features were contorted with the effort. Wistan's face, for the moment, was not visible, but Axl could see the warrior's neck and shoulders shaking as he too did all he could to reverse the calamity. But their efforts were in vain: with each moment, the two swords seemed to fasten more thoroughly, and surely there was nothing for it but to abandon the weapons and start the contest afresh. Neither man, though, appeared willing to give up, even as the effort threatened to drain them of their strength. Then something gave and the blades came apart. As they did so, some dark grain -- perhaps the substance that had caused the blades to fasten together in the first place -- flew up into the air between them. Gawain, with a look of astonished relief, reeled halfway round and sank to one knee. Wistan, for his part, had been carried by the momentum into turning a near circle, and had come to a halt pointing his now liberated sword towards the clouds beyond the cliff, his back fully turned to the knight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管如此，高文和维斯坦交手之突然还是让埃克索吃了一惊。好像有人对他们同时发出了信号一样，两人之间的距离消失了，刹那之间，他们已紧紧抱在一起。事情在电光火石之间发生，在埃克索看来，两人似乎抛开了剑，张开臂膀以复杂的动作锁住了对方。与此同时，两人略微旋转了一下，像跳舞一样，这时候埃克索看到，两人的剑似乎融在了一起，也许是因为两柄剑撞击的力量太大吧。这让两人都觉得尴尬，正尽最大努力，要把武器拉开。但这可不是容易的事情，老骑士拼尽气力，脸上表情都扭曲了。维斯坦的脸这时看不见，但埃克索看到他的脖子和肩膀都在颤抖，显然他也在尽全力扭转这一僵局。可是，他们的努力似乎都白费了：时间越久，两柄剑似乎就粘得更牢，看来没别的办法，只好抛开武器，重新开始战斗了。不过，两人好像都不愿意放弃，尽管这样拼命，简直要把力气耗光。接着，某根弦崩断，两柄剑瞬间分开。剑刃分开时，黑色的尘埃——让剑刃紧紧粘在一起的，也许就是这种物质——从中间腾起，飞向空中。高文脸上露出惊讶而又欣慰的表情，他身体转了半个圈子，单膝跪在地上。维斯坦被这股大力推动，几乎转了整整一圈，停下来的时候，用重获自由的剑指着悬崖之外的云，背部正好对着骑士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"God protect him," Beatrice said beside him, and Axl realised she had been watching all the while. When he looked down again, Gawain had lowered his other knee to the ground. Then the tall figure of the knight fell slowly, twistingly, onto the dark grass. There he struggled a moment, like a man in his sleep trying to make himself more comfortable, and when his face was turned to the sky, even though his legs were still folded untidily beneath him, Gawain seemed content. As Wistan approached with a concerned stride, the old knight appeared to say something, but Axl was too far to hear. The warrior remained standing over his opponent for some time, his sword held forgotten at his side, and Axl could see dark drops falling from the tip of the blade onto the soil.</div>

<div class="line_en">He pressed Beatrice close to him. Then releasing her, he climbed down a little way to where he could see better Gawain's body lying on the earth. Wistan had been correct: the blood had flowed only to where the ground rose in a kind of lip at the cliff's edge, and was pooling there with no danger of spilling over. The sight caused a melancholy to sweep over him, but also -- though it was a distant and vague one -- the feeling that some great anger within him had at long last been answered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Down in the pit, neither the dragon's position nor posture had changed: if her senses were warning her of the proximity of strangers -- and of one in particular making his way down the steep side of the pit -- Querig gave no indication of it. Or could it be the rise and fall of her spine had become a little more pronounced? And was there a new urgency in the hooded eye as it opened and shut? Axl could not be sure. But as he continued to gaze down at the creature, the idea came to him that the hawthorn bush -- the only other thing alive in the pit -- had become a source of great comfort to her, and that even now, in her mind's eye, she was reaching for it. Axl realised the idea was fanciful, yet the more he watched, the more credible it seemed. For how was it a solitary bush was growing in a place like this? Could it not be that Merlin himself had allowed it to grow here, so that the dragon would have a companion?</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Wistan was safely on the ground. He wiped his forehead, glanced up at Axl and Beatrice, then moved towards the dragon, stopping several strides away. He then raised his sword and began to scrutinise the blade, apparently taken aback to discover it streaked with blood. For several moments, Wistan remained like this, not moving, so that Axl wondered if the strange mood that had overtaken the warrior since his victory had momentarily made him forget his reason for entering the pit.</div>

<div class="line_en">But then with something of the unexpectedness that had characterised his contest with the old knight, Wistan suddenly moved forward. He did not run, but walked briskly, stepping over the dragon's body without breaking stride, and hurried on as though anxious to reach the other side of the pit. But his sword had described a swift, low arc in passing, and Axl saw the dragon's head spin into the air and roll a little way before coming to rest on the stony ground. It did not remain there long, however, for it was soon engulfed by the rich tide that first parted around it, then buoyed it up till it swam glidingly across the floor of the pit. It came to a stop at the hawthorn, where it lodged, the throat up to the sky. The sight brought back to Axl the head of the monster dog Gawain had severed in the tunnel, and again a melancholy threatened to sweep over him. He made himself look away from the dragon, and watch instead the figure of Wistan, who had not stopped walking. The warrior was now circling back, avoiding the ever-spreading pool, and then with his sword still unsheathed, began the climb out of the pit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，与之前和老骑士战斗时一样，维斯坦突然开始向前移动。他没有跑，而是快步走，人从龙的身体上越过，但步伐并没有紊乱，然后他加快了脚步，好像急着赶到坑的另一侧一样。但是，在此过程中，他的剑划了一道又急又低的弧线，埃克索看见母龙的脑袋飞到空中，滚了几下，最后在石头地上停住不动了。不过，脑袋并没有在地上停多久，汹涌的血液先在脑袋两侧分开流过，随后脑袋便浮了起来，在坑底快速漂过去，到山楂树丛那儿停了下来，卡住不动了，喉咙朝上向着天空。这场景让埃克索想起了高文在地道里砍下来的那条狗怪的脑袋，心中又感到一阵凄凉。他强迫自己扭过头去，不看母龙，而去看维斯坦的身形：他一直在走，从没停下脚步。这时候武士一边避开漫延的血池，一边绕路回来，到了坑边，开始往上爬，手里的剑仍然没有放回剑鞘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Surely you speak in the confusion of your victory, Master Wistan," Beatrice said. "How can this be? You see yourself how in these parts it's your kin and mine mingle village by village. Who among them would turn on neighbours loved since childhood?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说这话，大概是刚才取得了胜利，昏了头吧，维斯坦阁下，”比特丽丝说。“这怎么可能呢？你自己亲眼看到了，这儿的每个村庄，你的同胞和我的同胞都生活在一起。从小就爱着的邻居，他们怎么可能去下手呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's true our armies are yet meagre in numbers, even in the fenlands. Yet look across this whole land. In every valley, beside every river, you'll now find Saxon communities, and each with strong men and growing boys. It's from these we'll swell our ranks even as we come sweeping westward."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，我们的军队在数量上还很单薄，连东方的沼泽地也不例外。但是，你看看这片土地。每个山谷、每条河流，现在都有撒克逊人的村庄，每个村庄都有强壮的汉子和即将长大的男孩。我们的军队横扫西方之时，这些村庄的人会壮大我们的力量。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yet see your husband's face, mistress. He begins to understand why I sit here as before a light too fierce for my gaze."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，你看看你丈夫的脸。我坐在这儿，好像面前有让人无法睁眼的强光一样，为什么呢？你丈夫已经开始明白了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right enough, princess, the warrior's words make me tremble. You and I longed for Querig's end, thinking only of our own dear memories. Yet who knows what old hatreds will loosen across the land now? We must hope God yet finds a way to preserve the bonds between our peoples, yet custom and suspicion have always divided us. Who knows what will come when quick-tongued men make ancient grievances rhyme with fresh desire for land and conquest?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，公主，武士的话让我不寒而栗。我和你希望魁瑞格死掉，我们只想着自己的宝贵记忆。可是，多少古老的仇恨将在这块土地上复活，谁又知道呢？我们只好希望上帝能找到办法，维系两族之间的纽带，可习俗与猜忌一直让我们难以团结。如果对土地和征服的新欲望，被巧舌之辈嫁接到古老的怨恨之上，谁知道会带来什么灾祸呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Can he be right, Axl? Surely he speaks in a fever?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他说得对吗，埃克索？他肯定是头脑发热，才这么说的吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He may yet be mistaken, princess, but this is no fever. The she-dragon's no more, and Arthur's shadow will fade with her." Then to Wistan, he said: "I'm comforted at least, sir, to find you take no delight in these horrors you paint."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他有可能说错了，公主，但这不是头脑发热。母龙死了，亚瑟长长的影子也会慢慢消失。”然后他对维斯坦说：“我感到欣慰，先生，你描述的这些可怕景象，至少你自己没有引以为乐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How right to fear it, sir," Wistan said. "The giant, once well buried, now stirs. When soon he rises, as surely he will, the friendly bonds between us will prove as knots young girls make with the stems of small flowers. Men will burn their neighbours' houses by night. Hang children from trees at dawn. The rivers will stink with corpses bloated from their days of voyaging. And even as they move on, our armies will grow larger, swollen by anger and thirst for vengeance. For you Britons, it'll be as a ball of fire rolls towards you. You'll flee or perish. And country by country, this will become a new land, a Saxon land, with no more trace of your people's time here than a flock or two of sheep wandering the hills untended."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“惧怕就对啦，先生，”维斯坦说。“巨人，以前埋在地下，现在动起来啦。他肯定很快就会起来，到那时候，我们之间的友好纽带，就会像小女孩用细细的花茎打的结一样，脆弱不堪。人们会在夜间烧掉邻居的房子。清晨将孩子们吊死在树上。河水发臭，河上漂着泡了很多天的肿胀尸体。我们的军队一面推进，一面会因为愤怒和复仇的渴望而继续壮大。对你们不列颠人来说，那将是向你们滚去的一个大火球。你们要么逃跑，要么毁灭。一个个国家会相继沦陷，这儿会成为一块全新的土地，撒克逊人的土地，没有痕迹表明你们曾在这儿生活过，除了一两群无人照看的绵羊，在山里游荡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You speak of Master Edwin, sir?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说的是埃德温阁下，先生？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd take delight if I could, Master Axl, for it'll be vengeance justly served. Yet I'm enfeebled by my years among you, and try as I will, a part of me turns from the flames of hatred. It's a weakness shames me, yet I'll soon offer in my place one trained by my own hand, one with a will far cleaner than mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我能够的话，埃克索阁下，我会引以为乐的，因为那将是正当的复仇。但是，我在你们当中生活得太久，变得软弱了，就算我努力，心中也有个声音反对这仇恨的火焰。这是个弱点，让我感到羞耻，但我很快会用我亲手训练出来的人代替我的位置，他的意志比我要纯粹得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do, and I dare say he'll be growing quickly more calm now the dragon's slain and her pull gone from him. That boy has a true warrior's spirit given only to a few. The rest he'll learn fast enough, and I'll train his heart well to admit no soft sentiments as have invaded mine. He'll show no mercy in our work ahead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，现在母龙被杀，对他的影响也就没了，我敢说他很快就会更加镇定。那个男孩有真正的武士精神，这样的人很少。其余的他很快就能学会，我会锻炼他的心，不允许他像我这样，被柔弱的情感侵入。在我们未来的事业中，他将毫不留情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Master Wistan," Beatrice said, "I still don't know if you speak only in a mad fever. But my husband and I grow weak, and must return to lower ground and shelter. Will you remember your promise to bury well the gentle knight?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“维斯坦阁下，”比特丽丝说，“我还是不知道，你这究竟是不是头脑发热的疯话。但我和我丈夫体力越来越弱，我们必须回到下面去找地方休息了。你能记住你的承诺，好好埋葬这位好心的骑士吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I promise to do so, mistress, though I fear even now the birds find him. Good friends, forewarned as you are, you've time enough to escape. Take the knight's horse and ride fast from these parts. Seek your son's village if you must, but linger there no more than a day or two, for who knows how soon the flames will be lit before our coming armies. If your son will not hear your warnings, leave him and flee as far west as you can. You may yet keep ahead of the slaughter. Go now and find the knight's horse. And should you find Master Edwin much calmed, his strange fever passed, cut him free and bid him come up here to me. A fierce future now opens before him, and it's my wish he sees this place, the fallen knight and the broken she-dragon, all before his next steps. Besides, I recall how well he digs a grave with a stray stone or two! Now hurry away, gentle friends, and farewell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我承诺，夫人，不过我担心那些鸟现在就找到了他。好朋友们，你们提前获得了警告，有足够的时间逃走。坐上骑士的马，快点离开这儿吧。如果一定要去，那就去找你们儿子的村庄吧，但最多逗留一两天，在我们的军队到来之前，谁知道村子里什么时候会烧起战火呢？你们的儿子如果不肯听从你们的警告，那就丢下他，尽可能往西边跑。你们还有可能跑在屠杀前头。现在就去吧，找到骑士的马。如果你们发现埃德温阁下镇定多了，奇怪的烧退去了，那就把他放开，让他上来找我。他未来要经历大风大浪，我希望他看看这个地方，看看倒下的骑士和死掉的母龙，统统在他脚下。而且，现在我想起来了，他能用一两块石头挖坟呢！好啦，快点走吧，好心的朋友们，就此别过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
