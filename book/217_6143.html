<div class="line_en">We dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again.</div>

<div class="line_en">First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.</div>

<div class="line_en">And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeitmoney business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. ("House to rob, you mean," says I to myself; "and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft – and you'll have to take it out in wondering.") And he said if he warn't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.</div>

<div class="line_en">So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway – and maybe a chance for THE chance on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again.

<div class="line_en">Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd GOT to be a slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of ME! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, "There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我曾经心里想，杰姆要是注定做奴隶的话，在家乡做要比在外地强一千倍。在家乡，他有家啊。为此，我曾经想，不妨由我写封信给汤姆·索亚，要他把杰姆目前的情况告诉华珍小姐。不过我很快就放弃了这个念头。原因有两个。她准定会发火，又气又恨，认为他不该如此忘恩负义，竟然从她那儿逃跑。这样，她会干脆把他卖掉，再一次把他卖到下游去。如果她不是这么干，大伙儿自然会一个个都瞧不起忘恩负义的黑奴，他们势必会叫杰姆时时刻刻意识到这一点，搞得他狼狈不堪、无地自容。并且再胂胛易约喊桑『芸毂慊岽？？饷匆？个说法，说赫克·芬出力帮助一个黑奴重获自由。这样，要是我再见到这个镇子上的随便哪一个人，我肯定会羞愧得无地自容，愿意趴在地下求饶。一般的情况往往是这样的嘛。一个人一旦做了什么下流的勾当，可是又并不想承担什么责任，自以为只要把事情遮盖起来，这多么丢人现眼啊。这恰恰正是我的情况。我越是想到这件事，我的良心越是受到折磨，我也就越是觉得自己邪恶、下流、不出息。到后来，我突然之间猛然醒悟了，认识到这明明是上帝的手在打我的耳光，让我明白，我的种种邪恶，始终逃不开在上天的眼睛。一个可怜的老妇人平生从没有损害过我一根毫毛，我却把她的黑奴拐跑，为了这个，上帝正指引着我，让我明白什么都逃不过“他”那高悬的明镜，“他”决不允许这类不幸的事再发展下去，只能到此为止。一想到这一些，我差一点儿就立刻跌倒在地，我委实吓得不得了啦。于是我就想方设法，试图为自己开脱。我对自个儿说：我从小就是在邪恶的环境中长大的，因此不能过于怪罪我啊。不过，在我的心里，还有另一个声音在不停地说，“还有主日学校哩。你本该到那儿去啊。要是你早去的话，他们会在那儿教导你的嘛，教导你说，谁要象我那样为了黑奴所干的这一切，是要下地狱受到永恒的烈火的熬煎的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可是个叫人左右为难的事啊。我把纸拣了起来，拿在手里。我在发抖。因为我得在两条路中选择一条，而且永远也不能反悔。这是我深深知道的。我认真考虑了一分钟，并且几乎屏住了气考虑的，随后我对自个儿说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可是可怕的念头，可怕的话语啊，不过我就是这么说了。并且我既然说出了口，我就从没有想过要改邪归正。我把整个儿这件事从脑袋里统统赶了出去。我说，我要重新走邪恶这一条路，这是我的本行，从小就这样长大的嘛。走别的路就不内行了。作为开头第一件事，我要去活动起来，把杰姆从奴隶的境地给偷出来。要是我还能想出比这更为邪恶的主意，我也会照干不误。因为既然我是干的这一行，那么，只要有利，我便要干到底。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后我就琢磨着该怎样下手。我在心里盘算过好多条路子，最后定下了一个最适合于我的计划。接下来，我认准了大河下游一处林木森森的小岛，等到天一黑，我便把木筏子偷偷划到那一边去，把木筏子就藏在那里，然后钻进窝棚去。我睡了整整一个晚上，天蒙蒙亮前爬了起来，吃过了早饭，穿上了我那套现成的新衣服，把一些零星东西打成一捆，坐上独木小舟，就划到对岸去了。我在据我判断是费尔贝斯家的下边上了岸，把我的一捆东西藏在林子里，接着把独木舟灌满了水，装满了石块沉到了水里去。沉下去的地方是我需要时能找到的去处，离岸上那家小小的机器锯木厂，有四分之一英里地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just yet – I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch – three-night performance – like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后我就上了路。我走过锯木厂的时候，看到了一块牌子“费尔贝斯锯木厂”。又走了两三百码，就走到了农庄了。附近没有见到什么人，尽管天已经大亮了。不过我对这些并不在意，因为我暂时还不想见到什么人——我只想看看这一带的地形。按照我原来的计划，我本应该是从下游不远的一个村子来的。因此我只是随便看了一眼，就径直往镇子走去。啊，一到那里，我第一个遇见的人却是公爵。他正在张贴一张《王室异兽》的海报——只演三个晚上——跟早先一个样。他们还是这么死不要脸——这些骗子！我刚好跟他面对面，躲也躲不及了。我仿佛大吃一惊。他说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what DID become of the raft, then? – and Jim – poor Jim!" "Blamed if I know – that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.'"</div>

He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says: "The man that bought him is named Abram Foster – Abram G. Foster – and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette." "All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days. And I'll start this very afternoon." "No you wont, you'll start NOW; and don't you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.
