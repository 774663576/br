<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie stands by the window. It'll soon be dawn. Somebody has turned out the lights in the pizzeria and gone to bed again, in the hope that Britt-Marie won't be banging on her door because she needs peanut butter and chocolate. The party is long since over. The road lies deserted. Britt-Marie rubs her wedding ring with a potato smeared with baking soda, because that is the best way to clean wedding rings. She often does that with Kent's wedding ring; he often leaves it on his bedside table. He's often so distracted, Kent is, whenever he's about to meet with the Germans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽站在窗前。拂晓几乎已经到来，坐轮椅的女人关掉了披萨店里所有的灯，继续睡觉去了，只希望布里特—玛丽不会再为了花生酱和巧克力来砸她的门。披萨店昨晚的派对早已结束，马路上空无一人。布里特—玛丽拿起一块涂了小苏打的土豆，揉擦着她的结婚戒指，因为这是清理婚戒的最佳方法，她经常这样清理肯特的结婚戒指，他经常把它遗忘在他那边的床头柜上，因为每当需要和德国人见面的时候，他总是心不在焉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie usually cleans the ring until it gleams, so he won't be able to avoid noticing it when he gets out of bed the next morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie tries to sound sure of herself. The rat licks its feet. Makes a little semi-loop on the napkin. Then dashes out of the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie doesn't know if it thinks she talks too much. Doesn't know why it keeps coming here. The supply of Snickers, obviously, but she hopes there's something more to it. She takes the plate and puts plastic wrap over the remains of the peanut butter and Nutella, then puts everything in the fridge out of an old habit, because she's not one to throw away food. She wipes her wedding ring carefully and folds it in a piece of paper towel before tucking it into her jacket pocket. It'll be nice to take off the bandage and put the ring back on her finger. Like getting into her own bed after a long journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不知道老鼠是否嫌她啰嗦，也不知道它为什么坚持到娱乐中心来，大概是为了士力架。然而她希望它不仅仅是为了士力架才来。她端走盘子，用保鲜膜裹住里面的花生酱和可可酱，然后把盘子放进冰箱。这是她的老习惯，因为她不会轻易丢弃食物。她再次仔细地擦了擦自己的婚戒，用纸巾包好，塞进外套口袋。摘掉绷带、重新戴上婚戒时的感觉一定会很不错，就像长途旅行归来后睡到自己的床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sami told me I'm not the type to clear off, but you have to understand that that is most certainly exactly what I am. Whichever way I turn, I'm leaving someone behind. So the only thing that's right must be to blasted well stay where you belong. In your normal life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“萨米告诉我，我不是那种甩手不管的人。可你必须明白，我其实就是这样的，无论我选择怎样的生活，都会有人被我甩在身后。所以唯一正确的做法，也许就是乖乖回到原地，回到正常的生活中去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A normal life -- she has never wanted anything but a normal life. She could have made other choices, she tells herself, but she chose Kent. A human being may not choose her circumstances, but she does choose her actions, she insists quietly to herself. Sami was right. She's not the kind that clears off. So she must go home, where she is needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正常生活——她只想要正常生活。她本可以做出其他选择，她告诉自己，但她最终选择肯特。一个人或许无法选择环境，但她可以针对环境选择采取什么样的行动，她冷静地劝说自己。萨米说得对，她不是那种甩手不管的人，所以她必须回家，那里需要她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wonders how much space a person has left in her soul to change herself, once she gets older. What people does she still have to meet, what will they see in her, and what will they make her see in herself?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想知道，一个人在老去之后，灵魂中还剩下多少自我改变的空间，还会遇到什么样的人，他们会怎么看待她，会如何让她认清自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She sits on the stool in the kitchen, staring at the wall and waiting for a black car. It does not come. She wonders if Sami thinks about how one should live one's life, if he has ever had that luxury. A human being can't choose his circumstances, admittedly, but in Sami's life there have been more circumstances than events. She asks herself if choices or circumstances make us the sort of people we become -- or what it was that made Sami the sort of person who steps in. She wonders what takes the most out of a person: to be the kind that jumps, or the kind that doesn't?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐在厨房里，凝视着墙壁，等待一辆黑色的汽车。它还没有来。她想知道萨米觉得人应该如何生活，如果他拥有这种奢侈的话。一个人显然无法选择环境，而且在萨米的人生中，环境的决定性明显大于各种偶然事件。她想知道，是选择还是环境让每一个人变成了现在的模样——或者说是什么因素造就了如今的萨米。她想知道怎样做对一个人最好：成为敢跳的人，还是不敢跳的人？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sami went to town to protect someone who doesn't deserve it, and Britt-Marie is getting ready to go home for the same reason. Because if we don't forgive those we love, then what is left? What is love if it's not loving our lovers even when they don't deserve it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨米去了镇上，去保护某个值得他保护的人。为了同样的原因，布里特—玛丽也做好了回家的准备，因为如果我们连自己爱的人都不原谅，人生中还能剩下什么？如果我们做不到爱他们——即使他们并不值得我们爱——爱何以称其为爱？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, when people speak of it, it will be said that a few young men found Magnus in the early hours of morning, standing outside a bar. One of them was holding a knife. Another man stepped in between them. He was the kind that always steps in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，每当谈起这件事，人们会说：某天凌晨，几个年轻人在一家酒吧外面找到了马格努斯，其中一个年轻人带着刀。就在这时，一个男人走过来，站在了这群人和马格努斯之间，他是那种总喜欢插手管闲事的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They slow down by the bus stop. Turn off into the graveled parking area. Britt-Marie is already standing in the doorway.</div>

<div class="line_en">The car stops gently on the gravel. Makes a little warm sigh as the engine is turned off. The headlights are switched off at the same time as the pizzeria lights are turned on. In certain types of communities people always know what it means when cars stop outside their windows before dawn. People know it is never because something good has happened. Somebody comes rolling onto the porch; her wheelchair stops at once when she sees the police uniform.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车缓缓停在砾石地面上，引擎在关闭之前发出一声轻柔的叹息。头灯熄灭后，披萨店的灯光随即亮起，在某些特定类型的社区里，如果有汽车在黎明之前开过来，停在自己的窗外，居民们总能猜出这意味着什么，肯定不会是什么好事。坐轮椅的女人已经摇着轮椅出现在了门廊里，看到警察的制服时，她的动作停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sven stands with his cap in both hands and his bottom lip full of teeth marks, caused by his attempt to hold it all in. Despair, which has run down his cheeks and caused red lines, speaks volumes about just how futile his attempt has been.</div>
