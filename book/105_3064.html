<div class="line_en">"This way." Tristan began to walk around the cottage, away from the lake. Dylan took one last look at the water. Today it seemed calm and peaceful, the surface gently rippling, causing sparkles where the sun tickled the tiny wave-crests. She remembered the horrors that lurked beneath and shuddered, racing after Tristan as if she could leave the bad memories behind. He had paused on the other side of the cottage, waiting for her. He stood casually, staring into the distance with one hand up at his forehead, shading the glare from the sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ready for the final bit of the journey?" Tristan asked, forcing humour into his voice. They were standing outside the cottage, preparing to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最后一段旅程，准备好了吗？”崔斯坦问道，努力让自己的声音显得轻松幽默。他们站在小屋外，准备上路了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See that?" Dylan looked in the direction that Tristan was gazing. The landscape was flat and bare. A small stream trickled its way towards the horizon, snaking lazily away from them. On the left side of the stream, a path wound parallel to the water and, besides a few bushes, there was nothing else to see. Dylan raised one eyebrow, puzzled. "Er, nope."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看到了吗？”迪伦顺着崔斯坦的目光望去，前面是空空荡荡的一马平川。一条涓涓细流从他们身边蜿蜒蛇行，朝着地平线流去。水流左侧有一条与它平行的小路。除此之外，除了几片灌木丛，就什么也看不到了。迪伦一边的眉毛扬起，困惑地说：“呃，什么也看不见啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦，那儿真的什么也没有。我应该能看到什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shrugged. "I told you, I've never been. This has always been as far as I've gone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他耸耸肩，“告诉你吧，我也从来没去过。这就是我到过的最远的地方了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her tone made him turn to face her. He grinned and rolled his eyes. "Look harder."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh," she said. "And then what happens?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，”她说，“然后又会发生什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan squinted. The horizon was very far away. She could kind of make out a bit of a glow where the land met the blue sky, but it could easily be a trick of the light, or just the fact that she was trying to see something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦眯起眼睛观望。地平线看上去非常遥远，她只能隐隐约约在蓝天与大地的交界处看到一些东西在微微闪烁，这也有可能是阳光下的幻影，或者根本就是自己使劲地盯着一个地方看后产生的错觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not really," she answered honestly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是很清楚。”她老老实实地回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sighed at her, but Dylan could tell he was enjoying feeling superior. He moved behind her and leaned over her shoulder. His breath tickled her neck, setting her skin on fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对着她叹了口气，但迪伦能感觉得到他正在为自己的这种优越感沾沾自喜。他走到迪伦身后，靠着她的肩膀。他的呼吸让她的脖子痒痒的，皮肤火辣辣的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“看着地平线。”他指向前方，“看到那微微闪光的地方了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked at her incredulously. When he spoke he was clearly holding back laughter. "You think an enormous escalator descends from the sky?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起。”崔斯坦笑得很腼腆，“通常他们走到这儿之后就消失了。就是这样，他们往前迈出一步，然后就会消失。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well I don't know," she huffed, embarrassed and covering it with anger.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come on, we've got to get started," Tristan gave her a little push in the back to get her moving. She looked at the horizon again, straining her eyes at the so-called shimmer. Could she see it? It was hard to tell. It was, however, giving her a headache so she gave up and settled for gazing moodily at the path in front of them. It looked far. Not up hill, at least, but far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来吧，我们得上路了。”崔斯坦在背后轻轻推了迪伦一把，催促她动身。迪伦又看了一眼地平线，使劲地盯着那个所谓的闪光处。她能看见吗？太难辨认了。她看了会儿只觉得头疼，索性不再理会，只有悻悻地望着他们前方的那条小路。至少不用再爬山了，但目的地依然遥不可及。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan wrinkled her nose. She could tell that he was speaking the truth, but it wasn't very helpful.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As it's the last day," she started hopefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“反正是最后一天了……”她满怀希望地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know, I almost drowned yesterday," she continued, sure that he wouldn't relent and carry her, but miserable at the thought of marching all the way across the plain. And the drowning had taken a lot out of her. Her legs were stiff, and her chest ached. Her throat was raw from vomiting up the water and the constant coughing to clear her lungs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要知道，我昨天几乎淹死哎。”她继续唠叨着，心里清楚他才不会善心大发背自己呢，但一想到还要长途跋涉穿过平原就苦不堪言。昨天的溺水耗费了很大的体力，现在她双腿僵硬，胸口疼痛，喉咙因为昨天吐了很多水，加上不停地咳嗽，依然刺痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am not giving you a piggy-back," Tristan answered quickly, not even letting her finish the sentence. He overtook her slouching pace, striding off ahead. Grumbling, Dylan stomped after him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不会背你的。”崔斯坦话都没让迪伦说完就打断了她。他超过了走路没精打采的迪伦，大步流星地向前走。迪伦一边小声抱怨，一边拖着沉重的脚步在后面跟着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I could have died, again?" she asked, confused. Surely dead was dead?</div>

<div class="line_en">He nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" she asked sharply. He looked up at the sky, took a deep breath, and turned to face her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说什么？”她突然问道。他抬头看着天空，深吸了一口气，然后转过头面对着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Each word was spoken slowly and clearly, and each stabbed straight into Dylan's brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一个词都说得慢而清晰，每一个词都像一把匕首径直刺进迪伦的大脑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But how? Where would I have gone? I don't…" Dylan tailed off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怎么能再死一次呢？死后又会去哪里呢？我没有……”迪伦的话说到最后突然吞吞吐吐的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他回头看着她，脸上露出奇怪的表情，但随即还是转身继续走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan stared off into space, aghast at how close she had come to oblivion. She had taken her body's death without too much complaining because, well, she'd still been here. To know that she might have disappeared, have lost the chance to meet the people she was counting on seeing again, shocked her into silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦呆呆地看着天空，想到自己差一点就彻底灰飞烟灭了，还有些后怕。对于自己身体的死亡，她没有过多抱怨，因为毕竟自己还在这里。但得知自己有可能彻底消失，失去与自己盼望重逢的亲人们相见的机会，她被吓得说不出话来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes you would have," it was a whisper but it carried far enough to reach her ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right," she muttered. Without looking at him, she marched forward. Although her limbs ached and she felt exhausted, she did not want to be caught out here in the dark. Tristan watched her walk away. Her head was held high and she walked swiftly, but there was a limp to her gait, and she rubbed her throat absent-mindedly. He knew she must be suffering after yesterday's trauma.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好。”她小声说。她没有看他，径自往前走去。即使四肢疼痛，疲惫不堪，也好过她独自在黑暗中被恶魔逮住。崔斯坦看着她走远。她高昂着头，脚步很快，但步态却一瘸一拐。她漫不经心地揉着自己的嗓子，崔斯坦知道昨天受了一场大罪后，她一定仍在忍受疼痛的折磨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“等一下。”他大声喊着跑向迪伦。她停下脚步，转头等着他。崔斯坦跑到她身边时没有停下脚步，而是向前迈了一步正好站在了她的身前。他微笑着，背对着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢！”迪伦的脸上露出如释重负的喜色。她抓着他的肩膀跳了上去，双腿绕在他的腰间，胳膊搂着他的脖子。他把自己的胳膊勾在她的膝盖下面，开始继续跋涉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你！”她在他耳边低语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took long, powerful strides that gently jostled Dylan with every footfall. Very quickly, she became stiff and uncomfortable on his back. Her arms were pained holding on to his shoulders and his arms under her knees were bruising her. Still, it was much better than walking. She tried to relax her muscles, and concentrated on revelling in being so close to Tristan. His shoulders were broad and strong, and he handled the burden of her extra weight as if she were made of feathers. Her face was tucked into the crook of his neck, and she inhaled deeply, savouring the musky smell of him. His sandy hair bobbed as he walked and tickled her cheek. She fought an urge to run her fingers through it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦迈开大步向前走，每一次脚落地迪伦也会跟着轻轻晃一下。很快，迪伦就感觉自己在他的背上身子僵硬，很不舒服。勾着崔斯坦肩膀的双臂很痛，而崔斯坦放在迪伦膝盖下面的胳膊也磨得她难受。尽管如此，这还是比让她自己走好多了。迪伦尽量让自己的肌肉松弛下来，尽力陶醉在能跟崔斯坦近距离接触的喜悦中。他的肩膀宽阔而结实，他背着迪伦这额外增加的重量毫不吃力，甚至感觉她轻如鸿毛。她的脸伸进他的脖颈处，深呼吸，回味着他身上的麝香味。他金色的头发随着他的脚步上下移动，蹭得她的脸颊痒痒的。她努力克制着把手指伸进他的头发里的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When we get there," he said, startling her, "you'll have to get down and walk yourself."</div>

The ground beyond it looked exactly the same as that before, but strangely distorted, as if there were a transparent screen in front of it. The point on the ground where the screen met the earth did indeed seem to shimmer slightly. Dylan felt her stomach tighten as she stared at it. They were there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在他们前方大概半英里的地方，空气似乎变得不一样了。此处前后的地面看起来别无二致，只不过有些诡异地扭曲了，就好像在它的前方放着一面透明的屏幕一样，屏幕和地面的交会点的确在闪着光。迪伦的目光注视着那里，感觉胃部发紧。要到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦把她的腿放下来，迪伦从他的后背滑到了地面上。小腿和双脚有一种麻刺的感觉。她舒展了一下胳膊，然后挺起胸正视这段旅途的终点。她没有看他，开始向前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

He deliberately kept one step behind her. When she got to within five metres of the line, she halted. She stared at it, breathing evenly. Her face was drawn, her mouth tight. He could read her stress in every muscle in her body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦仔细打量着她。尽管她既没有看自己，也没有和自己说话，但是崔斯坦能感觉到她非常留心自己的一举一动。他特意只在她身后保持一步的距离。当迪伦离交界线还有五米的时候，她停了下来，呼吸均匀，然而面色憔悴，嘴角紧绷。他能看出她身体的每一块肌肉都处于紧张状态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her heart was racing, thudding wildly in her chest. She felt adrenaline course through her veins. Although her arms and legs had been aching, they now felt as if they did not belong to her, and she was not entirely in control of them. Taking deep, even breaths, she tried to concentrate on not hyperventilating. The ground seemed to fly beneath her feet. It was little more than a hundred metres away now. As they got closer, it became easier to see the join between the two worlds. The world beyond the point was just slightly out of focus, like she was looking at it through someone else's glasses. It was beginning to make her slightly dizzy so she tried to look straight at the floor, occasionally glancing up to the shimmering line across the path.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的心在胸膛里狂跳不止。尽管之前她的胳膊和双腿一直都很痛，但现在却感觉它们像是不属于自己似的，并不完全受自己的控制。迪伦做了一次均匀的深呼吸，尽力集中精神，不让自己的呼吸过于急促。地面似乎在她的脚下飞了起来，现在离那个地方差不多只有百米之遥了。他们越靠近，两个世界的交会处就越清晰。交接点之外的世界显得有些模糊不清，像是透过别人的眼睛看到的景象。这让她的头有一点晕，所以她尽量看着地面，偶尔抬起头看看那道横跨小路的闪光界线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the idea terrified her, and she knew by saying it she was making herself more emotionally vulnerable than she had ever been in her life, she was determined. The past few days had taught her a lot about herself; she was not the same girl who had dithered over packing her teddy bear. She was stronger, braver. She'd faced danger; confronted her fears, and Tristan had played a massive part in that. He had protected her, comforted her, guided her, and opened her eyes to feelings she hadn't known existed. It was important to tell him how she felt, even though it made her stomach flutter and her cheeks burn. Just do it, she told herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管这个念头让她自己也感到害怕，尽管她知道说出这番话会让自己的感情变得无比脆弱，但她还是下定了决心。过去几天的经历让她更好地了解了自己。她不再是那个为装不装泰迪熊而犹豫不决的小女孩了。现在的她更加坚定，也更加勇敢。她已经能够正视危险，勇敢地面对自己内心的恐惧感。在这方面崔斯坦发挥了巨大的作用。他保护着她，安慰着她，引领着她，开拓了她的视野，让她体验到了之前一无所知的感情。因此她必须向他坦露自己现在的感受，哪怕这会让她胃部痉挛，哪怕这会让她颈部灼痛。做就是了，她暗自告诉自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyes never left his face, trying to read his reaction. The words seemed to hang in the air between them. Dylan's every nerve was tingling and alert, her hormones thudding through her veins. She hadn't meant to blurt it out like that, but she hadn't known how to broach the subject and she needed to say it. She continued to look at Tristan, waiting for a smile or a frown, for his eyes to shine or freeze, but his face was impassive. Her pulse, instead of racing, was beating in a disjointed pattern that made her fear that it might stop. As the silence lengthened, she began to shake, her body preparing for rejection.</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't feel the same way. Of course he didn't. She was just a child. She had read what she'd wanted to into his words and his touch. Her eyes began to sting as tears fought their way to the surface. She gritted her teeth, determined to keep control. Her fingers curled into fists and squeezed tightly, the nails digging into her palms painfully. It wasn't enough. The pain in her chest was agony, like burning knives piercing her right in the centre. It rode over every other sensation and made it hard to breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的感受和她并不一样。当然了，在他看来她还只是个孩子。她对他的话语和触碰完全会错了意。她的眼睛开始感到一阵刺痛，泪水夺眶而出。她紧咬牙关，努力克制自己。她的手指攥成拳头，紧紧握着，指甲刺进了手掌里。可是光这点痛还不算完，胸口的疼痛才让她苦不堪言，如同一把灼热的匕首刺进了胸膛正中。这种痛盖过了其他感官的不适，让她的呼吸倍感艰难。">查看中文翻译</div>

He saw her eyes widen, and heard her breathing become ragged, and knew that she was taking the worst possible meaning from his silence. She believed he did not love her. He closed his eyes, trying to get some perspective. If she thought he didn't love her, perhaps she wouldn't hurt so much at the end. Perhaps it would be easier. It was right to say nothing.

<div class="line_en">She gazed at him for a moment, frozen in time. Her heart beat triumphantly as she processed his words. He loved her. She exhaled in a half-laugh, and broke into a grin, her eyes dancing. The pain in her chest melted away, replaced by a soft glow that crept up her throat and shone out of her smile. Taking a cautious step forward, she moved to him. She could feel his breath on her face; it, too, was coming in gasps. His eyes burned blue, penetrating into her very core and making her tremble slightly. She leaned up to him, close enough to see each freckle that patterned his nose and cheeks, then stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">With one hand he pulled her in closer to his body, with the other he cupped the back of her neck, sliding his fingers into her hair. Chills erupted over Dylan's skin and her half-hearted protest died in her throat. His thumb stroked up and down the nape of her neck and she watched unblinking as his face dropped lower until his forehead rested against hers. He was close enough for their breath to intermingle, close enough for her to feel the heat of his body. He closed the final distance between them, dropping his grip on her hand and her neck and folding his arms around her back, pulling her nearer still. Tilting her head back a fraction, Dylan closed her eyes and waited.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were soft. That was his first thought. Soft, and sweet, and trembling. He felt her fingers twist into the fabric of his jumper, her hands shaking slightly against his sides. Her lips parted, moving against his. He heard her utter a tiny moan, and the sound sent a ripple into the pit of his stomach. He squeezed her tighter, his mouth pressing harder against hers. His heart was crashing against his ribs, his breathing ragged. The only thing he was aware of was the warmth of her, the softness. He felt her grow bolder, going up on her tiptoes to lean further into him, lifting her hands from his side and gripping his shoulders, his face. He copied the movement, his fingers trailing down her hairline, around her chin. Memorising.</div>

He held her face in his hands and stared at her for a long moment, eyes glowing vivid blue. Then he dropped his head again and placed two soft, gentle kisses on her lips. He smiled at her, a slow languid smile that had the muscles in her abdomen contracting.</div>

Though it tore at his heart, he forced himself to watch every tear, listen to every sob and scream. He longed to rush forwards and comfort her, to embrace her and smooth the tears off her cheeks. To feel the heat of her in his arms again, the softness of her. He lifted one hand and placed in it the air, palm to palm with hers, cold agony -- a wall of glass between them.
