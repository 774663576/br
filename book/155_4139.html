<div class="line_en">My nagging got the better of Jem eventually, as I knew it would, and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while. He still maintained, however, that Atticus hadn't said we couldn't, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldn't, Jem had thought of a way around it: he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldn't be accused of playing anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming something of a trial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him, then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I was the only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did no good, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning, calling me only when they needed a third party. But I kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her front porch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪尔衷心拥护这个行动计射。他变得越来越讨厌了，老跟在杰姆屁股后边转。夏天开始时他曾经提出要和我结婚，说完就忘了。他把我当作他的财产，说他永远只爱我一个人，可叉把我抛下不管。我狠狠打过他两次，没用，他反而跟杰姆跟得更紧了。他们整天呆在树上的小屋里挖空心思，制定计划，只是在需要第三者时才把我叫上去。好一段时间我对他们敬而远之，不参加他们的那些越来越愚蠢的计戈！I。为了免遭太女孩子气的指责，那个夏天剩下的傍晚我干脆和莫迪·阿特金森小姐一起，天天坐在她的前廊上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She loved everything that grew in God's earth, even the weeds. With one exception. If she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne: she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful it'd kill us all if we didn't stand out of the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudie's yard if we kept out of her azaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and Dill excluded me from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood, but a relatively benign presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要我们不动莫迪小姐的杜鹃花，杰姆和我就可以在她的院子里任意玩耍。但是我们和她的接触并没有明确规定下来。在杰姆和迪怨没有把我从他们的计划中排除之前，她不过是邻近的一位小姐，仅仅是比较平易近人罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat her scuppernongs if we didn't jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms so generous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their behavior.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted.

<div class="line_en">Her speech was crisp for a Maycomb County inhabitant. She called us by all our names, and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth. When I admired them and hoped I would have some eventually, she said, "Look here." With a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework, a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在梅科姆镇上，她说话算是干脆的。她直呼我们的名字，笑时嘴里锈出两个夹在上颚犬牙上的金牙。当我表示赞赏并且希望我也能有几颗金牙时她说：“看这里。”她舌头一动，吐出假牙，这个友好的动作加深了我们的友谊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pull it up, child, pull it up?" She picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk. Microscopic grains oozed out. "Why, one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard. Look here. When it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over Maycomb County!" Miss Maudie's face likened such an occurrence unto an Old Testament pestilence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拔出来，孩子，拔出来？”她掐下小草萎软了的嫩芽，用大拇指使劲推挤那小小的茎杆，很小很小的草籽掉了出来。“为什么？一蔸莎草会毁掉整个园子。你看，一到秋天这些东西干了，风一吹就会传遍整个梅科姆县！”从莫迪小姐的面部表情来看，这就象《圣经·旧约》里描写的瘟疫一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Maudie's benevolence extended to Jem and Dill, whenever they paused in their pursuits: we reaped the benefits of a talent Miss Maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us. She made the best cakes in the neighborhood. When she was admitted into our confidence, every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones, and she would call across the street: "Jem Finch, Scout Finch, Charles Baker Harris, come here!" Our promptness was always rewarded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Maudie had known Uncle Jack Finch, Atticus's brother, since they were children. Nearly the same age, they had grown up together at Finch's Landing. Miss Maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner, Dr. Frank Buford. Dr. Buford's profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground, so he stayed poor. Uncle Jack Finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in Nashville and stayed rich. We saw Uncle Jack every Christmas, and every Christmas he yelled across the street for Miss Maudie to come marry him. Miss Maudie would yell back, "Call a little louder, Jack Finch, and they'll hear you at the post office, I haven't heard you yet!" Jem and I thought this a strange way to ask for a lady's hand in marriage, but then Uncle Jack was rather strange. He said he was trying to get Miss Maudie's goat, that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years, that he was the last person in the world Miss Maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing, and the best defense to her was spirited offense, all of which we understood clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫迪小姐从小就认识阿迪克斯的弟弟杰克·芬奇。因为年龄相似，他们在芬奇庄园上一起长大。莫迪小姐是附近一个土地所有者弗兰克·布福德医生的女儿。布福德医生的职业是行医，可他对地里长着的东西入迷，所以一生清贫。杰克·芬奇叔叔的爱好只是在窗槛花箱方面，在纳什维尔一直挺富裕。每逢圣诞节我们便能见到他。每次，他隔着街大喊，要莫迪小姐嫁给他。莫迪小姐也会喊着回答：“再大声一点，杰克·芬奇，让邮局的人也能听见，我还没听到你喊什么呢！”杰姆和我认为这是向女子求婚的一种奇怪方式。杰克叔叔本来就是个古怪的人。他说他只不过想惹她发火罢了。但是他试了四十年都没成功。他还说莫迪小姐最不愿和他这种入结婚，但最愿拿他开心。对奥迪小姐来说，最好的防御办法就是勇猛的攻击。这些我们心里都明白。">查看中文翻译</div>

But while no one with a grain of sense trusted Miss Stephanie, Jem and I had considerable faith in Miss Maudie. She had never told on us, had never played cat-and-mouse with us, she was not at all interested in our private lives. She was our friend.
