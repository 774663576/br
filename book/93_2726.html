<div class="line_en">Dr. Kaye, Marty's neurologist, called it a "freak" accident because the chance of it happening to a 10-year-old girl was almost nil. "The fact is, " Dr. Kaye droned, "spinal cord injuries occur most often among men ages 18--24. Paraplegia is generally the result of motor vehicle accidents. Medical science is still in search of a cure,"she had noted with authority.</div>

<div class="line_en">They said things like, "why not get an electric wheelchair, dear", to which Marty always wantted to say, "what's wrong with wheeling my own chair?"

<div class="line_en">By the next weekend, the girls had finished their script. Dr. Laura had even drawn a diagram of the spinal cord. It showed how messages went from the brain down the nerves along the spinal cord. The messages ended where Marty's spinal cord was broken. That was why when her brain told her legs to move, they couldn't. That message never got to the legs. It got as far as the break in her spine.</div>

<div class="line_en">The video also showed how Marty could get into cars, and into her bed. There was even a part where Marty got on her horse, and took her dog for a walk, and weeded her vegetable garden, and fixed a lamp bracket for the family. The girls decided to leave out the stuff that showed how she went to the bathroom.</div>
