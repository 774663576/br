<div class="line_en">Rain filled the gutters and splashed knee-high off the sidewalk. Big cops in slickers that shone like gun barrels had a lot of fun carrying giggling girls across the bad places. The rain drummed hard on the roof of the car and the burbank top began to leak. A pool of water formed on the floorboards for me to keep my feet in. It was too early in the fall for that kind of rain. I struggled into a trench coat and made a dash for the nearest drugstore and bought myself a pint of whiskey. Back in the car I used enough of it to keep warm and interested. I was long overparked, but the cops were too busy carrying girls and blowing whistles to bother about that.</div>

<div class="line_en">He showed about four o'clock. A cream-colored coupe stopped in front of the store and I caught a glimpse of the fat face and the Charlie Chan moustache as he dodged out of it and into the store. He was hatless and wore a belted green leather raincoat. I couldn't see his glass eye at that distance. A tall and very good-looking kid in a jerkin came out of the store and rode the coupe off around the corner and came back walking, his glistening black hair plastered with rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约四点钟，他出现了。一辆米色小轿车在店门口停下，他闪身下车走进店门时，我瞥见了那张肥脸和那两道陈查理式的八字须。他没戴帽子，穿着有腰带的绿皮雨衣。隔这么远，我看不到他的玻璃眼睛。一个穿无袖紧身外套的高个俊俏小伙子走出店门，把车开到旁边的小路里停好。他步行走回来时，闪亮的黑发沾上了雨珠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another hour went by. It got dark and the rain-clouded lights of the stores were soaked up by the black street. Street-car bells jangled crossly. At around five-fifteen the tall boy in the jerkin came out of Geiger's with an umbrella and went after the cream-colored coupe. When he had it in front Geiger came out and the tall boy held the umbrella over Geiger's bare head. He folded it, shook it off and handed it into the car. He dashed back into the store. I started my motor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时又过去了。雨气氤氲的商铺灯火浸没在漆黑的街道里。有轨电车暴躁地叮当打着铃。五点五十分左右，那穿紧身外套的高个小伙子撑着伞踏出盖革的店门，走到那辆米色轿车后面。他让人把车开到门口，看盖革出来了，小伙子忙在他光秃秃的头顶上方打起伞。他收好伞，甩了甩水，递进车内。他奔回店里。我把车发动了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The coupe went west on the boulevard, which forced me to make a left turn and a lot of enemies, including a motorman who stuck his head out into the rain to bawl me out. I was two blocks behind the coupe before I got in the groove. I hoped Geiger was on his way home. I caught sight of him two or three times and then made him turning north into Laurel Canyon Drive. Halfway up the grade he turned left and took a curving ribbon of wet concrete which was called Laverne Terrace. It was a narrow street with a high bank on one side and a scattering of cabin-like houses built down the slope on the other side, so that their roofs were not very much above road level. Their front windows were masked by hedges and shrubs. Sodden trees dripped all over the landscape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小轿车在大道上往西行驶，害我只好左转，还结了不少仇家，其中有一个电车司机，他冒雨伸出头来痛骂了我一顿。追赶到离它只差两个街区时，我开始进入状态了。我希望盖革是在回家。有两三次我看见了他的车，在他向北转入月桂峡谷大道时我终于追上了。爬了半条坡道他左转了，驶入了一条潮湿的曲线水泥路，名叫拉维恩街。那是条窄路，一边是高高的堤岸，另一边散布着类似棚屋的房子，它们沿下坡而建，所以屋顶并不比路面高出多少。屋子正面的窗户掩映在树障和灌木中。放眼望去，尽是湿漉漉的树在滴水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two cars came up the hill and went over the crest. It seemed to be a very quiet street. At a little after six more bright lights bobbed through the driving rain. It was pitch black by then. A car dragged to a stop in front of Geiger's house. The filaments of its lights glowed dimly and died. The door opened and a woman got out. A small slim woman in a vagabond hat and a transparent raincoat. She went in through the box maze. A bell rang faintly, light through the rain, a closing door, silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两辆车开上山来，朝山顶而去。那条街似乎非常安静。六点稍过，又有几束明亮的灯光扫破暴雨。此时天已漆黑。一辆车在盖革家门前缓缓停下。灯丝逐渐暗了下去，熄灭了。车门打开，下来一个女人。她身材苗条，戴着阔边毡帽，披着透明雨衣。她穿进迷宫似的树障。隐约一声门铃，雨中透出灯光，门慢慢关上，阒无声响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Geiger had his lights on and I hadn't. I speeded up and passed him on a curve, picked a number off a house as I went by and turned at the end of the block. He had already stopped. His car lights were tilted in at the garage of a small house with a square box hedge so arranged that it masked the front door completely. I watched him come out of the garage with his umbrella up and go in through the hedge. He didn't act as if he expected anybody to be tailing him. Light went on in the house. I drifted down to the next house above it, which seemed empty but had no signs out. I parked, aired out the convertible, had a drink from my bottle, and sat. I didn't know what I was waiting for, but something told me to wait. Another army of sluggish minutes dragged by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖革亮起了灯，我却没有。我加快速度，在一个弯超了他的车，经过一座房子时还顺便记下了门牌号，开到这段路的尽头后把车转进了一条小路。他已经停车了。他的灯光从一幢小房子的车库里斜射出来；屋前有片方形的黄杨树障，刻意设计过，把正门完全挡住了。我看他撑着伞走出车库，穿过树障进去了。他好像并不觉得有人在跟踪他。屋里亮起灯。我空挡向北滑行到下一座房子，里面好像没人，但屋外并没有悬着什么牌子。我停下车，打开窗户通通风，举起酒瓶喝了几口，坐着。我不清楚自己在等待什么，但冥冥中知道要等。一分钟一分钟又慢吞吞挨过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At seven-twenty a single flash of hard white light shot out of Geiger's house like a wave of summer lightning. As the darkness folded back on it and ate it up a thin tinkling scream echoed out and lost itself among the rain-drenched trees. I was out of the car and on my way before the echoes died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七点二十分，盖革家射出一道强烈的白光，犹如一阵夏日的闪电。正当黑暗再次将它笼罩将它吞没时，一阵微弱细碎的尖叫从屋内回荡了出来，消失在雨水淋漓的树丛间。我赶紧下车，可走在半路，回声已经退散了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I reached a flash out of my car pocket and went downgrade and looked at the car. It was a Packard convertible, maroon or dark brown. The left window was down. I felt for the license holder and poked light at it. The registration read: Carmen Sternwood, 3765 Alta Brea Crescent, West Hollywood. I went back to my car again and sat and sat. The top dripped on my knees and my stomach burned from the whiskey. No more cars came up the hill. No lights went on in the house before which I was parked. It seemed like a nice neighborhood to have bad habits in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我伸手从车上的置物袋里拿出手电，走下去看了看那辆车。是辆帕卡德敞篷车，不是褐紫色就是深棕色。左边的车窗没摇上。我摸到了驾照夹，用手电一照。车主信息是：卡门·斯特恩伍德，西好莱坞区阿尔塔·布雷亚新月街道3765号。我回到车上，坐了又坐。车顶上的雨滴到我的膝盖上，威士忌在我的胃里灼烧。山上不再有车辆的踪影。我车前的那幢房子没亮灯。要在这一带干点坏事，似乎正合适。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no fear in the scream. It had a sound of half-pleasurable shock, an accent of drunkenness, an overtone of pure idiocy. It was a nasty sound. It made me think of men in white and barred windows and hard narrow cots with leather wrist and ankle straps fastened to them. The Geiger hideaway was perfectly silent again when I hit the gap in the hedge and dodged around the angle that masked the front door. There was an iron ring in a lion's mouth for a knocker. I reached for it, I had hold of it. At that exact instant, as if somebody had been waiting for the cue, three shots boomed in the house. There was a sound that might have been a long harsh sigh. Then a soft messy thump. And then rapid footsteps in the house -- going away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那尖叫声里没有恐惧。有的是惊喜参半的语气，酒醉迷离的腔调，十足弱智的口吻。那声音令人作呕。让我想到栅栏窗户里的病床上那些身穿白衣、手脚绑着皮带的人。等我走进树障的豁口，闪身绕过遮挡前门的部分时，盖革的老窝已经复归寂静。狮口里的铁圈便是门环。我伸手抓了上去。就在这一刻，似乎有人在等信号似的，屋里传出三声枪响。好像有谁粗粝地长叹了一声。接着，忙乱中有什么软软的东西重重摔在了地上。屋里响起急骤的脚步声——有人逃跑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I straddled the fence at the side of the runway and leaned far out to the draped but unscreened French window and tried to look in at the crack where the drapes came together. I saw lamplight on a wall and one end of a bookcase. I got back on the runway and took all of it and some of the hedge and gave the front door the heavy shoulder. This was foolish. About the only part of a California house you can't put your foot through is the front door. All it did was hurt my shoulder and make me mad. I climbed over the railing again and kicked the French window in, used my hat for a glove and pulled out most of the lower small pane of glass. I could now reach in and draw a bolt that fastened the window to the sill. The rest was easy. There was no top bolt. The catch gave. I climbed in and pulled the drapes off my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我骑在车道一边的围栏上，朝挂了帘子却没有装纱幔的落地窗探出身去，透过两块窗帘中间的缺口尽量向内张望。我看到墙上的灯光和书橱的一角。我回到车道上，助跑了整条车道和一段树障，用肩膀狠狠撞上门去。加州的房子，你唯一没法走的大概就是正门。我只落得个肩膀剧痛，急火攻心的下场。我再次爬上栏杆，踹碎落地窗，用帽子裹着手，差不多拔干净了底下的碎玻璃。这下我可以把手伸进去拉开扣住窗户和窗台的插销了。剩下的事很简单。窗户顶上没有插销。锁扣开了。我翻进去，扯掉贴到脸上的帘子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neither of the two people in the room paid any attention to the way I came in, although only one of them was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于我是怎么进来的，屋里的两个人都毫不在意，虽然其中只有一个是死人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door fronted on a narrow run, like a footbridge over a gully, that filled the gap between the house wall and the edge of the bank. There was no porch, no solid ground, no way to get around to the back. The back entrance was at the top of a flight of wooden steps that rose from the alley-like street below. I knew this because I heard a clatter of feet on the steps, going down. Then I heard the sudden roar of a starting car. It faded swiftly into the distance. I thought the sound was echoed by another car, but I wasn't sure. The house in front of me was as silent as a vault. There wasn't any hurry. What was in there was in there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门前的马路很窄，好比架在水沟上的步行桥，为了解决围墙和堤岸边缘之间的缺口。没有走廊，没有空地，也没有路可以绕到屋后。后门开在一段从下方小巷似的街上筑起的木台阶顶上。我知道这一点是因为听见了“哒哒哒”踏下台阶的脚步声。接着突然传来汽车发动的轰鸣声。那声响很快没入了远处。好像又有一辆车发出了声响，但我不能确定。眼前的这座房子如墓穴般死寂。不必着急了。里面的东西跑不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
