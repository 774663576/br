<div class="line_en">Of my country and of my family I have little to say. Ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the other. Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodise the stores which early study very diligently garnered up. Beyond all things, the works of the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities. I have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with a very common error of this age -- I mean the habit of referring occurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the principles of that science. Upon the whole, no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition. I have thought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.</div>

<div class="line_en">After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18—, from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I went as passenger -- having no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在异乡游荡了多年。18XX年，我登上了从巴塔维亚港驶往巽他群岛的航船。巴塔维亚位于物产富饶、人口众多的爪哇岛。我成了这艘船上的一名乘客——没有别的原因，只因为我有如鬼神缠身般心神不定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular, isolated cloud, to the N. W. It was remarkable, as well for its colour, as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia. I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapour, and looking like a long line of low beach. My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the peculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heated iron. As night came on, every breath of wind died away, and a more entire calm it is impossible to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration. However, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon deck. I went below -- not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed, every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck. As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship quivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天傍晚，我斜靠在船尾的栏杆上，望着西北方那朵独特的云孤零零地飘。我们离开巴塔维亚以来，还是第一次看到云彩，加上它的颜色也特别，所以显得引人注目。我凝望着它，直到夕阳西下。那会儿，云朵突然朝东西两方蔓延开去，在天水相连处，形成一道狭窄的烟霞，形状宛如一条长长的浅滩。不久，我的注意力又被暗红色的月亮和罕见的海景所吸引。大海瞬息万变，海水却似乎比平常透明了。尽管我能清晰地看到海底，抛下铅陲一量，方知船下水深居然有15英寻。此时空气变得酷热难耐，热气袅袅上升，犹如从灼热的铁块上升腾而起。夜晚来临了，一丝风都没有，周遭是想像不出的寂静。船尾楼甲板上，烛火连一下子都不跳荡；用手指捏一根长发，它也不可能飘动。然而船长却说看不出有什么危险，我们的船刚漂向海岸，他就下令收起风帆、抛下铁锚。没安排人值班守夜，那些水手大多是马来人，他们都在甲板上肆意地摊开了身子睡下了。我回到船舱——大有不幸将至的预感。说真的，所有的迹象都表明，西蒙风——一种沙漠热风暴即将到来。我把自己的担心告诉了船长。但他对我的话无动于衷，甚至没有屈尊回答我一句，就走开了。我很不安，因此根本不能入眠。大约午夜时分，我爬上了甲板。我刚踏上后甲板扶梯的最上面一级，就吓呆了，一阵巨大的嗡嗡声响起，就像水车轮子飞速转动的声音。我还没弄清楚是怎么回事，就已感觉到船身震动开了。紧接着，一个巨浪朝船梁末端打来，一波接一波地从船头扫向船尾，掠过了整个甲板。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was at first struck with the idea of our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were ingulfed. After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft. We soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. All on deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard; the captain and mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged with water. Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course, parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us. The frame-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received considerable injury; but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast. The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that in our shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue. But this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified. For five entire days and nights -- during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle -- the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I had before encountered. Our course for the first four days was, with trifling variations, S. E. and by S.; and we must have run down the coast of New Holland. On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northward. The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a very few degrees above the horizon -- emitting no decisive light. There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun. It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim, sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到底是怎样的奇迹使我幸免于难，真是说不清。我被那个巨浪打晕了，醒来时，我发现自己卡在船尾柱和方向舵之间了。我费了很大的劲儿才站起来。我头晕眼花地朝四下里张望着，顿时明白船只遇到了滚滚浪涛，想不到的是，它还被卷入了一个排山倒海的漩涡——那漩涡真可怕，把我们都吞噬掉了。过了一会儿，我听到了一个瑞典老头的声音。他是在船只将要离港时上来的。我拼尽全力朝他高呼，他马上蹒跚着来到船尾。我们很快发现，我们俩是这次事故仅有的幸存者。除了我和他，甲板上所有的人都被扫落海中。船长和他的副手们，肯定在睡梦中死去了，因为船舱里都灌满了水。没有人援助。我们根本不能使船只摆脱险境。由于心里想着船随时都可能下沉，我们起先并没采取任何措施。当然，我们的锚索早在第一阵飓风的淫威下，像包裹上的细线一样断为一截一截了，否则船当即就给掀翻了。船以可怕的速度随波而行。水流哗哗地拍打着船板。船尾的骨架已支离破碎。实际上，它早已千疮百孔。让我们狂喜的是，水泵倒没有坏掉，压舱物也没有太大的移动。风暴最狂怒的时刻已经过去，我们几乎感觉不到风的危险了，但我们还是心情郁闷，盼望着它能彻底平息。船已破烂不堪，我们完全相信，继之而起的巨浪肯定会置我们于死地。不过，如此合理的推断似乎不会马上兑现。因为整整五天五夜，这条废船都是在狂风的推动下，以难以估量的速度，飞速漂行。狂风虽然不及第一阵热风暴猛烈了，却仍然比我以前见过的任何一次都可怕。五天五夜，我们仅凭少量的椰子糖生存，那是我们历尽艰辛从前甲板下面的水手舱里弄到的。当然，前四天，我们的航向基本没变，只在东南和正南方游移。我们准是在沿着新荷兰海岸漂游。到了第五天，风向逐渐转变，更加偏向北方，可是也冷地更厉害了。太阳从地平线稍稍升起，呈现出病歪歪的昏黄色——并没有光芒放射出来。天上没有云彩，可是风却变化无常，一阵一阵地越刮越猛。大约在中午的时候——这时间只是我们的猜测，太阳再次抓住了我们的注意力。它放出的不是通常意义上的光，而是一种朦胧昏沉的光晕，可是没有辐射热，仿佛所有的光线都溶化掉了。在沉入喧嚣的大海之前，那团光晕的中间部位突然消失了，似乎是被无从解释的力量匆匆熄灭，只剩下一个边框——一个银色的边框，一头扎进深不可测的大海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation of the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally righted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从很大程度上说，正是那排来势汹汹的巨浪，拯救了我们的船只。虽然整条船都灌进了水，不过由于桅杆已被巨浪折断，坠入海中，船不久就吃力地浮出海面，在暴风雨中摇晃了一阵子后，最终恢复平稳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day -- that day to me has not arrived -- to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward we were enshrouded in pitchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto attended us. All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony. Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We were, however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice. In the meantime every moment threatened to be our last -- every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. The swell surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling. At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross -- at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们等待着第六天的到来，却只是徒劳——对我而言，那一天还没有到来；对瑞典老头而言，第六天压根就没有到来。我们后来一直陷入沉沉黑暗，看不到离船二十步开外的任何东西。黑夜密密实实地包围着我们，没有尽头，我们熟悉的热带磷火也不曾把海面照亮。我们还发现，尽管暴风继续势头不减地肆虐，但一直侵袭我们的狂涛巨浪却不见了。周围是黑暗的荒漠，恐怖而阴森。因为迷信生发的恐惧悄然潜入瑞典老头的心魂。我的心里也暗自诧异。我们不再关心这条几乎报废了的船，而是尽可能地抱紧残余的后桅杆自救，一边痛苦地望着茫茫的大海。我们无法计算时间，也猜测不出自己的处境，但我们非常清楚，我们已经向南漂了太远，漂到了任何航海家都未曾到过的地方。不过，令我们感到惊奇的是，我们并没有撞上很常见的冰山。现在，我们随时面临着威胁，每一个山峰一样的浪头都可能把我们吞没，每时每刻都可能是生命的尽头。海浪汹涌起伏，超乎我一切可能的想像。我们没有立刻葬身海底，真是奇迹。伙伴说船上的货物很轻，他还提醒我说这船质量上乘。但我却止不住自己的感觉。我觉得希望已彻底泯灭，死亡不久就要降临。我已经心灰意冷，做好了去死的准备，因为船每飘行一海里，黑漆漆的大海就翻腾得更骇人几分，更阴沉几分。有时，我们被抛向高高的浪尖，比信天翁飞得还高，气都透不过来；有时，我们又晕头转向地被急流甩下地狱般的深水处。那里空气凝滞，没有一丝声音惊扰海妖的酣梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night. "See! see!" cried he, shrieking in my ears, "Almighty God! see! see!" As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck. Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood. At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship, of perhaps four thousand tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size still exceeded that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging. But what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane. When we first discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her. For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and -- came down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们掉下深渊的那一刻，瑞典老头的惊呼打破了夜的静寂。“看！看！”他喊道，尖叫声直灌耳膜，“全能的上帝啊！看！看！”在他惊呼之际，我已看到，沿着我们坠入的那个巨大的深坑边缘，洒落下来一线朦胧阴沉的红光，并时断时续地反射到甲板上。我抬起眼睛一看，一个奇观赫然在望。我的血液凝固了。在我们的正上方不远处，在一个下劈浪头的陡峭边缘，有个大约有四千吨位的巨轮正在打转。它昂然屹立在一个比船身高出一百多倍的浪尖上，看上去比任何一艘战舰或现有的东印度公司的大商船都大得多。船体是暗沉沉的黑色，即便雕刻上任何常见的图案，也不能减轻它的黑暗色调。从敞开的炮门探出一排黄铜大炮，金光闪闪的表面，泼洒着战灯的亮光。灯绳下的战灯东摇西摆。那艘船在超自然的巨浪和难以驾御的飓风中，照旧张开风帆，驶向下风处。真是让人惊恐万状，我们刚发现它时，只看到了船头，因为浪头正把它从阴森可怖的漩涡里慢慢举起。更可怕的是，它还在令人眩晕的浪尖停留了一会儿，仿佛沉浸在高高在上的庄严之中，然后，晃荡着跌落下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew. With little difficulty I made my way, unperceived, to the main hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I did by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跌落下来时，大船已转向上风，离开那个深渊。一派混乱中，水手们没发现我。我没费什么事，就神不知鬼不觉地溜到了中部舱口。舱口半开半闭着，我马上趁机躲了进去。我不知道自己为什么要这样。我躲起来的主要原因，也许是第一眼看到这艘船上的水手时，心中生出了难言的敬畏。我不愿意轻信这伙人，因为一瞥之下，他们就让我隐约感到新奇、怀疑和忧惧。因此，我想还是在这个船舱里找个藏身之地比较好。我挪开了一小块活动甲板，就这样，在庞大的船骨间，给自己找了个随时藏身的所在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it. A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance. There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself, in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood and the solemn dignity of a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus. Incomprehensible men! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the people will not see. It was but just now that I passed directly before the eyes of the mate; it was no long while ago that I ventured into the captain's own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have written. I shall from time to time continue this journal. It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will not fall to make the endeavour. At the last moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在这艘可怕的船上呆很久了，我想，我的命运指向已经有了眉目。他们真是不可理喻的人！走过我身边时都沉浸在某种思虑中，谁都没有注意我。猜不出他们想的什么。我这么躲藏起来，真是愚蠢，因为他们看不见。刚才我还在大副眼皮子底下穿过呢；不久前我还闯进船长室里，拿了笔墨纸张记录所见所感，而且我已经写下来了。我要把航海日记一直记下去。是的，我也许找不到机会把它公诸于世，但我会尽力想办法。到最后关头，我会把手稿密封在瓶子里，投入大海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation. Are such things the operation of ungoverned chance? I had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails, in the bottom of the yawl. While musing upon the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel. The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又有了新事情出现，给了我新的想像空间。难道天意如此？我早先壮起胆子走上甲板，神不知鬼不觉地，在快艇底部那堆绳梯和旧帆布间躺下，陷入对自己奇特命运的沉思。无意中摸起柏油刷，在身边大桶上那折叠得整整齐齐的辅助帆的边上涂抹起来。现在，那辅助帆就在船上张开着，那把刷子无意间涂出了“发现”这个词。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a material to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied. I mean its extreme porousness, considered independently of the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age. It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood would have every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直在看船骨。它用的木材我从未见过。这种木材的特征，让人不由想到，它并不适宜造船。它质地极其松软，撇开虫蛀不谈，因为在这些海洋航行，势必遭到虫蛀，也不提随着能久月深，木头会腐烂，或许说这个会显得吹毛求疵。我想说的是，如果西班牙像木使用什么不自然的方法膨胀起来的话，这种船木就具备了它的一切特征。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel. Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind. What she is not, I can easily perceive; what she is, I fear it is impossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最近，我对大船的构造进行了一番仔细的观察。尽管武装齐全，但我想它并不是一艘战舰。船上的索具、构造和大体配置，都能推翻这一假设。一看就知道，它不是战舰，可它到底是什么船，我怕就难说清了。我仔细打量着它奇怪的造型、特异的桅杆、硕大的个头、大得离谱的帆、朴实无华的船头、古色古香的船尾，心头偶然有电光石火的念头闪现，而且似曾相识，夹杂着对往事模模糊糊的回忆，不知怎么的，记忆里的一些外国史略和年代久远的事，迢迢而至……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age. Their knees trembled with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind; their voices were low, tremulous, and broken; their eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their grey hairs streamed terribly in the tempest. Around them, on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约在一个钟头前，我斗胆挤进了一群船员当中。他们对我毫不理睬，虽然我就站在他们正中间，但他们却似乎完全意识不到我的存在。就像我当初在船舱里看到的人一样，他们一个个都头发灰白，老态龙钟。他们衰弱得膝盖颤抖，老朽到弓腰曲背；他们枯皱的皮肤在风中簌簌作响；他们的声音很低，还颤抖不已，断断续续，因为上了年纪，眼睛里泪花闪闪，灰白的头发在暴风中猎猎飘扬，煞是可怕。在他们周围的甲板上，到处散落着稀奇古怪、式样过时的制图仪器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In reading the above sentence, a curious apothegm of an old weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection. "It is as sure," he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, "as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我正读着上面的句子，突然想起了一个久经风霜的荷兰老航海家的奇怪箴言。每当有人怀疑他不诚实，拿他取乐时，他常说的话就是：“千真万确，船在海水里会像水手的身体一样，越泡越大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I mentioned, some time ago, the bending of a studding-sail. From that period, the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her terrific course due south, with every rag of canvass packed upon her, from her trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of man to imagine. I have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and for ever. We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple threats, and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effect. I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or impetuous under-tow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不久前提到辅助帆张开了。从那时起，大船就一直顺风飞驶，向南方继续着它可怕的行程。从桅杆顶端的木冠到帆的下桁，都绷得紧紧的，整张帆无不处不饱满。每时每刻，桁端都会卷进滔天的海水中，而海水真是骇人极了。我刚刚离开甲板，虽然船员们依然我行我素，没看出丝毫不便，我却在上面站不稳脚步了。这艘巨轮没有倾覆海底，真是天下第一大奇迹。我们注定不会葬身深渊，而是要继续在死亡的边缘徘徊。我们的船在我从未见过的惊涛骇浪中滑行，就像海鸥那样，箭一般轻巧地掠过。滔天巨浪就像莫测的水妖，头颅高昂，但却不过是吓唬吓唬人，并不会真的摧毁一切。我不由把能一次次逃脱灾难归因为自然因素，只有这样才能解释所发生的事——应该假定船受到的何等强大的水流或海底逆流。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin -- but, as I expected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is, to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man, still, a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded him. In stature, he is nearly my own height; that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of a well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkable otherwise. But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face -- it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age, so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense -- a sentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years. His grey hairs are records of the past, and his greyer eyes are sybils of the future. The cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts. His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery, unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore the signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself -- as did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold -- some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue; and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我终于和船长面对面了，是在船长室里，不过不出所料，他没理睬我。偶然一见，不会觉得他的外表与常人有什么差别，可我看着他，他却仍然有种不可抑制的敬畏感，同时也混杂着惊奇。他身高和我差不多，也就是五点八英尺。他体格结实紧凑，不粗壮，也不纤细。他脸上的表情很奇异——老年的痕迹是那么强烈、触目惊心、令人毛骨悚然，老得不留余地，老得无以复加。一种说不出的情感在我的心头油然泛起。虽然他前额上皱纹很少，但却像是刻上了千年万年的印记——灰白的头发记录过去，浑浊的眼睛预示未来。舱房的地板上，摊满厚厚一层奇怪的铁扣对开本书籍、铸模科学仪器以及遗忘很久的过时航海图。船长双手捧着低垂的头颅，凝视着一张纸，眼神炽热，还流露出不安，那张纸在我看来是份军职委任状，无论怎么说，上有君主签名啊。就像我在船舱里见到的头一个船员一样，他也是一个人嘀嘀咕咕的，他怒冲冲地低声说出几句外国话，尽管他就在我的身畔，可是声音却像从一英里开外的地方传来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers (figures) fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I look around me, I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which, the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? All in the immediate vicinity of the ship, is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe.</div>

<div class="line_en">To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death.

<div class="line_en">In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd of canvass, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea! Oh, horror upon horror! -- the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance. But little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny! The circles rapidly grow small -- we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool -- and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering -- oh God! and -- going down!</div>
