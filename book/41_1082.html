<div class="line_en">Adel looked up. It was the teacher Malalai who had leaned in and whispered this in his ear. A plump, middle-aged woman wearing a violet beaded shawl around her shoulders, she smiled at him now with her eyes shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿德尔抬起头。原来是马拉拉伊老师弯下腰，在他耳边小声说了这么一句。她是个圆滚滚的中年妇人，肩膀上围着一条紫色披巾，上面缀了好多小珠子。她笑眯眯地看着他，眼睛都睁不开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Afghanistan is mother to us all," Adel's father said, one thick index finger raised skyward. The sun caught the band of his agatering. "But she is an ailing mother, and she has suffered for a long time. Now, it is true a mother needs her sons in order to recover. Yes, but she needs her daughters too -- as much, if not more!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿富汗是咱们所有人的母亲。”阿德尔的父亲说着，朝天竖起了粗大的食指，玛瑙戒指在阳光下闪闪发光。“但是，咱们的母亲生了病，病了很长时间。这个时候，母亲需要儿子们帮她好起来，这毫无疑问，可母亲也需要女儿们，同样需要，也许更需要！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were standing on the front steps of the town's new school for girls, a rectangular light green building with a flat roof and wide windows, as Adel's father, his Baba jan, delivered a brief prayer followed by an animated speech. Gathered before them in the blazing midday heat was a large crowd of squinting children, parents, and elders, roughly a hundred or so locals from the small town of Shadbagh-e-Nau, "New Shadbagh."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站在本镇新建女校的正门台阶上。这是一幢四四方方的淡绿色楼房，平平的楼顶，宽大的窗户。阿德尔的父亲，他的巴巴江，做了简短的祷告，随后发表了热情洋溢的讲话。群众聚集在他们面前，有孩子，也有家长和老人，大约一百来号，在正午灼人的热浪包围下，眯缝着眼睛。他们都是当地人，家住小镇沙德巴盖瑙，也就是“新沙德巴格”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His father continued. And Adel's eyes connected with Kabir, one of Baba jan's two bodyguards standing impassively on the other side of Baba jan, Kalashnikov in hand. Adel could see the crowd reflected in Kabir's dark-lensed aviator glasses. Kabir was short, thin, almost frail, and wore suits with flashy colors -- lavender, turquoise, orange -- but Baba jan said he was a hawk and that underestimating him was a mistake you made at your own peril.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲继续讲话。阿德尔和卡比尔交换了一下眼神。卡比尔是巴巴江两个保镖中的一个，此时手拿卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪，面无表情地站在巴巴江的另一侧。他戴着一副飞行眼镜，阿德尔可以从黑色镜片上看到人群的影子。卡比尔又矮又瘦，简直弱不禁风，一身西装颜色俗艳，淡紫，青绿，橙黄，可巴巴江说他是老鹰，谁要是小看他，可就犯了大错，等于自寻死路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So I say this to you, young daughters of Afghanistan," Baba jan concluded, his long, thick arms outstretched in an open gesture of welcome. "You have a solemn duty now. To learn, to apply yourselves, to excel at your studies, to make proud not only your own fathers and mothers but the mother who is common to us all. Her future is in your hands, not mine. I ask that you not think of this school as a gift from me to you. It is merely a building that houses the true gift inside, and that is you. You are the gift, young sisters, not only to me and to the community of Shadbagh-e-Nau but, most importantly, to Afghanistan herself! God bless you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以我要对你们讲，阿富汗年轻的女儿们。”巴巴江开始总结，他伸出两条又粗又长的胳膊，做出了欢迎的手势。“你们现在肩负着庄严的使命，要好好学习，专心致志，学有所成，不仅要让你们自己的父亲和母亲为你们骄傲，也要让咱们所有人共同的母亲感到自豪。她的未来在你们手里，而不在我手里。我请求你们，不要把这座学校当成我送给你们的礼物。这只不过是一座楼，楼里装着的才是真正的礼物，那就是你们。你们才是礼物，年轻的姐妹们，你们不仅是给我的礼物，不仅是给沙德巴盖瑙全体人民的礼物，最重要的是，你们是给阿富汗母亲的礼物！真主保佑你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This drew loud applause and several calls and hoots of approval. Adel scanned the faces in the crowd. They were rapt as they looked up at his father. Baba jan, with his black bushy eyebrows and full beard, standing tall and strong and wide above them, his shoulders nearly broad enough to fill the entryway to the school behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番话引发了热烈的掌声，还有几嗓子喝彩。阿德尔扫视了一下听众的面孔。他们心醉神迷地仰望着他父亲。巴巴江站在他们面前，高大，强壮，魁伟，两道黑黑的浓眉，满脸的大胡子，肩膀几乎和身后的楼门一样宽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The teacher Malalai handed Baba jan a pair of scissors. A red ribbon had been tied across the entryway to the classroom. The crowd inched closer to get a better view, and Kabir motioned a few people back, shoved a couple of them in the chest. Hands rose from the crowd, holding cell phones to video the ribbon cutting. Baba jan took the scissors, paused, turned to Adel and said, "Here, son, you do the honors." He handed the scissors to Adel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马拉拉伊老师递给巴巴江一把剪刀。通往教室的楼门两边绑起了一块红布。群众想看得更清楚，越挤越近，卡比尔朝几个人示意，让他们后退，还推搡着其中两人的胸口。很多人高举手臂，拿着手机，给剪彩录像。巴巴江接过剪刀，迟疑了一下，然后转向阿德尔：“来，儿子，你来代劳。”他把剪刀递到阿德尔面前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba jan then stood at the doorway as the students made a queue and entered the classroom one by one. They were young girls, aged between eight and fifteen, all of them wearing white scarves and the pin-striped uniforms of black and gray that Baba jan had given them. Adel watched as each student shyly introduced herself to Baba jan on her way in. Baba jan smiled warmly, patted their heads, and offered an encouraging word or two. "I wish you success, Bibi Mariam. Study hard, Bibi Homaira. Make us proud, Bibi Ilham."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴巴江此后站到门口，学生们排好队，一个接一个地走进教室。她们都是小姑娘，年龄在八到十五岁之间，包着白头巾，穿黑灰相间的条纹校服，这是巴巴江送给她们的。阿德尔看到，每个学生进来的时候，都会腼腆地向巴巴江报上自己的名字。巴巴江亲切地微笑着，轻轻拍拍她们的头，说上一两句鼓励的话。“祝你成功，玛丽亚姆小姐。好好学习，霍梅拉小姐。给我们长脸，伊尔哈姆小姐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Adel had never heard anyone outside immediate family address Baba jan by anything other than "Commander Sahib," even though the Russians were long gone now and Baba jan hadn't fired a gun in a decade or more. Back at the house, there were framed pictures of Baba jan's jihadi days all around the living room. Adel had committed to memory each of the pictures: his father leaning against the fender of a dusty old jeep, squatting on the turret of a charred tank, posing proudly with his men, ammunition belt strapped across his chest, beside a helicopter they had shot down. Here was one where he was wearing a vest and a bandolier, brow pressed to the desert floor in prayer. He was much skinnier in those days, Adel's father, and always in these pictures there was nothing behind him but mountains and sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿德尔从来没听到过直系亲属以外的任何人，用任何不是“司令官”的字眼称呼过巴巴江，哪怕现在俄国人已经走了很长时间，哪怕巴巴江已经有十年，甚至更长的年头，一枪都没开过。在家里，客厅的墙上挂满了巴巴江参加“圣战”时期的照片，每一张阿德尔都牢记在心：一辆满是灰尘的老吉普，父亲倚靠着挡泥板；一辆烧焦的坦克，他蹲在炮塔上；他们击落的一架直升机，旁边是他和手下人摆着姿势，意气风发，子弹链横捆在他胸前。还有一张是他穿着马甲，背着子弹袋，跪在沙漠里，脑门触地，正在做礼拜。阿德尔的父亲那时比现在要瘦得多，而且在这些照片上，他身后总是荒凉一片，只有沙漠和群山。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, by the black Land Cruiser, Adel stood by his father, sweating now in the heat, and watched him shake hands with the locals. Baba jan fingered a prayer bead in his free hand and listened patiently, leaning in a bit, his brow furrowed, nodding, attentive to each person as he or she came to say thanks, offer prayers, pay respects, many of them taking the opportunity to ask for a favor. A mother whose sick child needed to see a surgeon in Kabul, a man in need of a loan to start a shoe-repair shop, a mechanic asking for a new set of tools.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来在那辆黑色的丰田陆地巡洋舰边上，阿德尔站在父亲身旁，热得直冒汗，看着他和当地人握手。巴巴江用空出来的那只手捻着念珠，身体微微前倾，皱着眉，点着头，对每个人都很专注，耐心地听着男男女女向他道谢，祝福，表达尊敬，很多人借这个机会求他帮忙。有位母亲，孩子病了，需要去喀布尔看医生；有个男人想借钱，开个修鞋铺；还有个机修工想要一套新工具。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Looking at the pictures, Adel wished he had been around to fight jihad alongside his father in those more adventurous days. He liked to picture himself and Baba jan shooting at Russian helicopters together, blowing up tanks, dodging gunfire, living in mountains and sleeping in caves. Father and son, war heroes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看照片的时候，阿德尔真希望自己也打过圣战，在那些比现在还要危险的日子里，和父亲并肩战斗。他喜欢想像自己和巴巴江一起，朝俄国人的直升机射击，炸掉坦克，躲避炮火，住在山上，睡在洞里。父子英雄，战地佳话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baba jan had been shot twice by the Russians during battle. He had shown Adel his wounds, one just under the left rib cage -- he said that one had cost him his spleen -- and one about a thumb's length away from his belly button. He said he was lucky, everything considered. He had friends who had lost arms, legs, eyes; friends whose faces had burned. They had done it for their country, Baba jan said, and they had done it for God. This was what jihad was all about, he said. Sacrifice. You sacrificed your limbs, your sight -- your life, even -- and you did it gladly. Jihad also earned you certain rights and privileges, he said, because God sees to it that those who sacrifice the most justly reap the rewards as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打仗的时候，巴巴江两次吃了俄国人的子弹。他给阿德尔看过伤疤，一处位于胸腔的左下方，他说这一枪打烂了脾脏，另一处离肚脐眼只有一个大拇指的距离。他说不管怎么看，自己都很走运。有的战友失去了胳膊，腿，眼睛，还有战友烧伤了脸。他们这样做是为自己的国家，巴巴江说，他们这样做也是为了真主。他说，这就是圣战的意义。牺牲。你牺牲掉你的手脚，你的视力，甚至你的生命，可你牺牲也欢喜。他说，圣战也可以给你带来某些权利，让你获得特权，因为真主一定会让那些做出牺牲的人得到最公正的回报。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both in this life and the next, Baba jan said, pointing his thick finger first down, then up.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was also a large framed photo of Baba jan smiling alongside President Karzai at Arg, the Presidential Palace in Kabul. This one was more recent, taken in the course of a small ceremony during which Baba jan had been handed an award for his humanitarian work in Shadbagh-e-Nau. It was an award that Baba jan had more than earned. The new school for girls was merely his latest project. Adel knew that women in town used to die regularly giving birth. But they didn't anymore because his father had opened a large clinic, run by two doctors and three midwives whose salaries he paid for out of his own pocket. All the townspeople received free care at the clinic; no child in Shadbagh-e-Nau went unimmunized. Baba jan had dispatched teams to locate water points all over town and dig wells. It was Baba jan who had helped finally bring full-time electricity to Shadbagh-e-Nau. At least a dozen businesses had opened thanks to his loans that, Adel had learned from Kabir, were rarely, if ever, paid back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一张装裱过的大照片，巴巴江微笑着，和卡尔扎伊总统肩并着肩，拍摄地点是阿尔格堡，喀布尔的总统府。这张照片是最近在一个小型颁奖仪式上拍的，巴巴江因为在沙德巴盖瑙的人道主义工作获得了表彰，他完全配得上这个奖。新女校只是他最近一个项目。阿德尔知道，过去镇上经常有女人在生孩子的时候死掉。但在现在不会了，因为他父亲开了一家很大的诊所，有两个医生和三个助产士，他们的薪水由父亲自掏腰包。在诊所里，镇上所有人都可以得到免费治疗；沙德巴盖瑙的所有孩子都接种了疫苗。巴巴江派了工程队，确定了全镇的取水点，打了井。也是在巴巴江的帮助下，沙德巴盖瑙接通了全天候的电力。至少有十几家生意是靠他的借款做起来的，阿德尔从卡比尔那儿了解到，这些钱如果不是全部有去无回的话，也绝大多数都没有归还。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside, as his tinted window rolled up, Adel watched Kabir say something to the old man that Adel couldn't hear. Then Kabir made his way around the front of the SUV and let himself into the driver's seat, laying his Kalashnikov on the passenger seat before turning the ignition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿德尔坐在车里，茶色玻璃窗升上来的时候，他看见卡比尔对老汉说了句什么。阿德尔听不见。随后，卡比尔从SUV前面绕过来，坐进司机位置，将冲锋枪放到副座上，发动了汽车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as the rounds of handshaking were coming to an end, Adel spotted a slight man approaching his father. He wore round, thin-framed spectacles and a short gray beard and had little teeth like the heads of burnt matches. Trailing him was a boy roughly Adel's own age. The boy's big toes poked through matching holes in his sneakers. His hair sat on his head as a matted, unmoving mess. His jeans were stiff with dirt, and they were too short besides. By contrast, his T-shirt hung almost to his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在一轮又一轮的握手即将结束的时候，阿德尔发现有个瘦小的男人正在向他父亲靠近。他戴着一副圆圆的窄框眼镜，留着短短的花白胡子，牙也小小的，像烧过的火柴头。他身后跟着个男孩，岁数和阿德尔差不多，穿着一双破了洞的运动鞋，两个大脚趾头顶在外面。头发趴在他脑门上，像一丛茂密的、纹丝不动的乱草。他的牛仔裤上沾满了泥土，而且太短了，短袖衫却正好相反，几乎耷拉到了膝盖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned onto the road. Some of the boys who had stood in the crowd gave chase for a short while before the Land Cruiser pulled away. Kabir drove through the main crowded strip that bisected the town of Shadbagh-e-Nau, honking frequently as he needled the car through traffic. Everyone yielded. Some people waved. Adel watched the crowded sidewalks on either side of him, his gaze settling on and then off familiar sights -- the carcasses hanging from hooks in butcher shops; the blacksmiths working their wooden wheels, hand-pumping their bellows; the fruit merchants fanning flies off their grapes and cherries; the sidewalk barber on the wicker chair stropping his razor. They passed tea shops, kabob houses, an auto-repair shop, a mosque, before Kabir veered the car through the town's big public square, at the center of which stood a blue fountain and a nine-foot-tall black stone mujahid, looking east, turban gracefully wrapped atop his head, an RPG launcher on his shoulder. Baba jan had personally commissioned a sculptor from Kabul to build the statue.</div>

<div class="line_en">From there, the main road ran north for two miles before it connected with Shadbagh-e-Kohna, Old Shadbagh. Adel had never seen the village as it had once looked decades ago. By the time Baba jan had moved him and his mother from Kabul to Shadbagh, the village had all but vanished. All the homes were gone. The only surviving relic of the past was a decaying windmill. At Shadbagh-e-Kohna, Kabir veered left from the main road onto a wide, quarter-mile-long unpaved track that connected the main road to the thick twelve-foot-high walls of the compound where Adel lived with his parents -- the only standing structure now in Shadbagh-e-Kohna, discounting the windmill. Adel could see the white walls now as the SUV jostled and bounced on the track. Coils of barbed wire ran along the top of the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由此出发，沿公路北行，三公里开外，便是沙德巴盖库赫纳，旧沙德巴格。阿德尔从未见过老村几十年前的面貌。巴巴江让他和他母亲从喀布尔搬到沙德巴格时，村庄几乎已经完全毁弃。所有人家都没了。往日的遗迹只剩下一座风蚀的磨坊。到了沙德巴盖库赫纳，卡比尔左转，下了公路，拐上一条没有铺过的宽阔岔道，它大约四百米长，从公路通往阿德尔和父母住的大院，院外建有厚厚的围墙，高达三米七。如果不算老磨坊，那么这就是现在沙德巴盖库赫纳惟一没有倒掉的建筑了。此时，SUV在小路上跋涉着，颠簸着，阿德尔可以看到白色的围墙，墙头拉着一圈圈的铁丝网。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">North of the strip were a few blocks of residential area, mostly composed of narrow, unpaved streets and small, flat-roofed little houses painted white or yellow or blue. Satellite dishes sat on the roofs of a few; Afghan flags draped a number of windows. Baba jan had told Adel that most of the homes and businesses in Shadbagh-e-Nau had been built in the last fifteen years or so. He'd had a hand in the construction of many of them. Most people who lived here considered him the founder of Shadbagh-e-Nau, and Adel knew that the town elders had offered to name the town after Baba jan but he had declined the honor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公路北面有几片住宅区，大部分都只有狭窄的街道，路面未曾铺过，平顶小屋刷成了或白，或黄，或蓝的颜色。有几户人家的房顶上立着卫星天线，许多窗口松松垮垮地挂出了阿富汗国旗。巴巴江告诉过阿德尔，沙德巴盖瑙的大部分房屋和商户，都是最近十五年里盖起来的。他对许多建筑伸出过援手。这里的大多数居民都把他看成沙德巴盖瑙的建立者。阿德尔还知道，镇里的长者们曾经提议，用巴巴江的名字为本镇命名，但他拒绝了这份荣誉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house stood three stories high and was painted bright pink and turquoise green. It had soaring columns and pointed eaves and mirrored skyscraper glass that sparkled in the sun. It had parapets, a veranda with sparkly mosaics, and wide balconies with curved wrought-iron railings. Inside, they had nine bedrooms and seven bathrooms, and sometimes when Adel and Baba jan played hide-and-seek, Adel wandered around for an hour or more before he found his father. All the counters in the bathrooms and kitchen had been made of granite and lime marble. Lately, to Adel's delight, Baba jan had been talking about building a swimming pool in the basement.</div>

He owned a collection that he had bought on the black market and watched ten to twelve movies a week -- Iranian, French, American, of course Bollywood -- he didn't care.

Adel had another, older mother too, and three older half brothers, but Baba jan had put them up in the east, in Jalalabad, and Adel saw them only once a month or so when Baba jan took him there to visit. Unlike his mother and stepmother, who disliked each other, Adel and his half brothers got along fine. When he visited them in Jalalabad, they took him with them to parks, to bazaars, the cinema, and Buzkashi tournaments.

<div class="line_en">The truth was, the boredom here in Shadbagh was crushing Adel. He hadn't made a single friend in the two years they had lived here. He could not bike into town, certainly not on his own, not with the rash of kidnappings everywhere in the region -- though he did sneak out now and then briefly, always staying within the perimeter of the compound. He had no classmates because Baba jan wouldn't let him attend the local school -- for "security reasons," he said -- so a tutor came to the house every morning for lessons. Mostly, Adel passed the time reading or kicking the soccer ball around on his own or watching movies with Kabir, often the same ones over and over. He wandered listlessly around the wide, high-ceilinged hallways of their massive home, through all the big empty rooms, or else he sat looking out the window of his bedroom upstairs. He lived in a mansion, but in a shrunken world. Some days he was so bored, he wanted to chew wood.</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew that his mother too was terribly lonely here. She tried to fill her days with routines, exercise in the morning, shower, then breakfast, then reading, gardening, then Indian soaps on TV in the afternoon. When Baba jan was away, which was often, she always wore gray sweats and sneakers around the house, her face unmade, her hair pinned in a bun at the back of her neck. She rarely even opened the jewelry box where she kept all the rings and necklaces and earrings that Baba jan brought her from Dubai. She spent hours sometimes talking to her family down in Kabul. Only when her sister and parents visited for a few days, once every two or three months, did Adel see his mother come alive. She wore a long print dress and high-heeled shoes; she put on her makeup. Her eyes shone, and her laughter could be heard around the house. And it was then that Adel would catch a glimpse of the person that perhaps she had been before.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Baba jan was away, Adel and his mother tried to be each other's reprieve. They pushed pieces of jigsaw puzzles around and played golf and tennis on Adel's Wii. But Adel's favorite pastime with his mother was building toothpick houses. His mother would draw a 3-D blueprint of the house on a sheet of paper, complete with front porch, gabled roof, and with staircases inside and walls separating the different rooms.

<div class="line_en">Adel walked on the gravel path toward the main entrance to the compound. The stall where the armed guard stood watch was empty. Adel knew the timing of the guard's rounds.

<div class="line_en">He walked in the wide shadow of the wall toward the back of the compound, away from the main road. Back there, behind the compound, were Baba jan's orchards, of which he was very proud. Several acres of long parallel rows of pear trees and apple trees, apricots, cherries, figs, and loquats too. When Adel took long walks with his father in these orchards, Baba jan would lift him high up on his shoulders and Adel would pluck them a ripe pair of apples. Between the compound and the orchards was a clearing, mostly empty save for a shed where the gardeners stored their tools. The only other thing there was the flat stump of what had once been, by the looks of it, a giant old tree. Baba jan had once counted its rings with Adel and concluded that the tree had likely seen Genghis Khan's army march past. He said, with a rueful shake of his head, that whoever had cut it down had been nothing but a fool.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a hot day, the sun glaring in a sky as unblemished blue as the skies in the crayon pictures Adel used to draw when he was little. He put down the can of apple juice on the tree stump and practiced juggling his ball. His personal best was sixty-eight touches without the ball hitting the ground. He had set that record in the spring, and now it was midsummer and he was still trying to best it. Adel had reached twenty-eight when he became aware that someone was watching him. It was the boy, the one with the old man who had tried to approach Baba jan at the school's opening ceremony. He was squatting now in the shade of the brick shed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He told Adel that this was his first time in Afghanistan. He had lived his whole life in Pakistan in the Jalozai refugee camp where he'd been born. He said Jalozai had been like a city, a huge maze of tents and mud huts and homes built from plastic and aluminum siding in a labyrinth of narrow passageways littered with dirt and shit. It was a city in the belly of a yet greater city. He and his brothers -- he was the eldest by three years -- were raised in the camp. He had lived in a small mud house there with his brothers, his mother, his father, whose name was Iqbal, and his paternal grandmother, Parwana. In its alleyways, he and his brothers had learned to walk and talk. They had gone to school there. He had played with sticks and rusty old bicycle wheels on its dirt streets, running around with other refugee kids, until the sun dipped and his grandmother called him home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉阿德尔，这是他头一次到阿富汗。他过去一直住在巴基斯坦的贾洛扎伊难民营，他也是在那儿出生的。他说贾洛扎伊就像一座城市，一个巨大的迷宫，有帐篷，有小泥屋，还有用塑料布和铝墙板搭的住所，一条条狭窄的过道让人辨不清东南西北，垃圾和粪便到处都是。它又像城中城，位于一座更大的城市的腹地。他和弟弟们都是在营里长大的。他是老大，比大弟弟年长三岁。他和弟弟们，还有母亲、父亲、奶奶一起，住一间小泥屋。他父亲叫伊克巴尔，奶奶叫帕尔瓦娜。在难民营的小巷子里，他和弟弟们学会了走路和说话。他们也在那儿上学。他在肮脏的街道上玩，玩棍子和生锈的旧自行车轱辘，和别的难民小孩一起到处瞎跑，一直玩到太阳落山，奶奶叫他回家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They talked idly about soccer for a while, and, to Adel's pleasant surprise, Gholam's knowledge turned out to be solid. They exchanged favorite match and favorite goal stories. They each offered a top-five-players list; mostly it was the same except Gholam's included Ronaldo the Brazilian and Adel's had Ronaldo the Portuguese. Inevitably, they got around to the 2006 Finals and the painful memory, for Adel, of the head-butting incident. Gholam said he watched the whole match standing with a crowd outside the window of a TV shop not far from the camp.</div>

The sound of rickshaws outside, sputtering up and down the street, cars rumbling. The young girl on the mattress, finishing a plate of biryani, chewing and looking at him without any expression. How he could tell, even in the dim light, that she had a pretty face and that she was hardly any older than he.

The glimpses Gholam had allowed Adel into his life suggested an existence rife with trouble, unpredictability, hardship, but also adventure, a life worlds removed from Adel's own, though it unfolded practically within spitting distance of him.

<div class="line_en">But nothing was the same. Gholam may have cracked a door open to him, but it was Baba jan who had pushed him through it. Dormant gears in Adel's mind had begun to turn. Adel felt as though, overnight, he had acquired an altogether new auxiliary sense, one that empowered him to perceive things he never had before, things that had stared him in the face for years. He saw, for instance, how his mother had secrets inside of her. When he looked at her, they practically rippled over her face. He saw her struggles to keep from him all the things she knew, all the things she kept locked up, closed off, carefully guarded, like the two of them in this big house. He saw for the first time his father's house for the monstrosity, the affront, the monument to injustice, that it privately was to everyone else. He saw in people's rush to please his father the intimidation, the fear, that was the real underpinning of their respect and deference. He thought Gholam would be proud of him for this insight. For the first time, Adel felt truly aware of the broader movements that had always governed his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">This last discovery was, in some ways, the most surprising to Adel. The revelations of what he now knew his father had done -- first in the name of jihad, then for what he had called the just rewards of sacrifice -- had left Adel reeling. At least for a while. For days after that evening the rocks had come crashing through the window, Adel's stomach ached whenever his father walked into the room. He found his father barking into his mobile phone, or even heard him humming in the bath, and he felt his spine crumpling, his throat going painfully dry. His father kissed him good night, and Adel's instinct was to recoil. He had nightmares. He dreamt he was standing at the edge of the orchards, watching a thrashing about among the trees, the glint of a metal rod rising and falling, the sound of metal striking meat and bone. He woke from these dreams with a howl locked in his chest. Bouts of weeping side-swiped him at random moments.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something else was happening as well. The new awareness had not faded from his mind, but slowly it had found company. Another, opposing current of consciousness coursed through him now, one that did not displace the first but claimed space beside it. Adel felt an awakening to this other, more troubling part of himself. The part of him that over time would gradually, almost imperceptibly, accept this new identity that at present prickled like a wet wool sweater. Adel saw that, in the end, he would probably accept things as his mother had. Adel had been angry with her at first; he was more forgiving now. Perhaps she had accepted out of fear of her husband. Or as a bargain for the life of luxury she led. Mostly, Adel suspected, she had accepted for the same reason he would: because she had to. What choice was there? Adel could not run from his life any more than Gholam could from his. People learned to live with the most unimaginable things. As would he. This was his life. This was his mother. This was his father. And this was him, even if he hadn't always known it.</div>

But he would learn to love him again even if now it was a different, more complicated, messier business. Adel could almost feel himself leapfrogging over childhood. Soon, he would land as an adult.

He thought he would find the field empty. He would stand on the side of the road, picture Gholam and his mother and his brothers and his grandmother, the family a straggling line lugging roped-up belongings, padding along the dusty shoulders of country roads, looking for some place to land. Gholam was the head of the family now. He would have to work. He would now spend his youth clearing canals, digging ditches, making bricks, and harvesting fields.
