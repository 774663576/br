<div class="line_en">Mr March had lost most of his money helping a friend. When the two older girls discovered this, they wanted to do something to earn some money for the family, and as soon as they were old enough, they found work. Meg got a job teaching four small children. It was hard for her to be poor because she could remember the time when their home had been beautiful, with every thing they wanted. And every day at Mrs King's house she saw pretty dresses, and heard talk of parties and the theatre -- all the things which Meg loved.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beth was much too shy to go to school with other children, so she studied at home with her father. When he went away, and her mother was busy with war work, Beth continued to study by herself and helped Hannah keep the home tidy for the others. She also spent long, quiet hours alone, talking to her dolls or playing the old piano. Beth loved music and, although the family could not afford music lessons or a good piano for her, she tried hard to make herself a better musician.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon a week or two later, Jo went outside to clear the snow away from some of the garden so that Beth could walk there when the sun came out. She looked across to the house next door -- a big stone house with lovely things inside that Jo occasionally saw through the open curtains at the windows. But it seemed a lonely, lifeless kind of house, as no children played outside, no motherly face smiled at the windows, and not many people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一两个星期以后的一个下午，琼到外面去，想把花园里的部分雪清扫掉，这样白丝就可以在太阳出来时到那儿去散步了。她朝隔壁的房子看过去——那是座大砖房，里面有很多漂亮的东西，琼有时会从那些打开窗帘的窗户看到里面。可它看上去像是一座孤独的毫无生气的房子，没有孩子在外面玩，没有窗边慈母的笑脸，也没有许多进进出出的人，只有那个老先生和他的孙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
