<div class="line_en">District 2 is a large district, as one might expect, composed of a series of villages spread across the mountains. Each was originally associated with a mine or quarry, although now, many are devoted to the housing and training of Peacekeepers. None of this would present much of a challenge, since the rebels have 13's airpower on their side, except for one thing: At the center of the district is a virtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of the Capitol's military.</div>

<div class="line_en">We've nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayed Plutarch's "tough nut to crack" comment to the weary and discouraged rebel leaders here. The Nut was established directly after the Dark Days, when the Capitol had lost 13 and was desperate for a new underground stronghold. They had some of their military resources situated on the outskirts of the Capitol itself -- nuclear missiles, aircraft, troops -- but a significant chunk of their power was now under an enemy's control. Of course, there was no way they could hope to replicate 13, which was the work of centuries. However, in the old mines of nearby District 2, they saw opportunity. From the air, the Nut appeared to be just another mountain with a few entrances on its faces. But inside were vast cavern-ous spaces where slabs of stones had been cut, hauled to the surface, and transported down slippery narrow roads to make distant buildings. There was even a train system to facilitate transporting the miners from the Nut to the very center of the main town in District 2. It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during the Victory Tour, standing on the wide marble steps of the Justice Building, trying not to look too closely at Cato's and Clove's grieving families assembled below us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们给这个山起了个诨名叫“硬骨头”，因为我在对二区反抗军指挥官提到这座山时沿用了普鲁塔什的说法“难啃的骨头”。这座山久攻不下，二区的指挥官已经为此感到既疲惫又泄气。这块“硬骨头”是在黑暗时期结束后不久建造的，因为当时凯匹特刚失去了十三区，急于要建立一个新的地下堡垒。当时他们有一部分军事力量和武器装备集结在凯匹特郊外——核武器、飞机、军队——但是大部分都已经在敌方的控制之下。当然，他们不可能再重建具有十三区规模的军事堡垒，因为那是花费几个世纪时间建造起来的。然而，他们发现二区的废旧矿井也可以加以利用。从空中俯瞰，“硬骨头”与平常的山无异，只不过上面有几个入口而已。但在山体内，却隐藏着巨大的空间。大块山石被挖掘出来，拖到地上，然后再通过泥泞狭窄的山间小道，运送到远处用于建造房屋。在“硬骨头”和二区主要城镇之间甚至还建造了铁路来运送矿工。其中一条铁路直接通到二区司法大楼所在广场。当时我和皮塔参加胜利巡演时曾站在司法大楼门前的台阶上，不敢面对台阶下加图和格拉芙哀痛不已的家人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not the most ideal terrain, plagued as it was by mudslides, floods, and avalanches. But the advantages outweighed the concerns. As they'd cut deep into the mountain, the miners had left large pillars and walls of stone to support the infrastructure. The Capitol reinforced these and set about making the mountain their new military base. Filling it with computer banks and meeting rooms, barracks and arsenals. Widening entrances to allow the exit of hovercraft from the hangar, installing missile launchers. But on the whole, leaving the exterior of the mountain largely unchanged. A rough, rocky tangle of trees and wildlife. A natural fortress to protect them from their enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座山所处位置并不十分理想，泥石流、山洪和雪崩时有发生，但它仍有一定优势。在山体被开凿时，由于矿井在采矿过程中留下了许多起到支撑作用的石柱、石壁等，这对于基本设施的建造发挥了一定作用。凯匹特在对原有构造加强之后，建成了新的军事基地，里面装配了大量的计算机，还拥有会议室、兵营和武器库。他们将出入口扩大，以方便机库中飞机的出入，并建立了导弹发射平台。但山体外观基本没有改变，仍是山石耸立，林木茂密，野生动物出没。这种天然的恶劣环境恰使其不易被敌方攻破。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the other districts' standards, the Capitol babied the inhabitants here. Just by looking at the District 2 rebels, you can tell they were decently fed and cared for in childhood. Some did end up as quarry and mine workers. Others were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled into the ranks of Peacekeepers. Trained young and hard for combat. The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealth and a kind of glory not seen elsewhere. Of course, the people of 2 swallowed the Capitol's propaganda more easily than the rest of us. Embraced their ways. But for all that, at the end of the day, they were still slaves. And if that was lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers or worked in the Nut, it was not lost on the stonecutters who formed the backbone of the resistance here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在其他个辖区的眼里，凯匹特对二区可谓优宠有加。从二区反抗军的身上可以看得出他们衣食充裕，童年幸福。一些人长大后确实在采石场或矿井当了工人，其他一些人会接受教育到“硬骨头”里工作或者当治安警。他们从小受到训练，非常强悍，善于格斗。饥饿游戏被他们看做是一个致富成名的机会，这种观念在其他辖区是不多见的。当然，二区的人更容易受到凯匹特宣传的影响，也更易于接受凯匹特的思维方式。但不管怎么说，他们仍然是奴隶。如果说成为治安警或在“硬骨头”里工作的人没看到这一点，那么在采石场劳动的工人却不会迷失，而正是他们构成了主要的反抗力量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Things stand as they did when I arrived two weeks ago. The outer villages are in rebel hands, the town divided, and the Nut is as untouchable as ever. Its few entrances heavily fortified, its heart safely enfolded in the mountain. While every other district has now wrested control from the Capitol, 2 remains in its pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两周前我到达这里时，交战双方仍处于胶着状态。村子的外围已被反抗军控制，城镇里双方力量各据一方，但“硬骨头”却一如既往，坚不可摧。几个人口处的军事工事已被加强，中心固若金汤。在其他个辖区已被反抗军夺取的情况下，二区仍在凯匹特的掌控之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Each day, I do whatever I can to help. Visit the wounded. Tape short propos with my camera crew. I'm not allowed in actual combat, but they invite me to the meetings on the status of the war, which is a lot more than they did in 13. It's much better here. Freer, no schedules on my arm, fewer demands on my time. I live aboveground in the rebel villages or surrounding caves. For safety's sake, I'm relocated often. During the day, I've been given clearance to hunt as long as I take a guard along and don't stray too far. In the thin, cold mountain air, I feel some physical strength returning, my mind clearing away the rest of the fogginess. But with this mental clarity comes an even sharper awareness of what has been done to Peeta.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's only now that he's been corrupted that I can fully appreciate the real Peeta. Even more than I would've if he'd died. The kindness, the steadiness, the warmth that had an unexpected heat behind it. Outside of Prim, my mother, and Gale, how many people in the world love me unconditionally? I think in my case, the answer may now be none. Sometimes when I'm alone, I take the pearl from where it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy with the bread, the strong arms that warded off nightmares on the train, the kisses in the arena. To make myself put a name to the thing I've lost. But what's the use? It's gone. He's gone. Whatever existed between us is gone. All that's left is my promise to kill Snow.

Boggs, who came to 2 when I did, told me that even with all the plotting, it was a little too easy to rescue Peeta.

Programmed to murder me.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the brains are selected, I'm not surprised to see Gale's name on the list.

Originally, Gale offered to come with me to 2, but I could see I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee. I told him to sit tight and stay where he was most needed.

"Katniss," he says. The instant I open my eyes, the world seems disjointed. This is not our woods or our mountains or our way. My hand automatically goes to the scar on my left temple, which I associate with confusion. "Now kiss me."

<div class="line_en">I remember that day. Bitter cold and dark by four in the afternoon. We'd been hunting, but a heavy snow had driven us back into town. The Hob was crowded with people looking for refuge from the weather. Greasy Sae's soup, made with stock from the bones of a wild dog we'd shot a week earlier, was below her usual standards. Still, it was hot, and I was starving as I scooped it up, sitting cross-legged on her counter. Darius was leaning on the post of the stall, tickling my cheek with the end of my braid, while I smacked his hand away. He was explaining why one of his kisses merited a rabbit, or possibly two, since everyone knows redheaded men are the most virile. And Greasy Sae and I were laughing because he was so ridiculous and persistent and kept pointing out women around the Hob who he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy his lips. "See? The one in the green muffler? Go ahead and ask her. If you need a reference."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仍记得那一天。到了下午四点钟，林子里就已经又冷又黑了。我们打了一天猎，飘落的大雪使我们早早就准备收工了。霍伯黑市里挤满了躲避大雪的人。格雷西·塞在卖肉汤，她的肉汤里放了我们一周前打的野狗骨头，可那天汤的味道不如平时。不管怎么说，汤是热的，我也确实饿了，我盘腿坐在她的柜台上大口喝汤。大流士倚在小摊旁边的柱子上，正用我的辫子梢抚弄我的脸颊。我没好气地把他推开。大流士却在一旁不停地絮叨，说他的吻能抵上一只兔子，也许两只兔子，因为人人都知道红头发的男人是最有男人味的。格雷西·塞和我看着他可笑的样子忍不住一个劲地笑，他还透露霍伯黑市的某某为了尝尝他的美唇的滋味，给他的好处可不止一只兔子。“看见了吗？你个戴绿围巾的女人，如果你真想问的话，就去问问她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bright and early the next morning, the brains assemble to take on the problem of the Nut. I'm asked to the meeting, although I don't have much to contribute. I avoid the conference table and perch in the wide windowsill that has a view of the mountain in question. The commander from 2, a middle-aged woman named Lyme, takes us on a virtual tour of the Nut, its interior and fortifications, and recounts the failed attempts to seize it. I've crossed paths with her briefly a couple of times since my arrival, and was dogged by the feeling I'd met her before. She's memorable enough, standing over six feet tall and heavily muscled. But it's only when I see a clip of her in the field, leading a raid on the main entrance of the Nut, that something clicks and I realize I'm in the presence of another victor. Lyme, the tribute from District 2, who won her Hunger Games over a generation ago. Effie sent us her tape, among others, to prepare for the Quarter Quell. I've probably caught glimpses of her during the Games over the years, but she's kept a low profile. With my newfound knowledge of Haymitch's and Finnick's treatment, all I can think is: What did the Capitol do to her after she won?</div>

<div class="line_en">Gale, who is too restless to sit at the table for more than a few hours, has been alternating between pacing and sharing my windowsill. Early on, he seemed to accept Lyme's assertion that the entrances couldn't be taken, and dropped out of the conversation entirely. For the last hour or so, he's sat quietly, his brow knitted in concentration, staring at the Nut through the window glass. In the silence that follows Lyme's ultimatum, he speaks up. "Is it really so necessary that we take the Nut? Or would it be enough to disable it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖尔在桌子旁坐了几个小时了，早已不耐烦了，一会儿在屋子里踱来踱去，一会儿又坐到我坐的窗台上。开始，他好像和莱姆的看法是一致的，认为人口不可能攻破，所以已不再参加讨论。在刚过去的一个小时里，他一直一声不响地坐着，眉峰紧锁，透过窗户凝望着远处的“硬骨头”。莱姆说出最后通牒似的话之后，会议室一片寂静，这时他开口说道：“我们真的有必要攻入‘硬骨头’吗？把它摧毁是不是就够了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Lyme finishes the presentation, the questions from the brains begin. Hours pass, and lunch comes and goes, as they try to come up with a realistic plan for taking the Nut. But while Beetee thinks he might be able to override certain computer systems, and there's some discussion of putting the handful of internal spies to use, no one has any really innovative thoughts. As the afternoon wears on, talk keeps returning to a strategy that has been tried repeatedly -- the storming of the entrances. I can see Lyme's frustration building because so many variations of this plan have already failed, so many of her soldiers have been lost. Finally, she bursts out, "The next person who suggests we take the entrances better have a brilliant way to do it, because you're going to be the one leading that mission!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱姆介绍完战况，二区来的智囊团问了她许多问题。时间在一点一点地过去。大家吃了午饭继续讨论，试图找到攻破这座山的切实可行的办法。比特认为他有办法攻入敌方的计算机系统，也有人建议启用敌人内部的几个内线，事实上，没有人提出有新意的想法。在下午的时间悄然流逝的时候，人们的讨论又回到数次使用过的办法上——直接进攻敌人的入口。看得出莱姆很沮丧，因为数次这样的尝试已经失败。最后，她忍不住了，说：“如果有人建议直接进攻入口，他最好能想到好的进攻方法，因为这个人必须负责指挥这次攻坚战！”">查看中文翻译</div>
