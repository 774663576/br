<div class="line_en">Sadly, however, a shadow hovers over this present issue. The artist featured this quarter is Nila Wahdati, an Afghan poet interviewed by Étienne Boustouler last winter in the town of Courbevoie, near Paris. Mme. Wahdati, as we are sure you will agree, gave Mr. Boustouler one of the most revealing and startlingly frank interviews we have ever published. It was with great sadness that we learned of her untimely death not long after this interview was conducted. She will be missed in the community of poets. She is survived by her daughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Five years ago, when we began our quarterly issues featuring interviews with little-known poets, we could not have anticipated how popular they would prove. Many of you asked for more, and, indeed, your enthusiastic letters paved the way for these issues to become an annual tradition here at Parallaxe. The profiles have now become our staff writers' personal favorites as well. The features have led to the discovery, or rediscovery, of some valuable poets, and an overdue appreciation of their work.</div>

These calls are familiar to Pari, but repetition has not led to insouciance on her part. With each one she thinks, This time, this is the time, and each time she hangs up and rushes to Maman. In the parlance of economics, Julien has said to Pari that if she cut off the supply of attention, perhaps the demands for it would cease as well.</div>

You remember him. Back in a couple of days. Be a good girl. (Don't stay up late!) Je t'aime. Maman.

They remain, I suspect, a redoubtable seduction tool. She wears no makeup save for lipstick, a smudge of which has strayed a bit from the outline of her mouth.

This, you understand, in a country where kings had legions of concubines and never set eyes on most of the children they'd so frivolously fathered.

Women who are admired by some in the West -- here in France, for instance -- turned into heroines for their hard lives, admired from a distance by those who couldn't bear even one day of walking in their shoes. Women who see their desires doused and their dreams renounced, and yet -- and this is the worst of it, Monsieur Boustouler -- if you meet them, they smile and pretend they have no misgivings at all. As though they lead enviable lives. But you look closely and you see the helpless look, the desperation, and how it belies all their show of good humor. It is quite pathetic, Monsieur Boustouler.

If Dr. Delaunay thought he had seen theatrical earlier… Still, even if he couldn't come with her, Pari wishes he hadn't gone to dinner without her either. She is still a little astonished that he did. He could have explained it to Christian and Aurelie. They could have picked another night, changed the reservations. But Julien had gone. It wasn't merely thoughtless. No. There was something vicious about this move, deliberate, slashing. Pari has known for some time that he has that capacity.

<div class="line_en">It was in an emergency room not unlike this one that Maman first met Julien. That was ten years ago, in 1963, when Pari was fourteen. He had driven a colleague, who had a migraine. Maman had brought Pari, who was the patient that time, having sprained her ankle badly during gymnastics in school. Pari was lying on a gurney when Julien pushed his chair into the room and struck up a conversation with Maman. Pari cannot remember now what was said between them. She does remember Julien saying, "Paris -- like the city?" And from Maman the familiar reply, "No, without the s. It means 'fairy' in Farsi."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈芒第一次遇见于连，也是在急诊室，跟这一间可不一样。那是十年前了，是1963年，帕丽十四岁的时候。他开车送一个偏头疼发作的同事过来。妈芒领着帕丽。那一次帕丽是病人，在学校的体操课上，她扭伤了脚踝，伤得很厉害。帕丽躺在轮床上，于连拉了把椅子进房间，便和妈芒聊上了。帕丽现在想不起来他们俩当时都谈了什么。她只记得于连说：“帕丽——那不就是巴黎吗？”[3]然后是妈芒那百说不厌的回答：“不，没那个s。波斯语里是‘仙女’的意思。” 【注：[3]帕丽（Pari）和巴黎（Paris）在法语中同音。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before the meal they smoked, all three of them, and Maman and Julien had beer in oversize frosted mugs. They finished one round, Julien ordered a second, and there was a third as well. Julien, in white shirt, tie, and a checkered evening blazer, had the controlled courteous manners of a well-bred man. He smiled with ease and laughed effortlessly. He had just a pinch of gray at the temples, which Pari hadn't noticed in the dim light of the emergency room, and she estimated his age around the same as Maman's. He was well versed in current events and spent some time talking about De Gaulle's veto of England's entry into the Common Market and, to Pari's surprise, almost succeeded in making it interesting. Only after Maman asked did he reveal that he had started teaching economics at the Sorbonne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家饭前先抽烟，三个人都抽，妈芒和于连还拿特大号的磨砂玻璃杯喝啤酒。等两人都喝完，于连又要了两大杯，还有第三轮呢。于连穿着白衬衫，打领带，方格子的晚装西服，一个有教养的男人，彬彬有礼，收放自如，时而轻松微笑，时而放声大笑。此前在急诊室昏暗的灯光下，帕丽都不曾注意，他只在鬓角有少许花白，她估计他的年纪和妈芒不相上下。他通晓时事，津津乐道于戴高乐对英国加入欧洲共同市场的否决。出乎帕丽的意料，这些话题在他讲来倒也不失有趣。妈芒问到了，他才交底，说他已经开始在索邦教经济学了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They met him for dinner on a rainy night later that week at a small bistro off Boulevard Saint-Germain. Back at the apartment, Maman had made a protracted show of indecision over what to wear, settling in the end for a pastel blue dress with a close-fitting waist, evening gloves, and sharp-pointed stiletto shoes. And even then, in the elevator, she'd said to Pari, "It's not too Jackie, is it? What do you think?"</div>

A parenthesis-shaped piece of hair managed to fall on his brow, ever so gracefully -- too gracefully, perhaps. If, in fact, it was dangling there without calculation, Pari noticed that he never bothered to fix it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain outside rose in pitch, and the bistro grew more boisterous. As the waiter served them cheese puffs and ham brochettes, there followed between Maman and Julien a lengthy discussion of Bud Powell, Sonny Stitt, Dizzy Gillespie, and Julien's favorite, Charlie Parker. Maman told Julien she liked more the West Coast styles of Chet Baker and Miles Davis, had he listened to Kind of Blue? Pari was surprised to learn that Maman liked jazz this much and that she was so conversant about so many different musicians. She was struck, not for the first time, by both a childlike admiration for Maman and an unsettling sense that she did not really fully know her own mother. What did not surprise was Maman's effortless and thorough seduction of Julien. Maman was in her element there. She never had trouble commanding men's attention. She engulfed men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋外雨声高亢，小酒馆也愈发喧闹。跑堂的给他们端来奶酪泡芙和火腿烤串，妈芒和于连随即展开了冗长的讨论，涉及巴德·鲍威尔、桑尼·斯蒂特、迪齐·吉莱斯皮，以及于连深以为爱的查理·帕克。妈芒告诉于连，她更喜欢切特·巴克和迈尔斯·戴维斯的西岸爵士，他听过《几分蓝调》[5]吗？帕丽没想到妈芒这样喜欢爵士，对这么多不同风格的音乐家如此熟悉。她受到了打击，这可不是第一次了，她既感到像小孩子一样对妈芒的崇拜，同时也有一种不安的感觉，因为她对自己的母亲并没有完全了解。有一件事倒不让人吃惊，那就是妈芒对于连既轻松随意，又技艺精湛的引诱。妈芒干起来得心应手。在吸引男人的注意力上，她向来不会觉得力不从心。对男人们，她总是狼吞虎咽。【注：[5] 《几分蓝调》（Kind of Blue），爵士乐手迈尔斯·戴维斯1959年发行的唱片。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pari watched Maman as she murmured playfully, giggled at Julien's jokes, tilted her head and absently twirled a lock of her hair. She marveled again at how young and beautiful Maman was -- Maman, who was only twenty years older than herself. Her long dark hair, her full chest, her startling eyes, and a face that glowed with the intimidating sheen of classic regal features. Pari marveled further at how little resemblance she herself bore to Maman, with her solemn pale eyes, her long nose, her gap-toothed smile, and her small breasts. If she had any beauty, it was of a more modest earthbound sort. Being around her mother always reminded Pari that her own looks were woven of common cloth. At times, it was Maman herself who did the reminding, though it always came hidden in a Trojan horse of compliments.</div>

<div class="line_en">She didn't resemble her father much either, Pari believed. He had been a tall man with a serious face, a high forehead, narrow chin, and thin lips. Pari kept a few pictures of him in her room from her childhood in the Kabul house. He had fallen ill in 1955-- which was when Maman and she had moved to Paris -- and had died shortly after. Sometimes Pari found herself gazing at one of his old photos, particularly a black-and-white of the two of them, she and her father, standing before an old American car. He was leaning against the fender and she was in his arms, both of them smiling.

<div class="line_en">Seeing her father's face in those photos stirred an old sensation in Pari, a feeling that she had had for as long as she could remember. That there was in her life the absence of something, or someone, fundamental to her own existence. Sometimes it was vague, like a message sent across shadowy byways and vast distances, a weak signal on a radio dial, remote, warbled. Other times it felt so clear, this absence, so intimately close it made her heart lurch. For instance, in Provence two years earlier when Pari had seen a massive oak tree outside a farmhouse. Another time at the Jardin des Tuileries when she had watched a young mother pull her son in a little red Radio Flyer Wagon. Pari didn't understand. She read a story once about a middle-aged Turkish man who had suddenly slipped into a deep depression when the twin brother he never knew existed had suffered a fatal heart attack while on a canoe excursion in the Amazon rain forest. It was the closest anyone had ever come to articulating what she felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看着照片上父亲的脸，一直以来都存在的那种感觉在帕丽心头再度升起。从记事的时候起，她一直都有这种感觉，这种在她的生活中，某种东西或某个人缺失的感觉，对她自身的存在来说，缺失的东西或人又是不可或缺的。有时候，这种感觉朦朦胧胧，像一个信号，穿越了晦暗的小径和浩瀚的荒野，化作收音机里一声细弱的呼叫，遥远而飘忽不定。还有些时候，这种缺失的感觉却是那样清晰，那样亲密，仿佛触手可及，让她的心猛然沉落下去。比如两年前在普罗旺斯，帕丽看到农屋前有棵大橡树的时候。还有一次是在杜伊勒里公园，她看到有个年轻的母亲拉着红色的玩具车，车里坐着她儿子。帕丽想不明白。她曾经读到过一篇报道，说的是一个土耳其中年男子突然陷入了深度抑郁，而就在此时，他完全不知道有过的双胞胎兄弟正划着独木舟，在亚马逊雨林中漂流，致命的心脏病突然发作。要想清晰地反映她的感受，这件事是最接近的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shortly after they finished their meals, Maman excused herself to go to the bistro's bathroom and Pari was alone a few minutes with Julien. They talked about a film Pari had seen the week before, one with Jeanne Moreau playing a gambler, and they talked about school and music too. When she spoke, he rested his elbows on the table and leaned in a bit toward her, listening with great interest, both smiling and frowning, never lifting his eyes from her. It's a show, Pari told herself, he's only pretending. A polished act, something he trotted out for women, something he had chosen to do now on the spur of the moment, to toy with her awhile and amuse himself at her expense. And yet, under his unrelenting gaze, she could not help her pulse quickening and her belly tightening. She found herself speaking in an artificially sophisticated, ridiculous tone that was nothing like the way she spoke normally. She knew she was doing it and couldn't stop.</div>

"It was a physical relationship, really," he said. "C'était complètement sexuelle. She wanted to own me." He was looking at her when he said this and smiling a subversive little smile, cautiously gauging her reaction. Pari lit a cigarette and played it cool, like Bardot, like this was the sort of thing men told her all the time. But, inside, she was trembling. She knew that a small act of betrayal had been committed at the table. Something a little illicit, not entirely harmless but undeniably thrilling. When Maman returned, with her hair brushed anew and a fresh coat of lipstick, their stealthy moment broke, and Pari briefly resented Maman for intruding, for which she was immediately overcome with remorse.</div>

<div class="line_en">She saw him again a week or so later. It was morning, and she was going to Maman's room with a bowl of coffee. She found him sitting on the side of Maman's bed, winding his wristwatch. She hadn't known he had spent the night. She spotted him from the hallway, through a crack in the door. She stood there, rooted to the ground, bowl in hand, her mouth feeling like she had sucked on a dry clump of mud, and she watched him, the spotless skin of his back, the small paunch of his belly, the darkness between his legs partly shrouded by the rumpled sheets. He clasped on his watch, reached for a cigarette off the nightstand, lit it, and then casually swung his gaze to her as if he had known she was there all along. He gave her a closemouthed smile. Then Maman said something from the shower, and Pari wheeled around. It was a marvel she didn't scald herself with the coffee.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maman and Julien were lovers for about six months. They went to the cinema a lot, and to museums, and small art galleries featuring the works of struggling obscure painters with foreign names. One weekend they drove to the beach in Arcachon, near Bordeaux, and returned with tanned faces and a case of red wine. Julien took her to faculty events at the university, and Maman invited him to author readings at the bookstore. Pari tagged along at first -- Julien asked her to, which seemed to please Maman -- but soon she started making excuses to stay home. She wouldn't go, couldn't. It was unbearable. She was too tired, she said, or else she didn't feel well. She was going to her friend Collette's house to study, she said. Her friend since second grade, Collette was a wiry, brittle-looking girl with long limp hair and a nose like a crow's beak. She liked to shock people and say outrageous, scandalous things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大约六个月的时间里，妈芒和于连成了情人。他们常常去看电影，去博物馆，也去小画廊，那里展出的作品往往出自没什么名气的画家，顶着外国名字，正在奋斗。一个周末，他们驾车去了阿卡雄的海滩，就在波尔多附近，回来时带着晒黑的脸和一箱红酒。于连带她参加大学教员的活动，妈芒请他出席书店里的作家朗读会。一开始帕丽还跟着——于连要她去，似乎是为了取悦妈芒——没过多久她就开始找借口待在家里。她不愿意去，也不能去。去了就难以忍受。她说她太累了，要不就说她感觉不舒服。她说她要去朋友科莱特家学习。从二年级开始，科莱特就成了她朋友。她是个干瘦的，看上去弱不禁风的女孩，留着软塌塌的长头发，鼻子好像乌鸦嘴。她喜欢让人瞠目结舌，老说一些离谱的、恶心的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sometimes she walked like this, undressed, to her mother's room and lay on the bed where she knew Maman and Julien made love.

A paper bag stuffed with empty wine bottles sits on the table, precariously close to tipping over. Pari sees newspapers on the floor, one of them soaking up the blood spill from earlier in the day, and, on it, a single pink wool sock. It frightens Pari to see Maman's living space in this state. And she feels guilt as well. Which, knowing Maman, may have been the intended effect. And then she hates that she had this last thought. It's the sort of thing Julien would think. She wants you to feel badly. He has said this to her several times over the last year. She wants you to feel badly. When he first said it, Pari felt relieved, understood. She was grateful to him for articulating what she could not, or would not. She thought she had found an ally. But, these days, she wonders. She catches in his words a glint of meanness. A troubling absence of kindness.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had reconnected with him the year before, in 1973, for the first time in almost a decade. She had run into him at a street march outside the Canadian Embassy, a student protest against the hunting of seals. Pari didn't want to go, and also she had a paper on meromorphic functions that needed finishing, but Collette insisted. They were living together at the time, an arrangement that was increasingly proving to their mutual displeasure. Collette smoked grass now. She wore headbands and loose magenta-colored tunics embroidered with birds and daisies. She brought home long-haired, unkempt boys who ate Pari's food and played the guitar badly. Collette was always in the streets, shouting, denouncing cruelty to animals, racism, slavery, French nuclear testing in the Pacific. There was always an urgent buzz around the apartment, people Pari didn't know milling in and out. And when they were alone, Pari sensed a new tension between the two of them, a haughtiness on the part of Collette, an unspoken disapproval of her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only about thirty people showed up. There was a rumor that Brigitte Bardot was going to make an appearance, but it turned out to be just that, only a rumor. Collette was disappointed at the turnout. She had an agitated argument with a thin, pale bespectacled young man named Eric, who, Pari gathered, had been in charge of organizing the march. Poor Eric. Pari pitied him. Still seething, Collette took the lead. Pari shuffled along toward the back, next to a flat-chested girl who shouted slogans with a kind of nervous exhilaration. Pari kept her eyes to the pavement and tried her best to not stand out.</div>

Half the time, the poor animal hasn't even died yet, and the bastards stick their hooks in it and drag it out to the boat. They skin them alive, Pari. Alive!" The way Collette said this last thing, the way she emphasized it, made Pari want to apologize. For what, she was not quite sure, but she knew that, these days, it squeezed the breath out of her being around Collette and her reproaches and many outrages.</div>

She was too watchful, too sensible, too compromising and adaptable, on the whole steadier and less exhausting than either Maman or Collette. But these were not qualities that drew men in droves.

<div class="line_en">Later, he asked, and she told him, about her studies and her focus on complex variables. He listened in a way that Maman never did -- Maman, who seemed bored by the subject and mystified by Pari's passion for it. Maman couldn't even feign interest. She made lighthearted jokes that, on the surface, appeared to poke fun at her own ignorance. Oh là là, she would say, grinning, my head! My head! Spinning like a totem! I'll make you a deal, Pari. I'll pour us some tea, and you return to the planet, d'accord? She would chuckle, and Pari would humor her, but she sensed an edge to these jokes, an oblique sort of chiding, a suggestion that her knowledge had been judged esoteric and her pursuit of it frivolous. Frivolous. Which was rich, Pari thought, coming from a poet, though she would never say so to her mother.</div>

I arranged clandestine rendezvous and slipped away from home, and, of course, someone would inform my father that I'd been spotted on the streets somewhere. They would tell him that I was cavorting -- they always put it like that -- I was "cavorting." Or else they would say I was "parading" myself. My father would have to send a search party to bring me back. He would lock me up. For days. He would say from the other side of the door, You humiliate me. Why do you humiliate me so? What will I do about you? And sometimes he answered that question with his belt, or a closed fist. He'd chase me around the room. I suppose he thought he could terrorize me into submission.

<div class="line_en">I sense that false modesty is not her suit and therefore can assume only that this is her honest assessment of these early writings. If so, it is a brutally unforgiving one. Her poems from this period are stunning in fact, even in translation, especially considering her young age when she wrote them. They are moving, rich with imagery, emotion, insight, and telling grace. They speak beautifully of loneliness and uncontainable sorrow. They chronicle her disappointments, the crests and troughs of young love in all its radiance and promises and trappings. And there is often a sense of transcendent claustrophobia, of a shortening horizon, and always a sense of struggle against the tyranny of circumstance -- often depicted as a never named sinister male figure who looms. A not so-opaque allusion to her father, one would gather. I tell her all this.</div>

When we returned, I was frail and withdrawn. I couldn't be bothered with writing. I had little interest in food or conversation or entertainment. I was averse to visitors. I just wanted to pull the curtains and sleep all day every day. Which was what I did mostly.

She had hung up knowing that for the rest of her life it would slam into her at random moments, the guilt, the terrible remorse, catching her off guard, and that she would ache to the bones with it.

<div class="line_en">Pari heads westbound, toward Pigalle, walking briskly, hands stuffed into the pockets of her raincoat. The sky is darkening rapidly, and the downpour lashing at her face is becoming heavier and more steady, rippling windows, smearing headlights. Pari has no memory of ever meeting the man, her grandfather, Maman's father, has seen only the one photograph of him reading at his desk, but she doubts that he was the mustache-twirling villain Maman has made him out to be. Pari thinks she sees through this story. She has her own ideas. In her version, he is a man rightfully worried over the well-being of a deeply unhappy and self-destructive daughter who cannot help making shambles of her own life. He is a man who suffers humiliations and repeated assaults on his dignity and still stands by his daughter, takes her to India when she's ill, stays with her for six weeks. And, on that subject, what really was wrong with Maman? What did they do to her in India? Pari wonders, thinking of the vertical pelvic scar -- Pari had asked, and Zahia had told her that cesarian incisions were made horizontally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕丽向西，朝皮加勒广场的方向走去。她两手抄在雨衣口袋里，疾步快行。天空在迅速转暗，扑面而至的暴雨下得越来越大，越来越没有减缓的迹象，雨水浮荡起一扇扇窗，模糊了一对对车灯的光。帕丽想不起自己是否见过那个男人，她的外公，妈芒的父亲。她只见过一张相片，是他在伏案读书，可她不相信这就是妈芒说的那个翘胡子的恶棍。帕丽认为自己看透了这个故事。她有自己的想法。在帕丽的故事里，他是个对女儿能否幸福感到合理担忧的男人，女儿深深的不快乐，带有自毁的倾向，不可遏止地破坏着自己的人生。这男人蒙受着耻辱，尊严一再受到冒犯，却依然对女儿不离不弃，她得病的时候还带她去印度，一陪就是六个星期。谈到这个问题，妈芒到底得了什么病？在印度又接受了怎样的治疗？帕丽满心疑虑，想起了妈芒下腹那条纵向的疤——帕丽问过这个问题，扎希娅告诉她，剖腹产的切口是要横切的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What Pari had always wanted from her mother was the glue to bond together her loose, disjointed scraps of memory, to turn them into some sort of cohesive narrative. But Maman never said much. She always withheld details of her life and of their life together in Kabul. She kept Pari at a remove from their shared past, and, eventually, Pari stopped asking.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pari read the piece three times back at the apartment. And she doesn't know what to think, what to believe. So much of it rings false. Parts of it read like a parody.

<div class="line_en">Pari does not know -- she does not know. And that, perhaps, may have been Maman's true intent, to shift the ground beneath Pari's feet. To intentionally unsteady and upend her, to turn her into a stranger to herself, to heave the weight of doubt on her mind, on all Pari thought she knew of her life, to make her feel as lost as if she were wandering through a desert at night, surrounded by darkness and the unknown, the truth elusive, like a single tiny glint of light in the distance flickering on and off, forever moving, receding.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps, Pari thinks, this is Maman's retribution. Not only for Julien but also for the disappointment that Pari has always been. Pari, who was maybe supposed to bring an end to all the drinking, the men, the years squandered making desperate lunges at happiness. All the dead ends pursued and abandoned. Each lash of disappointment leaving Maman more damaged, more derailed, and happiness more illusory. What was I, Maman? Pari thinks. What was I supposed to be, growing in your womb -- assuming it was even in your womb that I was conceived? A seed of hope? A ticket purchased to ferry you from the dark? A patch for that hole you carried in your heart? If so, then I wasn't enough. I wasn't nearly enough. I was no balm to your pain, only another dead end, another burden, and you must have seen that early on. You must have realized it. But what could you do? You couldn't go down to the pawnshop and sell me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pari steps beneath the awning of a brasserie to take refuge from the rain a few blocks west of the hospital where Zahia does part of her training. She lights a cigarette. She should call Collette, she thinks. They have spoken only once or twice since the memorial. When they were young, they used to chew mouthfuls of gum until their jaws ached, and they would sit before Maman's dresser mirror and brush each other's hair, pin it up. Pari spots an old woman across the street, wearing a plastic rain bonnet, laboring up the sidewalk trailed by a small tan terrier. Not for the first time, a little puff breaks rank from the collective fog of Pari's memories and slowly takes the shape of a dog. Not a little toy like the old woman's, but a big mean specimen, furry, dirty, with a severed tail and ears. Pari is unsure whether this, in fact, is a memory or the ghost of one or neither. She had asked Maman once if they had ever owned a dog in Kabul and Maman said, You know I don't like dogs. They have no self-respect. You kick them and they still love you. It's depressing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pari does meet Collette. They meet at a popular bar with a Moroccan design, violet drapes and orange pillows everywhere, curly-haired oud player on a small stage. Collette has not arrived alone. She has brought a young man with her. His name is Eric Lacombe. He teaches drama to seventh and eighth graders at a lycée in the 18th. He tells Pari he has met her before, a few years earlier, at a student protest against seal hunting. At first Pari cannot recall, and then she remembers that he was the one with whom Collette had been so angry over the low turnout, the one whose chest she'd knuckled. They sit on the ground, atop fluffy mango-colored cushions, and order drinks. Initially, Pari is under the impression that Collette and Eric are a couple, but Collette keeps praising Eric, and soon Pari understands he has been brought for her benefit. The discomfort that would normally overtake her in a situation like this is mirrored in -- and mitigated by -- Eric's own considerable unease. Pari finds it amusing, and even endearing, the way he keeps blushing and shaking his head in apology and embarrassment. Over bread and black olive tapenades, Pari steals glances at him. He could not be called handsome. His hair is long and limp, tied with a rubber band at the base of his neck. He has small hands and pale skin. His nose is too narrow, his forehead too protruding, the chin nearly absent, but he has a bright-eyed grin and a habit of punctuating the end of each sentence with an expectant smile like a happy question mark. And though his face does not enthrall Pari as Julien's had, it is a far kinder face and, as Pari will learn before long, an external ambassador for the attentiveness, the quiet forbearance, and the enduring decency that resides within Eric.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕丽果然和科莱特见了面。她们在一家很有人气的酒吧碰了头，这里有摩洛哥风格的装饰，紫罗兰色的帷幔，到处摆放着橘黄色的靠枕，小舞台上还有个头发卷卷的乌德琴手。科莱特不是一个人到的。她带了个小伙子来。此人名叫埃里克·拉孔布，在十八区的一所高中教书，给七年级和八年级的学生讲戏剧。他告诉帕丽，他过去见过她，那是几年前，有一次学生示威，反对捕杀海豹。一开始帕丽没想起来，后来才恍然大悟，他就是科莱特因为到的人少而拿来撒气的那个人，那个被科莱特捶胸脯的人。他们席地而坐，身下是蓬松的芒果色坐垫，然后点了酒水。刚开始的时候，帕丽以为科莱特和埃里克是一对儿，但科莱特对埃里克赞不绝口，没过多久帕丽就明白了，科莱特是为了她，才把埃里克带过来的。通常在这种情况下，她会觉得很不舒服，可她却在埃里克的局促不安中看到了同样的不适，她自己反而因此得到了缓解。埃里克动不动就脸红，脑袋瓜子乱晃，满脸歉意，窘态百出。帕丽发现他这副模样蛮好玩，甚至也蛮可爱的。她一边吃着面包和黑橄榄酱，一边偷偷打量着埃里克。他称不上英俊，头发长长的，软塌塌的，用一根皮筋扎在脑后。他天生一双小手，皮肤没有血色，鼻子太尖，脑门又太大，几乎瞧不见下巴，可他笑起来明眸皓齿。他还有个习惯，每说完一句话，就用一个满怀期望的微笑加个标点，那笑容活像一个开心的问号。这张脸虽然不像于连那样让帕丽着迷，可它远比于连那张脸亲切友善，而且用不了太久，帕丽就能发现，埃里克的身上蕴藏着一种驻外大使般的专注，文静安恬的克制，经久不衰的端庄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1985, when Isabelle is seven, Alain four, and little Thierry two, Pari accepts an offer to teach at a prominent university in Paris. She becomes subject, for a time, to the expected academic jostling and pettiness -- not surprising, given that, at thirty-six, she is the youngest professor in the department and one of only two women. She weathers it in a way that she imagines Maman never could or would have. She does not flatter or butter up. She refrains from locking horns or filing complaints. She will always have her skeptics. But by the time the Berlin Wall comes down, so have the walls in her academic life, and she has slowly won over most of her colleagues with her sensible demeanor and disarming sociability. She makes friends in her department -- and in others too -- attends university events, fund-raisers, the occasional cocktail hour and dinner party. Eric goes with her to these soirees. As an ongoing private joke, he insists on wearing the same wool tie and corduroy blazer with elbow patches. He wanders around the crowded room, tasting hors d'oeuvres, sipping wine, looking jovially bewildered, and occasionally Pari has to swoop in and steal him away from a group of mathematicians before he opines on 3-manifolds and Diophantine approximations.</div>

She was resistant at first to taking up the cello, and Pari had taken a few lessons with her as a show of solidarity. It proved both unnecessary and unfeasible. Unnecessary because Isabelle quickly latched onto the instrument of her own accord and unfeasible because the cello made Pari's hands ache.

<div class="line_en">They spend the days touring the island, driving up the northwest coast by the Serra de Tramuntana Mountains, stopping to stroll by the olive groves and into the pine forest. They eat porcella, and a wonderful sea bass dish called lubina, and an eggplant and zucchini stew called tumbet. Thierry refuses to eat any of it, and at every restaurant Pari has to ask the chef to make him a plate of spaghetti with plain tomato sauce, no meat, no cheese. At Isabelle's request -- she has recently discovered opera -- one night they attend a production of Giacomo Puccini's Tosca. To survive the ordeal, Collette and Pari surreptitiously pass each other a silver flask of cheap vodka. By the middle of act two, they are sloshed, and can't help giggling like schoolgirls at the histrionics of the actor playing Scarpia.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, Pari, Collette, Isabelle, and Thierry pack a lunch and go to the beach; Didier, Alain, and Eric had left in the morning for a hike along Sóller Bay. On the way to the beach, they visit a shop to buy Isabelle a bathing suit that has caught her eye. As they walk into the shop, Pari catches a glimpse of her reflection in the plate glass. Normally, especially of late, when she steps in front of a mirror an automatic mental process kicks into gear that prepares her to greet her older self. It buffers her, dulls the shock. But in the shopwindow, she has caught herself off guard, vulnerable to reality undistorted by self-delusion. She sees a middle-aged woman in a drab floppy blouse and a beach skirt that doesn't conceal quite enough of the saggy folds of skin over her kneecaps. The sun picks out the gray in her hair. And despite the eyeliner, and the lipstick that defines her lips, she has a face now that a passerby's gaze will engage and then bounce from, as it would a street sign or a mailbox number. The moment is brief, barely enough for a flutter of the pulse but long enough for her illusory self to catch up with the reality of the woman gazing back from the shopwindow. It is a little devastating. This is what aging is, she thinks as she follows Isabelle into the store, these random unkind moments that catch you when you least expect them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，帕丽、科莱特、伊莎贝尔和蒂埃里把午餐打包，要去海滩；迪迪耶、阿兰和埃里克一大早就走了，到索列尔湾去远足。前往海滩的路上，他们去了一家商店，给伊莎贝尔买她相中的游泳衣，他们走进店里的时候，帕丽在大玻璃上瞥见了自己的影子。通常来说，特别是最近这段时间，每当她走到镜前，一种机械的心理过程便投入运转，让她做好准备，迎接变老的自我。它起了缓冲的作用，减轻了她受到的震动。但是在商店的橱窗里，她毫无防备地看到了自己，脆弱地面对着未经自欺扭曲过的现实。她看见一个中年女人，穿着死气沉沉，松松垮垮的上衣，沙滩裙遮不住膝盖上松垂多皱的皮肤。阳光之下，白发尽露。虽然画了眼钱，用口红抹了嘴唇，她的脸还是会让路人看一眼便马上把目光挪开，好像人家看到的是个街牌，或邮筒上的号码。这一刻转瞬即逝，勉强来得及心头一颤，却又足够漫长，可以让她虚幻的自我，与现实中这个在橱窗里回望的女人迎头相遇。有点崩溃的感觉。这就是衰老，她这样想着，跟在伊莎贝尔身后走进了商店，这些残忍的时刻，就这样在你最意想不到的时候突然到来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, early in the spring of 2010, Pari receives a long-distance phone call. The call is not unexpected. Pari, in fact, has been preparing for it all morning. Prior to the call, Pari makes sure she has the apartment to herself. This means asking Isabelle to leave earlier than she customarily does. Isabelle and her husband, Albert, live just north of Île Saint-Denis, only a few blocks from Pari's one-bedroom apartment. Isabelle comes to see Pari in the morning every other day, after she drops off her kids at school. She brings Pari a baguette, some fresh fruit. Pari is not yet bound to the wheelchair, an eventuality for which she has been preparing herself. Though her disease forced her into early retirement the year before, she is still fully capable of going to the market on her own, of taking a daily walk. It's the hands -- the ugly, twisted hands -- that fail her most, hands that on bad days feel like they have shards of crystal rattling around the joints. Pari wears gloves, whenever she is out, to keep her hands warm, but mostly because she is ashamed of them, the knobby knuckles, the unsightly fingers with what her doctor calls swan neck deformity, the permanently flexed left pinkie.</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning, Isabelle has brought her some figs, a few bars of soap, toothpaste, and a Tupperware containerful of chestnut soup. Albert is thinking of suggesting it as a new menu entry to the owners of the restaurant where he is the sous-chef. As she unloads the bags, Isabelle tells Pari of the new assignment she has landed.

She gazes out the window in the direction of the brasserie, but what she sees is not the skinny waiter beneath the awning, black apron tied at the waist and shaking a cloth over a table, but a little red wagon with a squeaky wheel bouncing along beneath a sky of unfurling clouds, rolling over ridges and down dried-up gullies, up and down ocher hills that loom and then fall away. She sees tangles of fruit trees standing in groves, the breeze catching their leaves, and rows of grapevines connecting little flat-roofed houses. She sees washing lines and women squatting by a stream, and the creaking ropes of a swing beneath a big tree, and a big dog, cowering from the taunts of village boys, and a hawk-nosed man digging a ditch, shirt plastered to his back with sweat, and a veiled woman bent over a cooking fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕丽的手在颤抖。惊人的事情在她身上发生了。极其不寻常的事。她脑海中出现了一幅画面，一把斧头劈砍着泥土，突然，浓稠的黑色石油从地表喷涌而出。这就是发生在她身上的事，记忆被触动，从最深处向上升起。她凭窗远眺，呆望着啤酒屋的方向，可她看见的不是雨篷下那个店伙计，瘦巴巴的，腰扎黑围裙，抖着桌布，而是一辆红色的小勒勒车，轮子吱嘎作响，在长云铺卷的天空下颠簸向前，翻过山岭，爬过干涸的溪谷，在土黄色的山间上上下下，山景渐次浮现，又慢慢地隐没不见。她看见一棵棵果树，在园中扶肩而立，树叶轻阻了微风，又见一行行葡萄藤，与一座座平顶的小屋栉比相连。她看见了晾衣绳；女人们蹲在溪边；两根长绳支支扭扭，在一棵大树下来回摆荡；一条大狗面对着成群村童的逗弄，畏缩不前；一个鹰钩鼻子的男人在挖沟，衬衫已被汗水浸透，紧紧贴住了脊梁；还有个戴面纱的女人弯下腰，生火做饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But something else too at the edge of it all, at the rim of her vision -- and this is what draws her most -- an elusive shadow. A figure. At once soft and hard. The softness of a hand holding hers. The hardness of knees where she'd once rested her cheek. She searches for his face, but it evades her, slips from her, each time she turns to it. Pari feels a hole opening up in her. There has been in her life, all her life, a great absence. Somehow, she has always known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而在这一切的边缘，几乎出离于她的幻象之外，还有什么东西，最让她目光流连。一个难以捉摸的影子。一个人影。软，硬，两种感觉相伴而来。软的是一只手，牵着她的手。硬的是膝盖，她曾把脸枕在上面。她搜寻着他的脸，可每次朝它那边一望，它就躲开了，滑出了她的视线。帕丽感到心里撕开了一个窟窿。她的人生，她全部的人生，始终存在着一种巨大的缺失。冥冥之中，她总有这样的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
