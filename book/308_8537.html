<div class="line_en">Mrs Ferrars died on the night of the 16th 17th September -- a Thursday. I was sent for at eight o'clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There was nothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I opened the front door with my latchkey, and purposely delayed a few moments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that I had deemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning. To tell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am not going to pretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the next few weeks. I emphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me that there were stirring times ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九点刚过几分，我回到家，用钥匙开了前门的弹簧锁，故意在玄关磨蹭了一会儿，慢吞吞地挂好帽子和薄大衣。初秋的清晨寒意袭人，幸好我颇有先见之明，添了衣服。说实话，我那时相当沮丧，忧心忡忡。虽然当时我不可能预见到接下来几周的风波——我绝对不会那么做——但直觉却告诉我接下来的日子会麻烦重重。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the dining-room on my left there came the rattle of tea-cups and the short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="左边的餐厅里传来叮叮的茶杯叩击声，还有姐姐卡洛琳短促的干咳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that you, James?" she called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是你吗，詹姆斯？”她喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An unnecessary question, since who else could it be? To tell the truth, it was precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few minutes' delay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr Kipling tells us, is: "Go and find out." If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should certainly suggest a mongoose rampant. One might omit the first part of the motto. Caroline can do any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home. I don't know how she manages it, but there it is. I suspect that the servants and the tradesmen constitute her Intelligence Corps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in information, but to spread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多余一问。不然还能是谁？老实说，我刚才拖拖拉拉好几分钟，就是因为卡洛琳。“出去把事情查个清楚”是猫鼬家族的座右铭——这是文学家吉卜林说的。如果卡洛琳长出鬃毛，我们家可就猫鼬成灾了。“出去把事情查个清楚”的前两个字大可忽略，即便卡洛琳安坐家中，消息也能送上门来。她的诀窍我猜不透，但效果一目了然。估计她的智囊团是由村里的各路仆人和小贩们组成的。一旦她出门，目的可就不是打听消息了，而是散播消息。在这方面，她的天才也堪称举世无双。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these pangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise of Mrs Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within the space of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally aim at discretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually withholding all information possible from my sister. She usually finds out just the same, but I have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I am in no way to blame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正因为她这人尽皆知的个性，我才犹犹豫豫，能拖则拖。关于弗拉尔斯太太之死，无论我向卡洛琳透露多少口风，不出一个半小时，整个村子必将传得沸沸扬扬。出于一名医生的职业操守，我自然务求谨慎，所以久而久之就养成了一个习惯：任何消息都对姐姐留一手。虽然她到头来照样能查个一清二楚，但只要过错不在我，我也就心安了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Ferrars' husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has constantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion, that his wife poisoned him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗拉尔斯太太的丈夫一年前刚去世，卡洛琳始终坚信他是被妻子下毒害死的，却又拿不出半点真凭实据。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr Ferrars died of acute gastritis, helped on by habitual overindulgence in alcoholic beverages. The symptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not, I agree, unlike, but Caroline bases her accusation on quite different lines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一再表明，弗拉尔斯先生死于习惯性酗酒引发的急性胃炎，可她总是嗤之以鼻。急性胃炎和砒霜中毒的症状不乏相似之处，这一点我也认同，但卡洛琳另有自己的一套逻辑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You've only got to look at her," I have heard her say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你只要看看她就知道了。”这是她的原话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive woman, and her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very well, but all the same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris, and have not, on that account, necessarily poisoned their husbands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗拉尔斯太太虽然青春不再，仍旧风姿绰约，而且她的衣着尽管简单，却总是非常合体。不过话说回来，去巴黎购买时装的女人成千上万，总不见得人人都会毒死丈夫吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my mind, Caroline's voice came again, with a sharper note in it. "What on earth are you doing out there, James? Why don't you come and get your breakfast?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在玄关盘桓了许久，思索着这些事。卡洛琳又喊了一声，语调比刚才更尖锐：“你到底在干什么，詹姆斯？怎么还不来吃早饭？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time." She was quite right. I could have.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这段时间够你挂五六件大衣了。”她说得一点儿没错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I walked into the dining-room, gave Caroline the accustomed peck on the cheek, and sat down to eggs and bacon. The bacon was rather cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走进餐厅，照例吻了吻卡洛琳的脸颊，坐下开始吃鸡蛋和熏肉。熏肉已经凉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You've had an early call," remarked Caroline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一大早就出诊呀。”卡洛琳说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," I said. "King's Paddock. Mrs Ferrars."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="安妮是我们家的客厅女仆，挺不错的女孩，可惜多嘴多舌的积习难改。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a pause. I continued to eat eggs and bacon. My sister's nose, which is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does when she is interested or excited over anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默了片刻，我继续吃鸡蛋和熏肉。姐姐有一个又长又尖的鼻子，此时她鼻头微微一颤，这个动作一般表示她兴致正浓，或是情绪亢奋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can't know," I snapped. "I didn't know myself until I got there, and haven't mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she must be a clairvoyant."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不可能，”我厉声说，“连我也是到了现场才知道的，还没跟任何人提过。要是安妮连这都看得见，她一定是千里眼了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wasn't Annie who told me. It was the milkman. He had it from the Ferrarses' cook." As I say, there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information. She sits at home and it comes to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是安妮，是送奶工。弗拉尔斯家的厨师告诉他的。”我说什么来着？卡洛琳完全不必外出探听消息，只要坐在家中，情报就纷纷向她飞来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My sister continued: "What did she die of? Heart failure?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姐姐又问：“死因是什么？心脏病？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Didn't the milkman tell you that?" I inquired sarcastically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道送奶工没告诉你？”我不无讥讽地反问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sarcasm is wasted on Caroline. She takes it seriously and answers accordingly. "He didn't know," she explained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="讽刺对卡洛琳是没用的，她把这当成一个认真的问题，老实地回答道：“他也不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After all, Caroline was bound to hear sooner or later. She might as well hear from me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，反正卡洛琳早晚都能挖出真相，我不如直接告诉她算了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She died of an overdose of veronal. She's been taking it lately for sleeplessness. Must have taken too much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“死因是镇静剂服用过量。她近来失眠，一直吃药，大概吃得太多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nonsense," said Caroline immediately. "She took it on purpose. Don't tell me!" It is odd, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do not wish to acknowledge, the. voicing of it by someone else will rouse you to a fury of denial. I burst immediately into indignant speech.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“胡扯，”卡洛琳立刻反驳，“她是自杀的。信不信由你！”说来也怪，一旦你心底暗暗坚信的事情被别人戳穿，就难免恼羞成怒、矢口否认。一气之下，一连串话脱口而出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你的老毛病又犯了，”我说，“无凭无据就胡乱猜测。弗拉尔斯太太究竟为什么要自杀？一个寡妇，年纪轻轻，又很有钱，身体也不错，只要享受生活就好。她为什么要自杀？荒谬。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not at all. Even you must have noticed how different she has been looking lately. It's been coming on for the last six months. She's looked positively hag-ridden. And you have just admitted that she hasn't been able to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“荒谬。就连你也该注意到，她最近很不正常。六个月以来都这样，简直像被女巫附体了。你刚才不也承认吗，她这段时间总睡不好觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is your diagnosis?" I demanded coldly. "An unfortunate love affair, I suppose?" My sister shook her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你的高见呢？”我冷冷地问，“我猜是一场失败的恋爱？”姐姐摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Remorse," she said, with great gusto.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Remorse?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“悔恨？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. You never would believe me when I told you she poisoned her husband. I'm more than ever convinced of it now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对呀，我早说了，她丈夫是被她毒死的，可你从来都不信。现在我更坚信不疑啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think you're very logical," I objected. "Surely if a woman committed a crime like murder, she'd be sufficiently cold-blooded to enjoy the fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as repentance." Caroline shook her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这话不合逻辑，”我反击道，“如果一个女人冷血到了胆敢犯下谋杀罪行的地步，肯定会心安理得地享受胜利果实，不会那么多愁善感，因为良心谴责而后悔。”卡洛琳摇摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There probably are women like that -- but Mrs Ferrars wasn't one of them. She was a mass of nerves. An overmastering impulse drove her on to get rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply can't endure suffering of any kind, and there's no doubt that the wife of a man like Ashley Ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal " I nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那样的女人也许有——但绝对不包括弗拉尔斯太太。她特别容易激动。她是那种根本吃不了苦的人，一时冲动就会把丈夫干掉。毫无疑问，做阿什利·弗拉尔斯这种人的妻子，肯定少不了要吃苦——”我点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And ever since she's been haunted by what she did. I can't help feeling sorry for her." I don't think Caroline ever felt sorry for Mrs Ferrars whilst she was alive. Now that she has gone where (presumably) Paris frocks can no longer be worn, Caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions of pity and comprehension.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后她就整日为自己的所作所为担惊受怕。我真同情她。”依我看，弗拉尔斯太太在世的时候，卡洛琳可从未同情过她。既然她已去了再也不能穿巴黎时装的地方（大概如此吧），卡洛琳的态度也就有所松动，准备施舍一些惋惜和理解了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense. I was all the more firm because I secretly agreed with some part, at least, of what she had said. But it is all wrong that Caroline should arrive at the truth simply by a kind of inspired guesswork. I wasn't going to encourage that sort of thing. She will go round the village airing her views, and everyone will think that she is doing so on medical data supplied by me. Life is very trying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我明确告诉她，这些臆测纯属无稽之谈。其实她的观点并非毫无道理，至少我也暗暗赞同其中的一部分。但卡洛琳纯粹是在捕风捉影，只是碰巧遇到了真相，我决不能助长她的气势。要不然她会走遍全村散播那套理论，然后人人都会以为她是从我的诊断结果里得出这种结论的。人生艰难啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
