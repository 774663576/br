<div class="line_en">Elsa stands alone on the balcony of Granny's flat. They used to stand here often. It was here that Granny first pointed at the cloud animals and talked about the Land-of-Almost-Awake, just after Mum and Dad had got divorced. That night Elsa got to see Miamas for the first time. She stares out blindly into the darkness and misses her more than ever. She has been lying on Granny's bed, looking up at the photos on the ceiling and trying to figure out what Granny was talking about at the hospital when she said Elsa mustn't hate her. And also, "it's a grandmother's privilege never to have to show her grandchild who she was before she became a grandmother." Elsa has spent hours trying to work out what this treasure hunt is for, or where the next clue can be found. If there even is one.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, Granny thought efficiency was rubbish, and she couldn't give a crap about the negative effect of conflict. Elsa heard one of the doctors at Mum's hospital saying that Granny "could start a fight in an empty room," but when Elsa told Granny she just looked miffed and said, "What if it was the room that started it?" And then she told the fairy tale about the girl who said no. Even though Elsa had already heard it at least an eternity of times.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside, Mum is sitting on a high stool in the kitchen, talking on the telephone and fiddling restlessly with one of Granny's tea towels. She never seems to have to listen very much to what the person at the other end of the line is saying. No one ever disagrees with Mum. Not that she raises her voice or interrupts; she's just not the sort of person anyone wants to get on the wrong side of. Mum likes to keep it like this, because conflict is bad for efficiency and efficiency is very important to her. George sometimes jokes that Mum will give birth to Halfie during her lunch break, to avoid any negative effect on the hospital's general efficiency. Elsa hates George for making all those stupid jokes. Hates him because he thinks he knows Mum well enough to make jokes about her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里，妈妈正坐在厨房的高脚凳上讲电话，同时不安地折腾着外婆的一块茶巾。她似乎并没有听电话另一头的人在说些什么。从来没有人不同意妈妈的话，并不是因为她会用大嗓门打断别人的话，她就是那种你不希望跟她意见相左的人。妈妈喜欢保持这样，因为冲突会影响效率，而效率对她很重要。乔治有时开玩笑说，妈妈会在她午休时把“小半”生出来，以避免对医院的效率造成任何负面影响。爱莎讨厌乔治说那些愚蠢的笑话。她恨他，因为他是那么了解妈妈，都可以以此来开玩笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the queen simply forbade all conflict in Miaudacas. Everyone had to get along all the time. And because nearly all conflicts start with someone saying "no," the queen also made this word illegal. Anyone breaking this law was immediately cast into a huge Naysayers' Prison, and hundreds of soldiers in black armor who were known as Yea-Sayers patrolled the streets to make sure there were no disagreements anywhere. Dissatisfied with this, the queen had soon outlawed not only the word "no' but also other words including "not" and "maybe" and "well." Any of these were enough to get you sent straight to prison, where you'd never again see the light of day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，女王下令禁止密奥达卡斯发生任何冲突。每个人都得与他人相处和睦。因为几乎所有的冲突都始于某人说了“不”这个字，所以女王规定，说出这个字是违法的。任何人违反这条法律，都将立即被扔进一座巨大的“唱反调监狱”，上百名穿着黑色盔甲的士兵在街道上巡逻，以确保任何地方都没有分歧，他们被称为“遵命者”。对此仍不满意的女王很快又取缔了“不”之外的其他一些词，包括“不是”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Girl Who Said No' was one of the first stories Elsa ever heard from the Land-of-Almost-Awake. It was about the Queen of Miaudacas, one of the six kingdoms. In the beginning the queen had been a courageous and fair-minded princess very much liked by all, but unfortunately she grew up and became a frightened adult, as adults tend to be. She started loving efficiency and avoiding conflict. As adults do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说‘不’的女孩”是爱莎最早听过的不眠大陆故事之一，讲的是六大王国之一的密奥达卡斯的女王的故事。起初，女王是一个勇敢而公正的公主，人人都喜欢她，但不幸的是，她长大了，变成了一个胆小的成年人，就像大多数普通的成年人那样。她开始讲求效率，避免冲突。成年人就是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a couple of years, words like "possibly" and "if" and "wait and see" had also been made illegal. In the end no one dared say anything at all. And then the queen felt that she might as well make all talking illegal, because almost every conflict tended to start with someone saying something. And after that there was silence in the kingdom for several years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可能”“大概”，说出这些词都足以将你直接送进监狱，再也见不到光明的一天。几年后，像“也许”“如果”“等着瞧”之类的词也被禁止。最后，没有人敢说任何话。然后女王觉得她索性可以把说话也禁掉，因为几乎所有冲突都始于某人说了某些话。此后，整个王国沉默了好几年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Until one day a little girl came riding in, singing as she went. And everyone stared at her, because singing was an extremely serious crime in Miaudacas, because there was a risk of one person liking the song and another disliking it. The Yea-Sayers sprang into action to stop the girl, but they couldn't catch her because she was very good at running. So the Yea-Sayers rang all the bells and called for reinforcements. Upon which the queen's very own elite force, known as the Paragraph Riders -- because they rode a very special kind of animal that was a cross between a giraffe and a rule book -- came out to stop the girl. But not even the Paragraph Riders could lay their hands on her, and in the end the queen in person came rushing out of her castle and roared at the girl to stop singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到有一天，一个小女孩骑马进城，边走边唱。每个人都盯着她。唱歌也是密奥达卡斯一项极其严重的罪行，因为有引起冲突的风险：有人喜欢这首歌，而另一些人不喜欢。“遵命者”立即行动起来，想要阻止女孩，但他们抓不住她，因为她很擅长逃跑。于是，“遵命者”敲响了所有的警钟，呼叫增援。女王的精英部队——他们被称为“段落骑手”，因为他们骑着一种非常特殊的、介于长颈鹿和规章手册之间的动物，出来阻止女孩。但即使是“段落骑手”也抓不住她，最后女王亲自冲出城堡，对着女孩咆哮，叫她停止歌唱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But then the girl turned to the queen, stared her right in the eye, and said "No." And as soon as she had said it, a piece of masonry fell off the wall around the prison. And when the girl said "No' one more time, another piece of masonry fell. And before long, not only the girl but all the other people in the kingdom, even the Yea-Sayers and the Paragraph Riders, were shouting "No! No! No!" and then the prison crumbled. And that was how the people of Miaudacas learned that a queen only stays in power for as long as her subjects are afraid of conflict.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女孩转向女王，盯着她的眼睛说：“不。”她一说出这个字，一块砖石就从监狱的墙上掉了下来。女孩又说了一次“不”，另一块砖石落下。没过多久，不仅是女孩，王国里其他所有人，甚至“遵命者”和“段落骑手”都高喊着：“不！不！不！”最后监狱颤抖着倒塌。密奥达卡斯的人们终于明白，一位女王能够掌握大权只因为她的臣民们都害怕冲突。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or at least Elsa thinks that was the moral of the story. She knows this partly because she checked out "moral" on Wikipedia and partly because the very first word Elsa learned to say was "no." Which led to a lot of arguing between Mum and Granny.</div>
