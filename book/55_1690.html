<div class="line_en">For most of the history of civilization, the practice of slavery was the rule rather than the exception. It was upheld in the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, and was justified by Plato and Aristotle as a natural institution that was essential to civilized society. So-called democratic Athens in the time of Pericles enslaved 35 percent of its population, as did the Roman Republic. Slaves have always been a major booty in wartime, and stateless people of all races were vulnerable to capture. The word slave comes from Slav, because, as the dictionary informs us, "Slavic peoples were widely captured and enslaved during the Middle Ages." States and armed forces, when they were not used as enslaving devices, were used as enslavement-prevention devices, as we are reminded by the lyric "Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves. Britons never, never, never shall be slaves." Well before Africans were enslaved by Europeans, they were enslaved by other Africans, as well as by Islamic states in North Africa and the Middle East. Some of those states did not abolish legal slavery until recently: Qatar in 1952. Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 1962; Mauritania in 1980.</div>

<div class="line_en">For captives in war, slavery was often a better fate than the alternative, massacre, and in many societies slavery shaded into milder forms of servitude, employment, military service, and occupational guilds. But violence is inherent to the definition of slavery -- if a person did all the work of a slave but had the option of quitting at any time without being physically restrained or punished, we would not call him a slave -- and this violence was often a regular part of a slave's life. Exodus 21:20-21 decrees, "When a slave-owner strikes a male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies immediately, the owner shall be punished. But if the slave survives for a day or two, there is no punishment; for the slave is the owner's property." Slaves' lack of ownership of their own bodies left even the better-treated ones vulnerable to vicious exploitation. Women in harems were perpetual rape victims, and the men who guarded them, eunuchs, had their testicles -- or in the case of black eunuchs, their entire genitalia -- hacked off with a knife and cauterized with boiling butter so they would not bleed to death from the wound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在战争中被俘为奴，做奴隶的命运总要好过被屠杀。在很多社会，奴隶制渐渐转变为较温和的隶属形式，比如仆役、雇佣、军队服务和行会。但是，暴力是奴隶制最核心的本义——如果一个人承担了一个奴隶的全部工作，但是能够不受暴力限制和惩罚地选择随时退出，我们就不能称他为奴隶——暴力是奴隶生活中的常项。《圣经·出埃及记》第21章第20—21节说：“人若用棍子打奴仆或婢女，立时死在他的手下，他必要受刑；若过一两天才死，就可以不受刑，因为是用钱买的。”奴隶没有身体所有权，即使那些境遇较好的奴隶也逃不出被残酷剥削的命运。妓院里的女奴被长期地、无休止地强奸，而看守她们的男人都是阉人。阉人的睾丸（某些黑人阉人的整个外生殖器）被割下后，敷上滚热的黄油止血，以免因失血过多而送命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The African slave trade in particular was among the most brutal chapters in human history. Between the 16th and 19th centuries at least 1.5 million Africans died in transatlantic slave ships, chained together in stifling, filth-ridden holds, and as one observer noted, "those who remain to meet the shore present a picture of wretchedness language cannot express." Millions more perished in forced marches through jungles and deserts to slave markets on the coast or in the Middle East. Slave traders treated their cargo according to the business model of ice merchants, who accept that a certain proportion of their goods will be lost in transport. At least 17 million Africans, and perhaps as many as 65 million, died in the slave trade. The slave trade not only killed people in transit, but by providing a continuous stream of bodies, it encouraged slaveholders to work their slaves to death and replace them with new ones. But even the slaves who were kept in relatively good health lived in the shadow of flogging, rape, mutilation, forced separation from family members, and summary execution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="非洲的奴隶贸易是人类历史上最残酷的篇章。16世纪到19世纪之间，至少150万非洲人惨死在横穿大洋的运奴船上。他们被用锁链拴在拥挤不堪、布满污秽的船舱底部。一位观察者说：“那些活着抵岸的人，形状之悲惨，无以言表。”此外，在到达海岸或者中东的奴隶市场之前，大批人被迫徒步穿过雨林或沙漠，有成百万上千万的人在途中殒命。奴隶贩子用贩运冰块的商业模式对待自己的货物，即在运输过程中，损失相当一部分的货物属于正常。至少有1700万甚至可能多达6500万的非洲人在奴隶贸易中死亡。奴隶贸易不仅在运输途中残害生命，因为有源源不断的新奴隶供给，奴隶主毫不吝惜奴隶的生命，把他们往死里使用，然后再买进新的奴隶。即使是那些尚能保持健康的奴隶，也是生活在鞭笞、强暴、肢体伤残、骨肉分离和就地正法的阴影之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why did people eventually forswear the ultimate labor-saving device? Historians have long debated the extent to which the abolition of slavery was driven by economics or by humanitarian concerns. At one time the economic explanation seemed compelling. In 1776 Adam Smith reasoned that slavery must be less efficient than paid employment because only the latter was a positive-sum game:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们为什么会逐渐地放弃了这种最廉价的人力工具？历史学家一直都在争论，废奴到底是受经济利益的驱动还是受人道关怀的驱动。经济利益驱动说曾经一度占了上风。1776年，亚当·斯密分析说，奴隶制肯定比有酬雇工缺乏效率，因为后者才是正和博弈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slaveholders in many times have manumitted their slaves, often in their wills, as they became personally close to them. In some places, such as Europe in the Middle Ages, slavery gave way to serfdom and sharecropping when it became cheaper to tax people than to keep them in bondage, or when weak states could not enforce a slave owner's property rights. But a mass movement against chattel slavery as an institution arose for the first time in the 18th century and rapidly pushed it to near extinction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当奴隶和奴隶主发展起私人的情谊，奴隶主也经常——通常是在遗嘱中——释放自己的奴隶。在某些地方，比如中世纪的欧洲，如果向人民征税比把人民捆缚起来做工更简便易行，或者弱势国家无力保护奴隶主的产权，奴隶制就开始转变为农奴制和租佃制。群众性废除奴隶制度的运动最早出现在18世纪，并迅速将奴隶制推向终结。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The political scientist John Mueller points out, "Smith's view garnered adherents, but not, as it happens, among slaveowners. That is, either Smith was wrong, or slaveholders were bad businessmen." Some economists, such as Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, have concluded that Smith was at least partly wrong in the case of the antebellum South, which had a reasonably efficient economy for the time. And southern slavery, of course, did not gradually give way to more cost-effective production techniques but had to be obliterated by war and by law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="政治学家约翰·米勒（John Mueller）说：“斯密的观点得到人们的推崇，但是，奴隶主们却不以为然。结论只能是，或者是斯密错了，或者奴隶主都是些算不清账的生意人。”有些经济学家，如罗伯特·福格尔（Robert Fogel）和斯坦利·恩格尔曼（Stanley Engerman）总结说，斯密的分析至少对美国内战前的南方来说是错误的，当地的经济运作相当有效率。南方的奴隶制不是逐渐被成本收益更高的生产技术所取代，而是被战争和法律所摧毁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took guns and laws to end slavery in much of the rest of the world as well. Britain, once among the most exuberant slave-trading nations, outlawed the slave trade in 1807 and abolished slavery throughout the empire in 1833. By the 1840s it was jawboning other countries to end their participation in the slave trade, backed up by economic sanctions and by almost a quarter of the Royal Navy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在世界上的大部分地区，也是枪炮和法律最后终结了奴隶制。英国曾经是贩奴生意最猖獗的国家，它在1807年宣布奴隶贸易非法。1833年，大英帝国全境废除奴隶制。到19世纪40年代，英国人开始喋喋不休地要求其他国家终止贩奴活动，并辅之以经济制裁和几乎1/4的皇家海军军力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most historians have concluded that Britain's policing of the abolition of slavery was driven by humanitarian motives. Locke undermined the moral basis for slavery in his 1689 work Two Treatises on Government, and though he and many of his intellectual descendants hypocritically profited from the institution, their advocacy of liberty, equality, and the universal rights of man let a genie out of the bottle and made it increasingly awkward for anyone to justify the practice. Many of the Enlightenment writers who inveighed against torture on humanitarian grounds, such as Jacques-Pierre Brisson in France, applied the same logic to oppose slavery. They were joined by Quakers, who founded the influential Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1787, and by preachers, scholars, free blacks, former slaves, and politicians.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分历史学家的结论是，英国制定废奴政策的动机是人道主义。洛克1689年的著作《政府论》动摇了奴隶制的道德依据，虽然他和他的思想继承人们实际上都是这一制度的获益人，他们倡导的自由、平等和普世人权仿佛放出了关在瓶子中的精怪，一旦接受了新的价值，任何人都感到越来越无法认同奴隶制度。启蒙时代出现了很多从人道主义立场抨击酷刑的作家，比如法国作家雅克—皮埃尔·布里松（Jacques-Pierre Brisson），他们也用同样的原则批判奴隶制。持相同立场的还有贵格会的教友，以及传教士、学者、自由黑人、获得了自由的黑奴，还有政治家。其中，贵格会在1787年创建了影响广泛的“废止奴隶贸易学社”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the same time, many politicians and preachers defended slavery, citing the Bible's approval of the practice, the inferiority of the African race, the value of preserving the southern way of life, and a paternalistic concern that freed slaves could not survive on their own. But these rationalizations withered under intellectual and moral scrutiny. The intellectual argument held that it was indefensible to allow one person to own another, arbitrarily excluding him from the community of decision-makers whose interests were negotiated in the social contract. As Jefferson put it, "The mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them legitimately." The moral revulsion was stimulated by first-person accounts of what it was like to be a slave. Some were autobiographies, like The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, the African, Written by Himself (1789) and Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845). Even more influential was a work of fiction, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, or Life Among the Lowly (1852). The novel depicted a wrenching episode in which mothers were separated from their children, and another in which the kindly Tom was beaten to death for refusing to flog other slaves. The book sold three hundred thousand copies and was a catalyst for the abolitionist movement. According to legend, when Abraham Lincoln met Stowe in 1862, he said, "So you're the little woman who started this great war."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，也有很多政客和传教士为奴隶制辩护，他们的论据包括《圣经》认可奴隶制，非洲人为劣等人种，保留南方生活方式，还有家长般的关切，即自由的黑人无法独立生存。但这些强词夺理在认知和道德的审判下退却了。在一个其成员利益由社会契约协商而定的社会中，一个人能拥有另一个自己的同类，并专横地将其排斥在社会成员之外，这对任何有理智的人来说，都是难以辩解的。杰斐逊这样说：“大部分人类生来背上并没有戴着马鞍，那些少数被偏爱的人生来也没有穿着马靴和马刺，能让他们理所当然地骑在别人身上作威作福。”最能激起道德反感的是以第一人称讲述的奴隶生活，比如1789年出版的埃奎亚诺的《一个非洲黑奴的自传》（The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano）和1845出版的《一个美国黑奴的自传》（Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass，an American Slave）。小说则更具感染力，如斯托夫人的《汤姆叔叔的小屋》（或叫《卑贱者的生活》，1852年）。小说刻画了最撕心裂肺的场景，母亲们被迫离开她们的孩子，善良的汤姆因拒绝鞭打其他奴隶而被殴打致死。这本小说销量达30万册，成为废奴运动的催化剂。甚至有这样的传说，亚伯拉罕·林肯在1862年见到斯托夫人时说：“原来你就是那位引发了这场伟大战争的小妇人啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Closely related to slavery is the practice of debt bondage. Beginning in biblical and classical times, people who defaulted on their loans could be enslaved, imprisoned, or executed. The word draconian comes from the Greek lawgiver Draco, who in 621 BCE codified laws governing the enslavement of debtors. Shylock's right to cut a pound of flesh from Antonio in The Merchant of Venice is another reminder of the practice. By the 16th century defaulters were no longer enslaved or executed, but they filled up debtors' prisons by the thousands. Sometimes they were charged for food, despite being broke, and had to survive on what they could beg from passersby through the windows of the jail. In early-19th-century America, thousands of people, including many women, languished in debtors' prisons, half of them for debts of less than ten dollars. In the 1830s a reform movement sprang up which, like the antislavery movement, appealed to both reason and emotion. A congressional committee argued that it ran contrary to the principles of justice "to give the creditor, in any case whatever, power over the body of his debtor." The committee also noted that "if all the victims of oppression were presented to our view in one congregated mass, with all the train of wives, children, and friends, involved in the same ruin, they would exhibit a spectacle at which humanity would shudder." Debt bondage was abolished by almost every American state between 1820 and 1840, and by most European governments in the 1860s and 1870s.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="债役是奴隶制的近亲。在《圣经》时代和古代，还不起债务的人就有可能被奴役、被监禁或者被处死。“严刑峻法的”（draconian）一词的词源是古希腊立法者德拉古（Draco）的名字，他在公元前621年制定法律，规定欠债者罚没为奴。《威尼斯商人》中夏洛克要求从安东尼奥的身上割下一磅肉的权利，也从一个侧面反映了这种制度。到16世纪，不履行债务的人不再被奴役或处死，但是成千上万的债务人塞满了负债人监狱。有时，他们虽然完全破产，但还要自理饭费，只有靠从监狱的窗口向过路的行人乞讨来维持性命。19世纪初的美国，数以千计的欠债人——其中包括很多妇女——被困在监狱中，半数以上人的债务还不到10美元。与反对奴隶制的运动一样，19世纪30年代兴起的一场改革运动，诉诸同样的理性和情感。国会的一个委员会在辩论时说：“如果所有这些被压迫的受害人聚集起来，和他们受到连累的妻子、儿女和朋友一起站在我们面前，那种场景会让人性战栗。”1820年至1840年，美国几乎所有的州都废除了债役，而大部分欧洲国家在19世纪60年代和70年代做了同样的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In 1865, after the most destructive war in American history, slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Many countries had abolished it before that time, and France had the dubious distinction of abolishing it twice, first in the wake of the French Revolution in 1794 and again, after Napoleon had restored it in 1802, during the Second Republic in 1848. The rest of the world quickly followed suit. Many encyclopedias provide time lines of the abolition of slavery, which differ slightly in how they delineate territories and what they count as "abolition," but they all show the same pattern: an explosion of abolition proclamations beginning in the late 18th century. Figure 4-6 shows the cumulative number of nations and colonies that have formally abolished slavery since 1575.</div>

<div class="line_en">The history of our treatment of debtors, Payne notes, illustrates the mysterious process in which violence has declined in every sphere of life. Western societies have gone from enslaving and executing debtors to imprisoning them and then to seizing their assets to repay the debt. Even the seizure of assets, he points out, is a kind of violence: "When John buys groceries on credit and later refuses to pay for them, he has not used force. If the grocer goes to court and gets the police to seize John's car or bank account, the grocer and police are the ones who are initiating the use of force." And because it is a form of violence, even if people don't usually think of it that way, this practice too has been in decline. The trend in bankruptcy law has been away from punishing debtors or squeezing assets out of them and toward giving them the opportunity of a fresh start. In many states a debtor's house, car, retirement accounts, and spouse's assets are protected, and when a person or company declares bankruptcy, they can write off many debts with impunity. In the old days of debtors' prisons, people might have predicted that this lenience would spell the demise of capitalism, which depends on the repayment of loans. But the commercial ecosystem evolved workarounds for this loss of leverage. Credit checks, credit ratings, loan insurance, and credit cards are just some of the ways that economic life continued after borrowers could no longer be deterred by the threat of legal coercion. An entire category of violence evaporated, and mechanisms that carried out the same function materialized, without anyone realizing that that was what was happening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩恩注意到，我们对待欠债人的历史勾画出一个暴力在生活的各个领域全面退缩的神秘进程。西方社会已经从奴役和处决欠债不还的人，变为监禁，再变为没收他们的财产抵债。他指出，没收财产甚至也还是一种暴力行为：“约翰用信用卡买了食品家用，随后拒绝付账，他并没有行使暴力。如果店家去法院起诉，得到警方出面没收约翰的汽车和银行账户，那么店家和警察就是首先使用了暴力”。因为这是一种暴力——虽然人们一般都不这样想，这样的操作也已经减少了。破产法的趋势是，尽量减少惩罚和挤压欠债人的资产，给予他们新的机会重新开始。在许多国家，欠债人的房屋、汽车、退休金和配偶的资产都是受保护的，当一个人或者一个公司宣布破产之后，他们可以不受惩罚地勾销很多债务。在欠债人塞满监狱的年代，人们会预言，这样的宽宏大量会彻底葬送资本主义，因为资本依靠的就是借贷还钱。但是商业生态系统继续着自己的进化，为失去了的杠杆寻找新的适应手段。当贷方不能再合法地对借方进行强制性的威胁后，信用检查、信用评级、贷款保险和信用卡等种种新手段应运而生，经济生活一直在继续。一整个类别的暴力就这样消失了，承担同样功能的新机制开始运作，没有多少人会想到它和原来曾经发生过的事情有何种关联。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slavery and other forms of bondage, of course, have not been obliterated from the face of the earth. As a result of recent publicity about the trafficking of people for labor and prostitution, one sometimes hears the statistically illiterate and morally obtuse claim that nothing has changed since the 18th century, as if there were no difference between a clandestine practice in a few parts of the world and an authorized practice everywhere in the world. Moreover, modern human trafficking, as heinous as it is, cannot be equated with the horrors of the African slave trade.

<div class="line_en">The identification of trafficking with chattel slavery -- in particular, the transatlantic slave trade -- is tenuous at best. In the 18th and 19th centuries, African slaves were kidnapped or captured in war. They were shipped to the New World into life-long servitude, from which they or their children could rarely escape. In contrast, although some trafficking victims are kidnapped, for most…, trafficking is migration gone terribly wrong. Most leave their homes voluntarily -- though sometimes coerced by circumstance -- in search of a materially better or more exciting life. Along the way, they become enmeshed in a coercive and exploitative situation. However, this situation rarely persists for life; nor… do the trafficked become a permanent or hereditary caste.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人口贩卖较之于贩奴，尤其是跨越大西洋的奴隶贸易，充其量也是微不足道的。在18和19世纪，非洲的奴隶是在战争中被劫持或者捕获的。他们被送往新大陆终生为奴，他们和他们的孩子都无法逃脱奴隶的命运。相比之下，虽然今天的人口贩卖中还有一些受害者是被劫持的，但对大多数人来说，是移民过程发生了可怕的意外。虽然也有被胁迫的情况，但他们中间的大多数是为了寻找更富裕或者更刺激的生活自愿离开家园的。他们在途中陷入了受威胁和受剥削的处境。无论如何，这种处境不会是终身性的，被贩卖的人也不会成为一个永久或者世袭的贱民阶层。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Feingold also notes that the numbers of trafficking victims reported by activist groups and repeated by journalists and nongovernmental organizations are usually pulled out of thin air and inflated for their advocacy value. Nonetheless, even the activists recognize the fantastic progress that has been made. A statement by Kevin Bales, president of Free the Slaves, though it begins with a dubious statistic, puts the issue in perspective: "While the real number of slaves is the largest there has ever been, it is also probably the smallest proportion of the world population ever in slavery. Today, we don't have to win the legal battle; there's a law against it in every country. We don't have to win the economic argument; no economy is dependent on slavery (unlike in the 19th century, when whole industries could have collapsed). And we don't have to win the moral argument; no one is trying to justify it any more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法因戈尔德还提到，人权团体报告的人口贩卖人数，被记者和非政府组织一再引用复制，通常都是无中生有，或者是为了支持他们倡导的价值观念而被大大地夸大了。尽管如此，人权活动家们也承认，情况已经有了显著改善。“解放奴隶”组织（Free the Slaves）的主席凯文·贝勒斯（Kevin Bales）发表过一个声明。尽管他以含糊的统计数据作为开场，却客观地描述了这个问题：“虽然奴隶的真实数字是有史以来最高的，但按世界总人口计算，奴隶所占比重也许是最小的。今天，我们不需要去打法律战，每一个国家的法律都反对奴隶制。我们也不需要去做经济论证，因为没有哪个经济是依赖奴隶制的（与19世纪不同，没有奴隶，整个产业都会垮台）。我们也不需要做道德论证，因为没有人还敢出来为奴隶制辩护了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Age of Reason and the Enlightenment brought many violent institutions to a sudden end. Two others had more staying power, and were indulged in large parts of the world for another two centuries: tyranny, and war between major states. Though the first systematic movements to undermine these institutions were nearly strangled in the crib and began to predominate only in our lifetimes, they originated in the grand change in thoughts and sensibilities that make up the Humanitarian Revolution, so I will introduce them here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理性时代和启蒙时代快速终结了很多暴力制度。但还有两种制度更顽固，在世界的大部分地区继续盘踞了两个世纪之久，它们是暴政以及国家之间的战争。尽管人类消除暴政和战争的第一波系统的努力几乎在摇篮中就夭折了，而且也仅仅是在我们这一代人才开始成为主流，但是，奠定了人道主义革命的新思潮和新理念，也正是今天抗拒暴政和战争新努力的思想源泉。我要在下文逐一说明。">查看中文翻译</div>
