<div class="line_en">The piano was right next to the bar where I was sitting and all, and old Valencia was standing practically right next to me. I sort of gave her the old eye, but she pretended she didn't even see me. I probably wouldn't have done it, but I was getting drunk as hell. When she was finished, she beat it out of the room so fast I didn't even get a chance to invite her to join me for a drink, so I called the headwaiter over. I told him to ask old Valencia if she'd care to join me for a drink. He said he would, but he probably didn't even give her my message. People never give your message to anybody.</div>

A flitty-looking guy with wavy hair came out and played the piano, and then this new babe, Valencia, came out and sang. She wasn't any good, but she was better than old Tina and Janine, and at least she sang good songs.</div>

But, boy, I could hardly see straight. When I was really drunk, I started that stupid business with the bullet in my guts again. I was the only guy at the bar with a bullet in their guts. I kept putting my hand under my jacket, on my stomach and all, to keep the blood from dripping all over the place. I didn't want anybody to know I was even wounded. I was concealing the fact that I was a wounded sonuvabitch. Finally what I felt like, I felt like giving old Jane a buzz and see if she was home yet. So I paid my check and all. Then I left the bar and went out where the telephones were. I kept keeping my hand under my jacket to keep the blood from dripping. Boy, was I drunk.</div>

<div class="line_en">I stayed in the damn phone booth for quite a while. I kept holding onto the phone, sort of, so I wouldn't pass out. I wasn't feeling too marvelous, to tell you the truth. Finally, though, I came out and went in the men's room, staggering around like a moron, and filled one of the washbowls with cold water. Then I dunked my head in it, right up to the ears. I didn't even bother to dry it or anything. I just let the sonuvabitch drip. Then I walked over to this radiator by the window and sat down on it. It was nice and warm. It felt good because I was shivering like a bastard. It's a funny thing, I always shiver like hell when I'm drunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在那个混帐电话间里呆了好一会儿。我使劲握住电话机，不让自己醉倒在地。说实话，我当时并不怎么好过。可是最后，我终于象个白痴似的跌跌撞撞地走了出来，进了男厕所，在一个盥洗盆里放满了凉水。随后我把头浸在水里，一直浸到耳朵旁边。我甚至没把头发擦干，听凭这个婊子养的去直淌水。随后我走到窗边电炉旁，一屁股坐在上面。这地方真是又暖又舒服。我坐着特别觉得舒服，因为我这时已经冷得索索乱抖。说来好笑，我只要一喝醉酒，就会冷得索索乱抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"G'night. G'night, Sally baby. Sally sweetheart darling," I said. Can you imagine how drunk I was? I hung up too, then. I figured she probably just came home from a date.

<div class="line_en">I didn't have anything else to do, so I kept sitting on the radiator and counting these little white squares on the floor. I was getting soaked. About a gallon of water was dripping down my neck, getting all over my collar and tie and all, but I didn't give a damn. I was too drunk to give a damn. Then, pretty soon, the guy that played the piano for old Valencia, this very wavy-haired, flitty-looking guy, came in to comb his golden locks. We sort of struck up a conversation while he was combing it, except that he wasn't too goddam friendly.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat-check room, I was crying and all. I don't know why, but I was. I guess it was because I was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome. Then, when I went out to the checkroom, I couldn't find my goddam check. The hat-check girl was very nice about it, though. She gave me my coat anyway. And my "Little Shirley Beans" record -- I still had it with me and all. I gave her a buck for being so nice, but she wouldn't take it. She kept telling me to go home and go to bed. I sort of tried to make a date with her for when she got through working, but she wouldn't do it. She said she was old enough to be my mother and all. I showed her my goddam gray hair and told her I was forty-two -- I was only horsing around, naturally. She was nice, though. I showed her my goddam red hunting hat, and she liked it. She made me put it on before I went out, because my hair was still pretty wet. She was all right.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't feel too drunk any more when I went outside, but it was getting very cold out again, and my teeth started chattering like hell. I couldn't make them stop. I walked over to Madison Avenue and started to wait around for a bus because I didn't have hardly any money left and I had to start economizing on cabs and all. But I didn't feel like getting on a damn bus. And besides, I didn't even know where I was supposed to go. So what I did, I started walking over to the park. I figured I'd go by that little lake and see what the hell the ducks were doing, see if they were around or not. I still didn't know if they were around or not. It wasn't far over to the park, and I didn't have anyplace else special to go to -- I didn't even know where I was going to sleep yet -- so I went. I wasn't tired or anything. I just felt blue as hell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我出去到了外边，酒就醒了好些，可是外边的天气冷得厉害，我的牙齿开始上下打起战来，怎么也止不住。我一直走到梅迪逊路，在那儿等公共汽车，因为我剩下的钱已经不多。我得开始节约，少乘出租汽车什么的。可我实在不想乘混帐公共汽车。再说，我也不知道往哪儿去好。所以我信步往中央公园那儿走去。我揣摩我也许可以到那个小湖边去看看那些鸭子到底在于什么，看看它们到底还在不在湖里。我依旧拿不准它们在不在湖里。公园相距不远，我也没有什么别的地方可去――我甚至都不知道去哪儿睡觉哩。我一点也不觉得困或者累。我只觉得懊丧得要命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I've lived in New York all my life, and I know Central Park like the back of my hand, because I used to roller-skate there all the time and ride my bike when I was a kid, but I had the most terrific trouble finding that lagoon that night. I knew right where it was -- it was right near Central Park South and all -- but I still couldn't find it. I must've been drunker than I thought. I kept walking and walking, and it kept getting darker and darker and spookier and spookier. I didn't see one person the whole time I was in the park. I'm just as glad. I probably would've jumped about a mile if I had. Then, finally, I found it. What it was, it was partly frozen and partly not frozen. But I didn't see any ducks around. I walked all around the whole damn lake -- I damn near fell in once, in fact -- but I didn't see a single duck. I thought maybe if there were any around, they might be asleep or something near the edge of the water, near the grass and all. That's how I nearly fell in. But I couldn't find any.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally I sat down on this bench, where it wasn't so goddam dark. Boy, I was still shivering like a bastard, and the back of my hair, even though I had my hunting hat on, was sort of full of little hunks of ice. That worried me. I thought probably I'd get pneumonia and die. I started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all. My grandfather from Detroit, that keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you ride on a goddam bus with him, and my aunts -- I have about fifty aunts -- and all my lousy cousins. What a mob'd be there. They all came when Allie died, the whole goddam stupid bunch of them. I have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there, D. B. told me. I wasn't there. I was still in the hospital. I had to go to the hospital and all after I hurt my hand. Anyway, I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia, with all those hunks of ice in my hair, and that I was going to die. I felt sorry as hell for my mother and father. Especially my mother, because she still isn't over my brother Allie yet. I kept picturing her not knowing what to do with all my suits and athletic equipment and all. The only good thing, I knew she wouldn't let old Phoebe come to my goddam funeral because she was only a little kid. That was the only good part.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the weather's nice, my parents go out quite frequently and stick a bunch of flowers on old Allie's grave. I went with them a couple of times, but I cut it out. In the first place, I certainly don't enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery. Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all. It wasn't too bad when the sun was out, but twice -- twice -- we were there when it started to rain. It was awful. It rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained all over the place. All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars. That's what nearly drove me crazy. All the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinner -- everybody except Allie. I couldn't stand it. I know it's only his body and all that's in the cemetery, and his soul's in Heaven and all that crap, but I couldn't stand it anyway. I just wish he wasn't there. You didn't know him. If you'd known him, you'd know what I mean. It's not too bad when the sun's out, but the sun only comes out when it feels like coming out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要天气好，我父母常常送一束花去搁在老艾里的坟墓上。我跟着他们去了一两次，以后就不去了。主要是，我不高兴看见他躺在那个混帐公墓里。四周围全是死人和墓碑什么的。有太阳的日子那地方倒还马马虎虎，可是有两次――确确实实两次――我们在墓地的时候忽然下起雨来。那真是可怕。雨点打在他的混帐墓碑上，雨点打在他肚皮上的荒草上。到处都是雨。所有到公墓里来凭吊的人都急急奔向他们的汽车。就是这一点，差点儿让我发疯。所有那些来凭吊的人都能躲进自己的汽车，听收音机，然后到什么安乐窝里去吃晚饭――人人都这样做，除了艾里。我实在受不了这个。我知道在墓地里的只是他的尸体，他的灵魂已经进了天堂，等等，可我照样受不了。我真希望他不躺在公墓里。可惜你不认识艾里。你要是认识他，就会懂得我说这话的意思。有太阳的日子倒还马马虎虎，可太阳只是在它想出来的时候才出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I thought about the whole bunch of them sticking me in a goddam cemetery and all, with my name on this tombstone and all. Surrounded by dead guys. Boy, when you're dead, they really fix you up. I hope to hell when I do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something. Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery. People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday, and all that crap. Who wants flowers when you're dead? Nobody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我又想起他们整整一嘟噜人怎样把我送进一个混帐公墓。墓碑上刻着我的名字，四周围全都是死人。嘿，只要你一死去，他们倒是真把你安顿得好好的。我自己万一真的死了，倒真他妈的希望有那么个聪明人干脆把我的尸体扔在河里什么的。怎么办都成，就是别把我送进混帐公墓里。人们在星期天来看你，把一束花搁在你肚皮上，以及诸如此类的混帐玩艺儿。人死后谁还要花？谁也不会要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while, just to get my mind off getting pneumonia and all, I took out my dough and tried to count it in the lousy light from the street lamp. All I had was three singles and five quarters and a nickel left -- boy, I spent a fortune since I left Pencey. Then what I did, I went down near the lagoon and I sort of skipped the quarters and the nickel across it, where it wasn't frozen. I don't know why I did it, but I did it. I guess I thought it'd take my mind off getting pneumonia and dying. It didn't, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，为了不让我脑子去想肺炎什么的，我就拿出钱来，映着街灯的那点儿混帐光线数了一下。统共只剩了三张一块的钞票，五个两毛五的和一个一毛的银币――嘿，我离开潘西以后，真正花掉了一大笔钱。接着我就走到浅水湖畔，找个湖水没冻冰的地方，把那几个两毛五和一毛的银币掠着水面扔了出去。我不知道我自己干吗要这样做，不过我当时的确是这样做了。我揣摩我当时准以为这么一来，就可以不去想肺炎和死亡的事了。其实哪有这样便宜的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I started thinking how old Phoebe would feel if I got pneumonia and died. It was a childish way to think, but I couldn't stop myself. She'd feel pretty bad if something like that happened. She likes me a lot. I mean she's quite fond of me. She really is. Anyway, I couldn't get that off my mind, so finally what I figured I'd do, I figured I'd better sneak home and see her, in case I died and all. I had my door key with me and all, and I figured what I'd do, I'd sneak in the apartment, very quiet and all, and just sort of chew the fat with her for a while. The only thing that worried me was our front door. It creaks like a bastard. It's a pretty old apartment house, and the superintendent's a lazy bastard, and everything creaks and squeaks. I was afraid my parents might hear me sneaking in. But I decided I'd try it anyhow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始想起万一我染上肺炎死了，老菲芘心里会有什么样的感觉。想这类事情当然很孩子气，可我禁不住要这样想。万一这样的事果真发生了，她心里一定很难受。她非常喜欢我。我是说她跟我很要好。一点不假。嗯，我怎么也摆脱不掉这念头，所以最后我打定主意，决计偷偷溜回家去看她一次，万一自己真的死了，也算是一次临死诀别。我身边带着房门钥匙，所以我决意偷偷地溜进公寓，悄悄儿地去跟她聊一会儿天。我最担心的是我家的前门。那门叽叽嘎嘎地响得要命。这所公寓房子已经很旧，管公寓的是个再懒也没有的杂种，里面的一切东西全都叽叽嘎嘎地直响。我很担心我父母会听见我溜进房去。可是不管怎样，我决定试一试。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I got the hell out of the park, and went home. I walked all the way. It wasn't too far, and I wasn't tired or even drunk any more. It was just very cold and nobody around anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此我就他妈的走出公园回家了。我一路步行回家。路并不远，我也并不觉得累，甚至连酒意都没有了。只是天冷得厉害，四周围没有一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
