<div class="line_en">"No, but others come in their places. Leave them be… but if they start throwing up hovels against the wall again, pull them down at once. The war's not done yet, no matter what these fools may think." He spied the Mud Gate up ahead. "I have seen enough for now. We'll return on the morrow with the guild masters to go over their plans." He sighed. Well, I burned most of this, I suppose it's only just that I rebuild it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing remained beyond the King's Gate but mud and ashes and bits of burned bone, yet already there were people living in the shadow of the city walls, and others selling fish from barrows and barrels. Tyrion felt their eyes on him as he rode past; chilly eyes, angry and unsympathetic. No one dared speak to him, or try to bar his way; not with Bronn beside him in oiled black mail. If I were alone, though, they would pull me down and smash my face in with a cobblestone, as they did for Preston Greenfield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王门外一片荒芜，惟有烂泥、灰烬和烧焦骨骸，但无家可归的人们已在城墙的阴影下重新搭起帐篷，还有人用桶子和推车贩卖渔获。提利昂骑过人群，觉察到无数的目光落在自己身上：冰冷、愤怒，乃至憎恶。但没人开口，也没人敢挡他的道——全赖一身油亮黑甲的波隆随侍左右。若我孤身出巡，只怕早就被他们拖下马来，用鹅卵石砸个稀烂了，就像普列斯顿·格林菲尔爵士那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cost of rebuilding was going to be ruinous, but there was no help for that. King's Landing was the realm's principal harbor, rivaled only by Oldtown. The river had to be reopened, and the sooner the better. And where am I going to find the bloody coin? it was almost enough to make him miss Littlefinger, who had sailed north a fortnight past. While he beds Lysa Arryn and rules the Vale beside her, I get to clean up the mess he left behind him. Though at least his father was giving him significant work to do. He won't name me heir to Casterly Rock, but he'll make use of me wherever he can, Tyrion thought, as a captain of gold cloaks waved them through the Mud Gate.</div>

Willem's twin Martyn had been taken captive by Robb Stark as well, and their elder brother Lancel was still abed, beset by an ulcerating wound that would not heal. With one son dead and two more in mortal danger, Ser Kevan was consumed by grief and fear. Lord Tywin had always relied on his brother, but now he had no choice but to turn again to his dwarf son.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Three Whores still dominated the market square inside the gate, but they stood idle now, and the boulders and barrels of pitch had all been trundled away.

<div class="line_en">He was in a black mood, and not just because a few street urchins wanted to pelt him with dung. His marriage was a daily agony. Sansa Stark remained a maiden, and half the castle seemed to know it. When they had saddled up this morning, he'd heard two of the stableboys sniggering behind his back. He could almost imagine that the horses were sniggering as well. He'd risked his skin to avoid the bedding ritual, hoping to preserve the privacy of his bedchamber, but that hope had been dashed quick enough. Either Sansa had been stupid enough to confide in one of her bedmaids, every one of whom was a spy for Cersei, or Varys and his little birds were to blame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的心情本就不好，而今这群顽童竟然当众羞辱他，更让他怒火万丈。日复一日，婚姻成了他最大的苦恼。珊莎·史塔克至今仍是处女，而大半个城堡的人似乎都知道！今早上马时，他就听见两名马童在背后叽叽咕咕，偷笑出声。他觉得连马儿都在嘲弄他。一直以来，提利昂每晚耐着性子假装履行义务，寄希望于婚姻的实情不致泄露，可惜一切都归无用。不知是珊莎蠢到向她的侍女倾诉呢？——毫无疑问，她们都是瑟曦的人——还是瓦里斯的小小鸟在作怪？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Remind me to tell Ser Addam to post some gold cloaks here," Tyrion told Bronn as they rode between two of the trebuchets. "Some fool boy's like to fall off and break his back." There was a shout from above, and a clod of manure exploded on the ground a foot in front of them. Tyrion's mare reared and almost threw him. "On second thoughts," he said when he had the horse in hand, "let the poxy brats splatter on the cobbles like overripe melons."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa's misery was deepening every day. Tyrion would gladly have broken through her courtesy to give her what solace he might, but it was no good. No words would ever make him fair in her eyes. Or any less a Lannister. This was the wife they had given him, for all the rest of his life, and she hated him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎过得也很凄惨。提利昂每每想打破她用礼貌编织的盔甲，给予她男人的慰籍，但他知道没用。不管嘴上说得多动听，在她眼底，他其实是个丑陋不堪的怪物。况且还是个兰尼斯特。这就是他们给他的妻子，这就是要与他共度一生的女人。她恨他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What difference did it make? They were laughing at him all the same. The only person in the Red Keep who didn't seem to find his marriage a source of amusement was his lady wife.</div>

<div class="line_en">And their nights together in the great bed were another source of torment. He could no longer bear to sleep naked, as had been his custom. His wife was too well trained ever to say an unkind word, but the revulsion in her eyes whenever she looked on his body was more than he could bear. Tyrion had commanded Sansa to wear a sleeping shift as well. I want her, he realized. I want Winterfell, yes, but I want her as well, child or woman or whatever she is. I want to comfort her. I want to hear her laugh. I want her to come to me willingly, to bring me her joys and her sorrows and her lust. His mouth twisted in a bitter smile. Yes, and I want to be tall as Jaime and as strong as Ser Gregor the Mountain too, for all the bloody good it does.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同床的夜晚是痛苦之源。提利昂习惯裸睡，而今却无法忍受。他的夫人被训练得很娴淑，从不说半句顶撞的话，但每当她看到他的身体，那种目光简直让人无地自容。于是他嘱咐她穿上睡袍。我想要她，他心想，是的，我也想要临冬城，但最想要的还是她，管她孩子还是女人。我想给她安慰，我想听她欢笑，我想她开开心心地和我在一起，我想她把欢乐、痛苦、悲伤和欲望与我分享。想到这里，他苦涩地笑了。是啊，我好希望自己如詹姆一般高大，像魔山一样强壮。诸神慈悲！">查看中文翻译</div>

Tyrion had not wanted her to hear the news from any lips but his own, so he had commanded Varys to bring her to him the night before his wedding.

<div class="line_en">Muddy Way was crowded, but soldiers and townfolk alike made way for the Imp and his escort. Hollow-eyed children swarmed underfoot, some looking up in silent appeal whilst others begged noisily. Tyrion pulled a big fistful of coppers from his purse and tossed them in the air, and the children went running for them, shoving and shouting. The lucky ones might be able to buy a heel of stale bread tonight. He had never seen markets so crowded, and for all the food the Tyrells were bringing in, prices remained shockingly high. Six coppers for a melon, a silver stag for a bushel of corn, a dragon for a side of beef or six skinny piglets. Yet there seemed no lack of buyers. Gaunt men and haggard women crowded around every wagon and stall, while others even more ragged looked on sullenly from the mouths of alleys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="烂泥道上人潮汹涌，但在金袍子的驱赶下，兵士和平民都为小恶魔的队伍让道。眼窝深陷的儿童群聚在旁，有的沉默呆望，有的放声乞讨。提利昂从钱包里取出一大把铜板，抛掷出去，孩子们旋即展开争夺，互相叫喊推挤。他们中的幸运儿大概今晚能吃上一块霉面包。市集广场从未有过如此拥挤，提利尔家已运来无数补给，但食物的价格仍高得离谱。六个铜板买一个南瓜，一个银鹿换一堆玉米，一枚金龙的价值则是一刀牛肉或六只骨瘦如柴的猪崽。虽然如此，买家依旧络绎不绝。形容憔悴枯槁的男女围满每一辆马车、每一个货摊，而那些凄惨无助的人则站在巷子口，阴郁地观看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned away from Aegon's High Hill, into the maze of smaller streets that clustered around the foot of Visenya's. Bronn led the way. Once or twice Tyrion glanced back over his shoulder to see if they were being followed, but there was nothing to be seen except the usual rabble: a carter beating his horse, an old woman throwing nightsoil from her window, two little boys fighting with sticks, three gold cloaks escorting a captive… they all looked innocent, but any one of them could be his undoing. Varys had informers everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们离开伊耿高丘，朝维桑妮亚丘陵底部那堆由弯曲小巷组成的迷宫走去。波隆当先领路，提利昂不时回头，查看是否有眼线跟踪，但没发现什么异常情况：只有一个驱策马车的货郎，一个在窗边倒夜壶的老太婆，两个用木棍打闹的小孩，三名押送俘虏的金袍子…他们看起来都很无辜，但他却不放心。八爪蜘蛛瓦里斯可不是那么好欺瞒的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They turned at a corner, and again at the next, and rode slowly through a crowd of women at a well. Bronn led him along a curving wynd, through an alley, under a broken archway. They cut through the rubble where a house had burned and walked their horses up a shallow flight of stone steps. The buildings were close and poor. Brorm halted at the mouth of a crooked alley, too narrow for two to ride abreast. "There's two jags and then a dead end. The sink is in the cellar of the last building."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩转过一个拐角，接着是另一个，然后缓缓骑过一群妇女。波隆带他在弯曲的窄巷里穿梭，走了很长一段，经过破碎的拱门。马蹄“得得”地踏过石阶梯，阶梯上有一具战斗中烧焦的马尸。这里的建筑又矮又挤，待波隆在一小巷口停下，前方的路已不容两人并骑。“前面转两个弯到头，那家伙就在最后一栋房子的地窖里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The back room was even darker. A flickering candle burned on a low table, beside a flagon of wine. The man behind it scarce looked a danger; a short man -- though all men were tall to Tyrion -- with thinning brown hair, pink cheeks, and a little pot pushing at the bone buttons of his doeskin jerkin. In his soft hands he held a twelve-stringed woodharp more deadly than a longsword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后面的房间更黑，只在矮桌上有根摇曳的蜡烛，旁边是一壶酒。桌边的男人十分猥亵，他很矮——所谓的“矮”并非针对提利昂而言——稀梳的棕发，粉红的脸颊，扣上骨扣的鹿皮夹克也遮掩不住他的大肚子。他用柔软的双手死死握着一把十二弦木竖琴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wine sink was a dismal place, dark and damp, walls pale with niter, the ceiling so low that Bronn would have had to duck to keep from hitting his head on the beams.

She handed him a cup of sour wine and said, "In the back."</div>

You wouldn't want to deny anyone the joy of hearing you sing. A year in each should suffice." He reached inside his cloak, to where the gold was hidden.

But blended into the folds was a red as deep as the grey. The two colors lapped over one another without ever touching, each ripple distinct, like waves of night and blood upon some steely shore.

These old swords remember, it is said, and they do not change easily. I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again, but always the color would darken, as if the blade was drinking the sun from it. And some folds would not take the red at all, as you can see. if my lords of Lannister are displeased, I will of course try again, as many times as you should require, but --"</div>
