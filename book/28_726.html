<div class="line_en">People ask what it's like to live in the White House. I sometimes say that it's a bit like what I imagine living in a fancy hotel might be like, only the fancy hotel has no other guests in it -- just you and your family. There are fresh flowers everywhere, with new ones brought in almost every day. The building itself feels old and a little intimidating. The walls are so thick and the planking on the floors so solid that sound in the residence seems to get absorbed quickly. The windows are grand and tall and also fitted with bomb-resistant glass, kept shut at all times for security reasons, which further adds to the stillness. The place is kept immaculately clean. There's a staff made up of ushers, chefs, housekeepers, florists, and also electricians, painters, and plumbers, everyone coming and going politely and quietly, doing their best to keep a low profile, waiting until you've moved out of a room before slipping in to change the towels or put a fresh gardenia in the little vase at the side of your bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I understood how lucky we were to be living this way. The master suite in the residence was bigger than the entirety of the upstairs apartment my family had shared when I was growing up on Euclid Avenue. There was a Monet painting hanging outside my bedroom door and a bronze Degas sculpture in our dining room. I was a child of the South Side, now raising daughters who slept in rooms designed by a high-end interior decorator and who could custom order their breakfast from a chef.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我明白，能够像现在这样生活有多么幸运。主套房比我小时候我们家在欧几里得大道居住的整个公寓还要大。我和贝拉克的卧室门外悬挂着一幅克劳德·莫奈的画作，餐厅里还摆放着一幅埃德加·德加的铜质雕塑作品。我自己小时候的生活环境是芝加哥南城，而当时，我的两个女儿却住在由顶尖室内设计师设计的屋子里，她们甚至可以跟厨师定制自己喜欢的早餐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rooms are big, all of them. Even the bathrooms and closets are built on a scale different from anything I'd ever encountered. Barack and I were surprised by how much furniture we had to pick out in order to make each room feel homey. Our bedroom had not just a king-sized bed -- a beautiful four-poster with a wheat-colored cloth canopy overhead -- but also a fireplace and a sitting area, with a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of upholstered chairs. There were five bathrooms for the five of us living in the residence, plus another ten spare bathrooms to go with them. I had not just a closet but a spacious dressing room adjoining it -- the same room from which Laura Bush had shown me the Rose Garden view. Over time, this became my de facto private office, the place where I could sit quietly and read, work, or watch TV, dressed in a T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, blessedly out of sight of everyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白宫所有的房间面积都很大，就连浴室和储物间的建筑规模也都是我所见过的最大的，以至于贝拉克和我都吃惊地表示，我们究竟需要挑选多少件家具摆进去，才能让每个房间都有家的感觉。我和贝拉克的房间不仅有一张特大双人床—床体有四根美丽的帷柱，头顶是一顶小麦色的床幔，而且有一个可以取暖的壁炉，一个可以休闲聊天的地方，有一张沙发、一张咖啡桌，还有几把带软垫的椅子。我们一家五口人，每人都有一间浴室，除此以外还有十间浴室空置。我自己有一间衣橱，紧邻衣橱还有一间十分宽敞的更衣室—就是之前劳拉·布什带我参观时，通过窗户向我展示白宫玫瑰园风景的那间屋子。只是当时，这里确确实实已经成为我的私人空间，我可以只穿一件T恤，一条运动裤，远离大家的视线，静静地坐在这里享受属于自己的时光，办公、看书或者看电视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth was that in all of this the girls and I were supporting players, beneficiaries of the various luxuries afforded to Barack -- important because our happiness was tied to his; protected for one reason, which was that if our safety was compromised, so too would be his ability to think clearly and lead the nation. The White House, one learns, operates with the express purpose of optimizing the well-being, efficiency, and overall power of one person -- and that's the president. Barack was now surrounded by people whose job was to treat him like a precious gem. It sometimes felt like a throwback to some lost era, when a household revolved solely around the man's needs, and it was the opposite of what I wanted our daughters to think was normal. Barack, too, was uncomfortable with the attention, though he had little control over all the fuss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，之所以能拥有这一切，是因为我和两个女儿是贝拉克的“队友”，当然，也是他所得到的各式各样奢侈服务的受益者。我们之所以重要，是因为他的幸福很大程度上取决于我和两个孩子是否幸福；我们必须得到保护的理由也只有一个，那就是如果自己家人的安全都受到威胁，那么他也无法保证大脑清晰和领导国家的能力。大家都知道，白宫运作的一个核心目标就是将“一个人”的幸福指数、工作效率以及个人能力最大化，这个人就是美国总统。贝拉克身边所有人的职责都是：将他当作一块珍贵的宝石一样伺候着。有时候，这种感觉就像是大倒退回到了那迷失的年代一样，一个家庭里所有人的工作都是围着一个男人的需求打转，他就是核心。我希望我们的女儿能够意识到，这是一种非正常的状态，相反，一个家庭中每个人都能得到尊重、得到发展才是一种正常的逻辑。其实，对贝拉克自己来说，这种受到“过分关注”“小题大做”的待遇也让他感到很不自在，但是，他束手无策。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried, in my way, to loosen the protocol of the place. I made it clear to the housekeeping staff that our girls, as they had in Chicago, would make their own beds every morning. I also instructed Malia and Sasha to act as they'd always acted -- to be polite and gracious and to not ask for anything more than what they absolutely needed or couldn't get for themselves. But it was important to me, too, that our daughters feel released from some of the ingrown formalities of the place. Yes, you can throw balls in the hallway, I told them. Yes, you can rummage through the pantry looking for snacks. I made sure they knew they didn't have to ask permission to go outside and play. I was heartened one afternoon during a snowstorm when I caught sight of the two of them through the window, sledding on the slope of the South Lawn, using plastic trays lent to them by the kitchen staff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，我也尝试以自己的方式去适当减少白宫的条条框框。我明明白白地告诉房间服务员，两个女儿还是跟以前住在芝加哥的时候一样，每天早晨起床后自己收拾被褥。我也明确要求玛利亚和萨沙一如既往，以前怎样，现在也要怎样—要待人有礼貌，要懂得宽容；如果不是她们真正需要的东西，就不能随意索要；只要是她们能够自己做的事情，就不能使唤别人去做。同时，我们的两个女儿是否能不受白宫某些繁文缛节的限制，这一点对我来说也很重要。我告诉她们：“是的，你们可以在走廊里扔皮球。”“没错，你们可以去食品储存室里翻找你们想吃的东西。”我还特意告诉她们，如果她们想到楼外面去玩耍，直接去就好了，不必征求我的意见。一天下午，正下着雪，我从窗户往外看，发现她们两个正在南草坪的斜坡上，用从厨师那里借来的塑料托盘滑雪。这一幕顿时让我感到非常欣慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As long as I've known him, Barack has never derived pleasure from shopping, cooking, or home maintenance of any kind. He's not someone who keeps power tools in the basement or shakes off work stress by making a risotto or trimming hedges. For him, the removal of all obligations and worries concerning the home made him nothing but happy, if only because it freed his brain, allowing it to roam unfettered over larger concerns, of which there were many.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从我和贝拉克认识以来，他就一直不喜欢购物、做饭，以及做任何形式的家庭维修。他不是那种会在地下室备有电动工具的人，或者那种通过下厨做一顿意大利烩饭、修剪整理家里的树篱来缓解工作压力的人。对他来说，如果能不承担任何家务、不用为任何家庭琐事操心，那就是一件幸福的事，因为这样他就不用分心，可以留出精力去天马行空地思考一些更重要的事情，当然，这样的重要事情有很多很多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He now had about fifty staffers reading and answering his mail. He had Marine helicopter pilots standing by to fly him anywhere he needed to go, and a six-person team that organized thick briefing books so he could stay current on the issues and make educated decisions. He had a crew of chefs looking after his nutrition, and a handful of grocery shoppers who safeguarded us from any sort of food sabotage by making anonymous runs to different stores, picking up supplies without ever revealing whom they worked for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他身边大约有五十名工作人员，专门帮他接收、回复日常邮件；有专门的海军陆战队直升机飞行员，随时准备带他飞往任何他需要去的地方；还有一个六人小组，专门负责整理各类简报，以确保他能够随时跟进事态的发展，从而做出有根据的、正确的决策。他有一帮厨师，专门负责他的营养问题；还有一批专门的采购人员，负责保证我们的食品安全，他们会匿名去不同的商场，挑选购买我们需要的物品，但从不透露他们为谁服务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most amusing to me was the fact that he now had three personal military valets whose duties included standing watch over his closet, making sure his shoes were shined, his shirts pressed, his gym clothes always fresh and folded. Life in the White House was very different from life in the Hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让我感到最有趣的是，他现在还有三名贴身随从，他们的职责包括：查看他的衣橱，确保他的皮鞋擦得锃亮，衬衣熨烫得平整，健身服及时洗干净、晾干并折叠摆放整齐。白宫的生活与普通人的生活真的是大相径庭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当时，他也开始按时吃饭了，这简直就是一项额外的福利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his first month in office, Barack signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which helped protect workers from wage discrimination based on factors like gender, race, or age. He ordered the end of the use of torture in interrogations and began an effort (ultimately unsuccessful) to close the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay within a year. He overhauled ethics rules governing White House employees' interactions with lobbyists and, most important, managed to push a major economic stimulus bill through Congress, even though not a single House Republican voted in its favor. From where I sat, he seemed to be on a roll. The change he'd promised was becoming real.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正式就任美国总统后的第一个月，贝拉克就签署了《莉莉·莱德贝特公平薪酬法》，以保护劳动者不会因为性别、种族、年龄而在工资上受到歧视。他还下令审讯时不得使用逼供手段，并试图努力在一年内关闭位于古巴的关塔那摩湾的关塔那摩监狱，可惜最终未能实现。他修订了白宫雇员与说客来往的相关职业道德准则。最重要的是，在众议院共和党无一人支持的情况下，他成功在国会通过了一项重大经济激励方案。在我看来，他几乎连连获胜，他竞选时许下的承诺也开始一项一项地兑现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see how neat I am now?" Barack said to me one day as we sat at breakfast, his eyes mirthful. "Have you looked in my closet?"</div>

<div class="line_en">For me and the girls, this was the startling, happy shift that came from living in the White House with the president of the United States as opposed to living in Chicago with a father who served in some faraway senate and was often out campaigning for higher office. We had access, at long last, to Dad. His life was more orderly now. He worked a ridiculous number of hours, as he always had, but at 6:30 p. m. sharp he'd get on the elevator and ride upstairs to have a family meal, even if he often had to go right back down to the Oval Office afterward. My mother sometimes joined us for dinner, too, though she'd fallen into her own sort of routine, coming down to say hello before accompanying Malia and Sasha to school but mostly choosing to leave us in the evenings, instead eating dinner upstairs in the solarium adjacent to her bedroom while Jeopardy! was on. Even when we asked her to stay, she'd usually wave us off. "You all need your time," she'd say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我和两个女儿来说，这是一个让我们倍感吃惊而又拍手称快的转变。以前，在芝加哥的时候，孩子们的父亲在距离我们家有段距离的伊利诺伊州的议会供职，还经常在外竞选，以升入更高的职位，所以我们一家人很少能在一起吃饭。然而当时，虽然我们住在白宫，孩子们的父亲也成了美国总统，我们一家人却可以经常一起用餐，孩子们也总算能经常见到爸爸了。总之，贝拉克的生活比过去规律了很多，尽管他的工作时间还是跟过去一样非常长，但是下午六点半，他会准时乘坐电梯上楼，回家跟我们共进晚餐，不过，晚饭后，他经常需要马上回到他那椭圆形办公室继续处理公务。有时候，我母亲也会和我们一起吃晚饭，不过大多数时候，她都有自己的生活安排。她通常早上下楼跟我们打招呼，然后陪着玛利亚和萨沙去上学，到了晚上，她很少跟我们待在一起，而是自己在楼上那间紧邻她卧室的日光浴室里，一边看《危险边缘》 [1]一边吃晚饭。即使我们挽留她跟我们一起，她通常也都边挥手再见边说：“你们也都需要一点儿自己的时间。”【注：[1] 《危险边缘》（Jeopardy），美国著名的电视智力竞赛节目。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first few months in the White House, I felt the need to be watchful over everything. One of my earliest lessons was that it could be relatively costly to live there. While we stayed rent-free in the residence and had our utilities and staffing paid for, we nonetheless covered all other living expenses, which seemed to add up quickly, especially given the fancy-hotel quality of everything. We got an itemized bill each month for every food item and roll of toilet paper. We paid for every guest who came for an overnight stay or joined us for a meal. And with a culinary staff that had Michelin-level standards and a deep eagerness to please the president, I had to keep an eye on what got served. When Barack offhandedly remarked that he liked the taste of some exotic fruit at breakfast or the sushi on his dinner plate, the kitchen staff took note and put them into regular rotation on the menu. Only later, inspecting the bill, would we realize that some of these items were being flown in at great expense from overseas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚搬进白宫的前几个月里，我感觉事事都需要我亲自留心。我最早总结出的一条经验就是：在白宫生活成本会相对较高。虽然我们不用为住所支付租金，不用交水电费，也不用为工作人员支付工资，但是，我们要自己承担其他所有的生活开支，这笔花销可真不小，尤其是这里的一切都是高档酒店级别的，支出更是迅速增加。我们每月都会收到一个账单，上面列有我们购买的所有食物以及日用品，哪怕是一卷卫生纸。如果有客人来访，在白宫住上一晚或者跟我们一起吃顿饭，我们也要为其买单。加之我们还有一名米其林大厨级别的厨师，他又非常想讨好总统，因此，我就得留意他到底给贝拉克上了什么高级菜。有时候，贝拉克会随口说一句，早餐时某种外国水果的味道不错，或者晚饭时的寿司很好吃，厨师就会马上记录下来，把它们列在菜单上，定期轮换。后来，直到我们查看账单的时候才发现，其中一些食物是专门从国外运输过来的，价格非常昂贵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was allowed to use a personal BlackBerry but had been advised to limit my contacts to only about ten of my most intimate friends -- the people who loved and supported me without any sort of agenda. Most of my communications were mediated by Melissa, who was now my deputy chief of staff and knew the contours of my life better than anyone. She kept track of all my cousins, all my college friends. We gave out her phone number and email address instead of mine, directing all requests to her. Part of the issue was that old acquaintances and distant relatives were surfacing from nowhere and with a flood of inquiries. Could Barack speak at somebody's graduation? Could I please give a speech for somebody's nonprofit? Would we come to this party or that fund-raiser? Most of it was good-hearted, but it was too much for me to absorb all at once.</div>

<div class="line_en">When it came to the day-to-day lives of our girls, I often had to rely on young staffers to help with logistics. My team met early on with teachers and administrators at Sidwell, recording important dates for school events, ironing out processes for media inquiries, and answering questions from teachers about handling classroom topics involving politics or news of the day. As the girls began making social plans outside school, my personal assistant (or "body person," as it's called in political parlance) became the point of contact, collecting the phone numbers of other parents, orchestrating pickups and drop-offs for playdates. Just as I always had in Chicago, I made a point of trying to get to know the parents of the girls' new friends, inviting a few moms over for lunch and introducing myself to others during school events. Admittedly, these interactions could be awkward. I knew it sometimes took a minute for new acquaintances to move past whatever ideas they held about me and Barack, whatever they thought they knew of me from TV or the news, and to see me simply, if possible, as Malia's or Sasha's mom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到两个女儿的日常生活，我经常需要一些年轻员工的帮助，请他们帮我做一些后勤保障类的工作。早些时候，我团队中的职员就去拜访了塞维尔友谊学校的老师以及管理人员，记录了学校举办一些重大活动的日期，协商取消了媒体问询环节，并解答了老师提出的一些问题，比如，当课堂上涉及政治和当天的新闻话题时，应该如何把控、处理。当两个孩子开始安排她们的校外社交活动时，我的私人助理成为她们的中间联络人，收集其他孩子父母的电话号码，精心策划并安排孩子们的接送问题。和过去在芝加哥的时候一样，每当两个孩子交到了新朋友，我总是会想办法尽量去结识对方的父母，邀请几位母亲一起吃午饭；赶上学校举办活动的时候，我还会主动向其他孩子的父母作自我介绍。坦白说，这种与人交往的方式可能会让人觉得比较尴尬。我知道，有时候，让刚刚认识我的人抛开他们对我和贝拉克已有的看法，抛开他们以为自己了解的那个我—从电视里或者新闻里面了解的我，只单纯将我看作是玛利亚和萨沙的母亲，得花上一定的工夫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ilearned early on that I was meant to work with my staff to plan and execute a series of traditional parties and dinners, beginning most immediately with the Governors' Ball, a black-tie gala held every February in the East Room. The same went for the annual Easter Egg Roll, an outdoor family celebration that had been started in 1878 and involved thousands of people. There were also springtime luncheons I would attend in honor of congressional and Senate spouses -- similar to the one where I'd seen Laura Bush smiling so unflappably while having an official photo taken with every single guest.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was awkward to explain to people that before Sasha could come to little Julia's birthday party, the Secret Service would need to stop by and do a security sweep. It was awkward to require Social Security numbers from any parent or caregiver who was going to drive a kid over to our house to play. It was all awkward, but it was all necessary. I didn't like that there was this strange little divide to be crossed anytime I met someone new, but I was relieved to see that it was far different for Sasha and Malia, who went dashing outside to greet their school friends as they got dropped off at the Diplomatic Reception Room -- or Dip Room, as we came to call it -- grabbing them by the hand and running giggling inside. Kids care about fame, it turns out, for only a few minutes. After that, they just want to have fun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令人感到尴尬的事情还有很多，比如：在萨沙去参加小茱莉亚的生日聚会之前，特工处的特工需要先去彻底做一遍安全检查；当其他孩子的父母或者其他监护人送他们的孩子来我们家跟两个孩子玩耍时，他们必须提前报上自己的社会安全号码。所有这些都让人感到尴尬不已，但是又都非常必要。我不喜欢每次认识新的朋友时，都要先越过这样一个奇怪的、小小的障碍。但是，当我看到萨沙和玛利亚对这些事情表现得完全不在乎时，我感到异常欣慰。每当她们的朋友来白宫做客，在外交接待大厅门口刚一下车，她们就会迫不及待地飞奔过去迎接，然后拉着朋友的手，一起咯咯笑着跑回屋里。事实证明，孩子们对于名望的关注只有几分钟，过了这几分钟，她们只想高高兴兴、开开心心地玩耍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, these social events could feel like distractions from what I hoped would be more impactful work, but I also started thinking about ways I might add to or at least modernize some of them, to bend the bar of tradition ever so slightly. In general, I was thinking that life in the White House could be forward leaning without losing any of its established history and tradition. Over time, Barack and I would take steps in this direction, hanging more abstract art and works by African American artists on the walls, for example, and mixing contemporary furniture in with the antiques. In the Oval Office, Barack swapped out a bust of Winston Churchill and replaced it with a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. And we gave the tuxedoed White House butlers the option of dressing more casually on days when there were no public events, introducing a khaki and golf shirt option.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说，这些社交活动与我所希望从事的更有影响力的工作相去甚远，但是，我也开始思考是不是可以给这些活动增加一些新东西，或者至少打破其中一些传统，融入一些现代元素。总的来说，我认为白宫里的生活可以更加前卫，但又不会减损白宫的深厚历史与传统。随着时间的推移，我和贝拉克之间达成共识—要朝着这个方向努力，比如，我们在白宫的墙上挂上了一些非洲裔美国艺术家创作的比较抽象的作品；增添了一些款式更为现代的家具，与白宫中的古董混搭。贝拉克还撤掉了他办公室里原来摆放的温斯顿·丘吉尔的半身像，换上了马丁·路德·金的半身像。在白宫不举办公共活动的时候，我们对管家们的穿着也不做要求，他们可以选择穿得更随意一些，比如可以穿卡其裤配高尔夫球衫，而不用整日里穿无尾礼服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack and I knew we wanted to do a better job of democratizing the White House, making it feel less elitist and more open. When we hosted an event, I wanted everyday people to show up, not just those accustomed to black-tie attire. And I wanted more kids around, because kids made everything better. I hoped to make the Easter Egg Roll accessible to more people -- adding more slots for city schoolchildren and military families to go with the tickets guaranteed to the children and grandchildren of members of Congress and other VIPs. Lastly, if I was going to sit and lunch with the (mostly) wives of the House and the Senate, couldn't I also invite them to join me out in the city for a community service project?</div>

<div class="line_en">I was not a gardener and never had been in my life, but thanks to Sam Kass and our family's efforts to eat better at home, I now knew that strawberries were at their most succulent in June, that darker-leaf lettuces had the most nutrients, and that it wasn't so hard to make kale chips in the oven. I saw my daughters eating things like spring pea salad and cauliflower mac and cheese and understood that until recently most of what we knew about food had come through food-industry advertising of everything boxed, frozen, or otherwise processed for convenience, whether it was in snap-crackle TV jingles or clever packaging aimed at the harried parent dashing through the grocery store. Nobody, really, was out there advertising the fresh, healthy stuff -- the gratifying crunch of a fresh carrot or the unparalleled sweetness of a tomato plucked right off the vine.</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was more to it than that. I planned to use the work we did in the garden to spark a public conversation about nutrition, especially at schools and among parents, which ideally would lead to discussions about how food was produced, labeled, and marketed and the ways that was affecting public health. And in speaking on these topics from the White House, I'd be offering an implicit challenge to the behemoth corporations in the food and beverage industry and the way they'd been doing business for decades.</div>

<div class="line_en">Planting a garden at the White House was my response to this problem, and I hoped it would signal the start of something bigger. Barack's administration was focused on improving access to affordable health care, and for me the garden was a way to offer a parallel message about healthy living. I saw it as an early test, a trial run that could help me determine what I might be able to accomplish as First Lady, a literal way to root myself in this new job. I conceived of it as a kind of outdoor classroom, a place kids could visit to learn about growing food. On the surface, a garden felt elemental and apolitical, a harmless and innocent undertaking by a lady with a spade -- pleasing to Barack's West Wing advisers who were constantly concerned about "optics," worrying about how everything appeared to the public.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正因为如此，我才决定开垦白宫花园用来种植果蔬。我希望我的这一行动能够释放出一种信号，预示着将来能有更大的、更有意义的行动。贝拉克的新政府此时正在全力推动医疗改革，旨在让全美国人人都能看得起病，而我开垦白宫花园种菜的做法正好与之相呼应，向人们传递一种健康的生活理念。我将其看作一个用以试手的项目，它可以帮我下定决心，以第一夫人的身份去做我有可能做成的事，这也是我让自己扎根于第一夫人这份职业的一种实实在在的途径。我也将其看作一种户外教学课堂，孩子们可以前来参观，学习如何种植作物。从表面看来，花园只是大自然的一部分，与政治扯不上什么关系，我拿起铲子开垦花园只不过是一种单纯无害的天真的行为—或许对于贝拉克在白宫西翼的政策顾问们来说，这倒是一件好事，因为他们一直都非常关心“视觉效果”，在意公众对每一件事情的看法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My optimism in those first months was primarily tempered by one thing, and that was politics. We lived in Washington now, right up close to the ugly red-versus-blue dynamic I'd tried for years to avoid, even as Barack had chosen to work inside it. Now that he was president, these forces all but ruled his every day. Weeks earlier, before the inauguration, the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh baldly announced, "I hope Obama fails." I'd watched with dismay as Republicans in Congress followed suit, fighting Barack's every effort to stanch the economic crisis, refusing to support measures that would cut taxes and save or create millions of jobs. On the day he took office, according to some indicators, the American economy was collapsing as fast as or faster than it had at the onset of the Great Depression. Nearly 750,000 jobs had been lost that January alone. And while Barack had campaigned on the idea that it was possible to build consensus between parties, that Americans were at heart more united than divided, the Republican Party was making a deliberate effort, in a time of dire national emergency no less, to prove him wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初几个月里，我对开垦白宫花园一直非常乐观，但这种乐观情绪最终被一件事冲淡，那就是政治。我们生活在华盛顿，几乎处在丑恶的“红蓝之争” [2]的核心区。这么多年来，我一直尽量避开党派之争，即使在贝拉克决定代表民主党参加竞选之后，依然如此。然而，即使贝拉克已经当选为美国总统，他身边的党派之争也一天都没有间断过。几周以前，在贝拉克还没正式就任的时候，保守电台主持人拉什·林堡就直截了当地称：“我希望奥巴马输掉。”当国会议员中的共和党人也跟他一样开始反对贝拉克时，我感到异常沮丧。对于贝拉克提出的任何缓解经济危机的措施，他们都表示反对；贝拉克提出通过减税来帮助美国工人保住饭碗，并可以赢得上百万个工作机会，他们也拒绝支持。一些经济指标显示，贝拉克就职当天，美国经济下行的速度与20世纪30年代大萧条初期经济下行的速度基本相同，甚至还要更快，仅在1月，全美国就失去了将近75万个工作岗位。贝拉克竞选时一直秉持这样一个理念：共和党和民主党之间的分歧可以弥合，所有美国人内心都希望团结而非分裂。但与此同时，在整个国家面临可怕的危机时，共和党成员却蓄意去证明贝拉克的判断是错误的。【注：[2]美国媒体习惯使用红色指代共和党，以蓝色指代民主党，美国两党政治之争因此被称为“红蓝之争”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I took my seat that evening in the balcony between a fourteen-year-old who'd written a heartfelt letter to her president and a gracious veteran of the Iraq war, all of us waiting for my husband to arrive. From where I sat, I could see most of the chamber below. It was an unusual, bird's-eye view of our country's leaders, an ocean of whiteness and maleness dressed in dark suits. The absence of diversity was glaring -- honestly, it was embarrassing -- for a modern, multicultural country. It was most dramatic among the Republicans. At the time, there were just seven nonwhite Republicans in Congress -- none of them African American and only one was a woman. Overall, four out of five members of Congress were male.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was on my mind during the evening of February 24, when Barack addressed a joint session of Congress. The event is basically meant to be a substitute State of the Union for any newly inaugurated president, a chance to outline the goals for the coming year in a speech televised live during prime time, delivered in the hall of the House of Representatives with Supreme Court justices, cabinet members, military generals, and members of Congress present. It's also a tradition of high pageantry, in which lawmakers dramatically express their approval or disapproval of the president's ideas by either leaping to their feet in repeat standing ovations or remaining seated and sullen.</div>

I'd go over to play at the Gore sisters' house and envy their space -- the fact that their family had a whole house to themselves. I thought that it would mean something if my family could afford a nicer car. I couldn't help but notice who among my friends had more bracelets or Barbies than I did, or who got to buy their clothes at the mall instead of having a mom who sewed everything on the cheap using Butterick patterns at home.

<div class="line_en">We lived in the White House now. Very slowly, it was starting to feel familiar -- not because I'd ever grow accustomed to the vastness of the space or the opulence of the lifestyle, but because this was where my family slept, ate, laughed, and lived. In the girls' rooms we'd put on display the growing collections of trinkets that Barack made a habit of bringing home from his various travels -- snow globes for Sasha, key chains for Malia. We began to make subtle changes to the residence, adding modern lighting to go with the traditional chandeliers and scented candles that made the place feel more like home.

<div class="line_en">Even my mother, who'd fretted about the museum-like formality of the White House, soon learned that there was more there to be measured. The place was full of people not all that different from us. A number of the butlers had worked for many years in the White House, tending to every family that came through. Their quiet dignity reminded me of my great-uncle Terry, who'd lived downstairs when I was growing up on Euclid Avenue, mowing our lawn dressed in wingtips and suspenders. I tried to make sure that our interactions with staff were respectful and affirming. I wanted to make sure they never felt invisible. If the butlers cared about politics, if they had private allegiances to one party or another, they kept it to themselves. They were careful to respect our privacy, but also were always open and welcoming, and gradually we became close. They instinctively sensed when to give me some space or when I could stand some gentle ribbing. Often they were talking trash about their favorite sports teams in the kitchen, where they liked to fill me in on the latest staff gossip or the exploits of their grandchildren as I looked over the morning headlines. If there was a college basketball game playing on the TV in the evening, Barack came in sometimes to join them for a little while to watch. Sasha and Malia came to love the convivial spirit of the kitchen, slipping in to make smoothies or pop popcorn after school. Many of the staff took a special shine to my mother, stopping in to catch up with her upstairs in the solarium.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the first international trip Barack and I made together since the election, flying to London on Air Force One so that he could attend a meeting of the Group of 20, or G20, made up of leaders representing the world's largest economies. It was a critical moment for such a gathering. The economic crisis in the United States had created devastating ripples across the globe, sending world financial markets into a tailspin. The G20 summit also marked Barack's debut as president on the world stage. And as was often the case during those first months in office, his main job was to clean up a mess, in this case absorbing the frustration of other world leaders who felt the United States had missed important opportunities to regulate reckless bankers and prevent the disaster with which all of them were now dealing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gordon Brown, Britain's prime minister, was hosting the G20 summit, which included a full day of economic meetings at a conference center in the city, but as often happened when world leaders showed up in London for official events, the Queen would also have everyone over to Buckingham Palace for a ceremonial hello. Because of America and Great Britain's close relationship and also, I suppose, because we were new on the scene, Barack and I were invited to arrive at the palace early for a private audience with the Queen ahead of the larger reception.</div>

<div class="line_en">It turns out that Buckingham Palace is big -- so big that it almost defies description. It has 775 rooms and is fifteen times the size of the White House. In the years to come, Barack and I would be lucky enough to return there a few times as invited guests. On our later trips, we'd sleep in a sumptuous bedroom suite on the ground floor of the palace, looked after by liveried footmen and ladies-in-waiting. We'd attend a formal banquet in the ballroom, eating with forks and knives coated in gold. At one point, as we were given a tour, we were told things like "This is our Blue Room," our guide gesturing into a vast hall that was five times the size of our Blue Room back home. The Queen's head usher one day would take me, my mother, and the girls through the palace Rose Garden, which contained thousands of flawlessly blooming flowers and occupied nearly an acre of land, making the few rosebushes we so proudly kept outside the Oval Office suddenly seem a tad less impressive. I found Buckingham Palace breathtaking and incomprehensible at the same time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我那时才发现，白金汉宫实在是太大了，以至于根本无法用言语来形容。这座宫殿一共有七百七十五间屋子，面积足足有白宫的15倍大。让我感到幸运的是，在之后的几年里，我和贝拉克还曾多次应邀访问这座宫殿。在后面的几次拜访中，我们还曾在这里留宿，我们当时住的是宫殿一层一间非常华丽的套房，有专门的、穿着制服的男侍从和女侍从照顾我们的起居。我们也曾在这里的舞厅参加正式的宴会，当时用餐的刀叉外表都镀着黄金。我们还在接待员的引领下游览了整座宫殿，当时，我们走到一处，接待员介绍说“这是宫殿的蓝厅”，然后示意我们进去看看。我发现，蓝厅非常宽敞，面积足足是我们白宫蓝厅的五倍大。有一天，女王的首席接待员带着我、我母亲还有两个女儿参观了这里的玫瑰园，整个园子占地面积将近1英亩 [4]，园里盛开着成千上万朵漂亮的花，美极了。这样一对比，我突然觉得白宫总统办公室外那几丛我们一直引以为豪的玫瑰瞬间逊色了许多。我深深觉得，女王的白金汉宫真是美得令人惊叹，美得不可思议。【注：[4] 1英亩约为4046平方米。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Needless to say, I had no experience meeting royalty. I was given to understand that I could either curtsy or shake the Queen's hand. I knew that we were to refer to her as "Your Majesty," while her husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, went by "Your Royal Highness." Other than that, I wasn't sure what to expect as our motorcade rolled through the tall iron gates at the entrance to the palace, past onlookers pressed at the fences, past a collection of guards and a royal horn player, through an interior arch and up to the courtyard, where the official master of the household waited outside to greet us.</div>

<div class="line_en">On that first visit, we were escorted to the Queen's private apartment and shown into a sitting room where she and Prince Philip stood waiting to receive us. Queen Elizabeth II was eighty-two years old then, diminutive and graceful with a delicate smile and her white hair curled regally away from her forehead. She wore a pale pink dress and a set of pearls and kept a black purse draped properly over one arm. We shook hands and posed for a photo. The Queen politely inquired about our jet lag and invited us to sit down. I don't remember exactly what we talked about after that -- a little bit about the economy and the state of affairs in England, the various meetings Barack had been having.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次到访时，我们径直被带到了女王的私人公寓，并被引领着进到一间会客厅，女王和菲利普亲王正在那儿等着接待我们。当时，女王伊丽莎白二世八十二岁，头发花白，身形小巧，面带微笑，举止优雅，额头上方的头发向后挽起，看上去显得非常庄重。她穿着一件淡粉色的连衣裙，戴着全套的珍珠首饰，还搭配了一款黑色的手提包，手提包挎在胳膊上，位置刚刚合适。我们首先握手寒暄，然后一起合了影。女王彬彬有礼地询问我们是否还有时差反应，并请我们入座。关于之后的聊天内容，我现在已经记得不是很清楚了，好像有一点是关于当时的经济形势，还有英格兰的事态以及贝拉克当时参加的各种会议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's an awkwardness that comes with just about any formally arranged meeting, but in my experience it's something you need to consciously work your way past. Sitting with the Queen, I had to will myself out of my own head -- to stop processing the splendor of the setting and the paralysis I felt coming face-to-face with an honest-to-goodness icon. I'd seen Her Majesty's face dozens of times before, in history books, on television, and on currency, but here she was in the flesh, looking at me intently and asking questions. She was warm and personable, and I tried to be the same. The Queen was a living symbol and well practiced at managing it, but she was as human as the rest of us. I liked her immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这次与女王会面的过程中，我感觉有些紧张。其实我觉得，任何正式会面，都可能会有一些不自在的感觉，我的经验是，遇到这种情况，还是可以有意识地设法调整自己的心态的。当时，我虽然坐着和女王聊天，但始终有点心不在焉，满脑子都是白金汉宫的豪华，以及与这样一位真诚善良的面对面时所产生的那种无力感。我努力让自己不要胡思乱想。此前，不论是从历史书上、电视上，还是从英国的货币上，我已经见过女王陛下的容颜几十次了，但此时此刻，我眼前的这位女王却是活生生的，她热情地看着我，并向我提出各种各样的问题。她举手投足都让人觉得温暖、优雅。我也尽力表现，想让自己变得和她一样。在我看来，伊丽莎白二世女王陛下现在已经成为一种象征，而且她已经完全掌握了如何驾驭这一身份。但是，她同时也和我们其他所有人一样—首先是一个人。我很快就喜欢上了这位女王陛下。">查看中文翻译</div>

I did my best to remember who came from which nation and which spouse went with whom, careful not to say too much for fear of getting anything wrong.

<div class="line_en">I couldn't have known it in the moment, but I was committing what would be deemed an epic faux pas.

"Michelle Obama Dares to Hug the Queen!" It revived some of the campaign-era speculation that I was generally uncouth and lacking the standard elegance of a First Lady, and worried me somewhat, too, thinking I'd possibly distracted from Barack's efforts abroad. But I tried not to let the criticism rattle me. If I hadn't done the proper thing at Buckingham Palace, I had at least done the human thing. I daresay that the Queen was okay with it, too, because when I touched her, she only pulled closer, resting a gloved hand lightly on the small of my back.</div>

<div class="line_en">The following day, while Barack went off for a marathon session of meetings on the economy, I went to visit a school for girls. It was a government-funded, inner-city secondary school in the Islington neighborhood, not far from a set of council estates, which is what public-housing projects are called in England. More than 90 percent of the school's nine hundred students were black or from an ethnic minority; a fifth of them were the children of immigrants or asylum seekers. I was drawn to it because it was a diverse school with limited financial resources and yet had been deemed academically outstanding. I also wanted to make sure that when I visited a new place as First Lady, I really visited it -- meaning that I'd have a chance to meet the people who actually lived there, not just those who governed them. Traveling abroad, I had opportunities that Barack didn't. I could escape the stage-managed multilateral meetings and sit-downs with leaders and find new ways to bring a little extra warmth to those otherwise staid visits. I aimed to do it with every foreign trip, beginning in England.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wasn't fully prepared, though, to feel what I did when I set foot inside the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School and was ushered to an auditorium where about two hundred students had gathered to watch some of their peers perform and then hear me speak. The school was named after a pioneering doctor who also became the first female mayor elected in England. The building itself was nothing special -- a boxy brick building on a nondescript street. But as I settled into a folding chair onstage and started watching the performance -- which included a Shakespeare scene, a modern dance, and a chorus singing a beautiful rendition of a Whitney Houston song -- something inside me began to quake.

Looking up at the girls, I just began to talk, explaining that though I had come from far away, carrying this strange title of First Lady of the United States, I was more like them than they knew. That I, too, was from a working-class neighborhood, raised by a family of modest means and loving spirit, that I'd realized early on that school was where I could start defining myself -- that an education was a thing worth working for, that it would help spring them forward in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="演出结束后，当我走上台开始演讲的时候，我几乎无法控制自己激动的心情，我低头看了一眼早已准备好的提纲，但是，就在那一瞬间，我对提纲完全失去了兴趣。我抬头看台下的孩子们，开始即兴演讲。我告诉她们，虽然我从很远的地方来，并且是带着美国第一夫人这样一个奇怪的头衔，但是，有一点她们不知道，我其实有很多地方跟她们相似：我告诉他们，我也来自一个工人阶层社区，从小生活在一个经济并不富裕但是充满爱的家庭里；我告诉她们，我很早就意识到，学校是一个可以定义自己人生的地方—争取接受更多的教育是一件值得去努力的事情，因为教育能帮助我们走向更远的未来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this point, I'd been First Lady for just over two months. In different moments, I'd felt overwhelmed by the pace, unworthy of the glamour, anxious about our children, and uncertain of my purpose. There are pieces of public life, of giving up one's privacy to become a walking, talking symbol of a nation, that can seem specifically designed to strip away part of your identity. But here, finally, speaking to those girls, I felt something completely different and pure -- an alignment of my old self with this new role. Are you good enough? Yes, you are, all of you. I told the students of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson that they'd touched my heart. I told them that they were precious, because they truly were. And when my talk was over, I did what was instinctive. I hugged absolutely every single girl I could reach.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back home in Washington, spring had arrived. The sun came up earlier and stayed out a little longer each day. I watched as the slope of the South Lawn gradually turned a lush and vibrant green. From the windows of the residence, I could see the red tulips and lavender grape hyacinth that surrounded the fountain at the base of the hill. My staff and I had spent the past two months working to turn my idea for a garden into reality, which hadn't been easy. For one thing, we'd had to persuade the National Park Service and the White House grounds team to tear up a patch of one of the most iconic lawns in the world. The very suggestion had been met with resistance, initially. It had been decades since a White House Victory Garden had been planted, on Eleanor Roosevelt's watch, and no one seemed much interested in a reprise. "They think we're insane," Sam Kass told me at one point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们回到华盛顿的时候已经是春天了。与往日相比，太阳升起得更早了一些，落山的时间则更晚了一些。我眼看着南草坪斜坡上的绿色逐渐加深，直到最后变成一片翠绿。从我们住所的窗户向外看，山脚下银光闪闪的喷泉周围，满是大红色的郁金香和淡紫色的葡萄风信子。在过去两个月里，我和我的团队共同努力，终于将我的想法变成了现实，完成了对白宫花园的开垦，这说起来是一件非常不容易的事情。首先，我们必须要说服美国国家公园管理局以及白宫土地管理处，请他们同意我们开垦南草坪的一小部分，要知道，这可是全世界最著名、最具标志性的草坪之一！我们的这一提议起初的确遭到了反对，毕竟，距离第二次世界大战期间时任第一夫人安娜·埃莉诺·罗斯福在白宫开辟“胜利花园”已经有几十年了，后来似乎并没有人想去效仿这一做法。“他们觉得我们是疯了。”萨姆有一次告诉我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eventually, though, we got our way. We were at first allotted a tiny plot of land tucked away behind the tennis courts, next to a toolshed. To his credit, Sam fought for better real estate, finally securing an L-shaped eleven-hundred-square-foot plot in a sun-splashed part of the South Lawn, not far from the Oval Office and the swing set we'd recently installed for the girls. We coordinated with the Secret Service to make sure our tilling wouldn't disrupt any of the sensors or sight lines they needed to protect the grounds. We ran tests to determine whether the soil had enough nutrients and didn't contain any toxic elements like lead or mercury.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我们最终还是成功了。刚开始只有一块小小的、隐藏在网球场后边、紧挨着工具房的土地被分配给我们。值得赞扬的是，萨姆最终为我们努力争取到了更好的土地—南草坪上一块1100平方英尺的L形土地，这里距离总统办公室以及我们最近给两个孩子安装的秋千都不算远，并且几乎整日洒满阳光。我们又跟特工处协调，以确保我们的耕种活动不会干扰到他们的信号感测器以及照准线等安全保卫措施。我们还专门进行了试验，以测试土地营养是否充足，是否含有任何有毒成分，比如铅、汞等重金属。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several days after I returned from Europe, I hosted a group of students from Bancroft Elementary School, a bilingual school in the northwestern part of the city. Weeks earlier, we'd used shovels and hoes to prepare the soil. Now the same kids were back to help me do the planting. Our patch of dirt sat not far from the southern fence along E Street, where tourists often congregated to gaze up at the White House. I was glad that this would now be a part of their view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从欧洲回来几天以后邀请了班克罗夫特小学的孩子们来白宫。班克罗夫特小学是一所双语学校，位于华盛顿的西北部。几周之前，我们曾用铲子、锄头给菜园松了土，现在同一批孩子又回来帮我栽培作物。还有一点，我们的菜园子距离顺着E大街的那道白宫南铁栅栏并不是很远，游客经常会聚集在这里隔着栅栏观赏白宫，我很高兴从此以后这里能成为他们观赏的一道风景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then we were good to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切准备就绪，只等开始了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or at least I hoped to be glad at some point. Because with a garden you never know for sure what will or won't happen -- whether anything, in fact, will grow. We'd invited the media to cover the planting. We'd invited all the White House chefs to help us, along with Tom Vilsack, Barack's secretary of agriculture. We'd asked everyone to watch what we were doing. Now we had to wait for the results. "Honestly," I'd said to Sam before anyone arrived that morning, "this better work."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少，我希望它能让我在某些时候感到高兴，因为对于这个菜园子，你永远不能确定接下来什么会发生、什么不会发生—这里能长出东西吗？我们邀请媒体对种植过程进行报道，邀请白宫所有的厨师前来帮忙，还邀请贝拉克的农业部部长汤姆·维尔萨克到场。所有人都见证了我们的劳动过程，然后，我们只能静待结果了。那天早上，在所有人还未到来之前，我就跟萨姆说：“说实话，我希望我们所做的这一切都不会白费。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That day, I knelt with a bunch of fifth graders as we carefully put seedlings into the ground, patting the dirt into place around the fragile stalks. After being in Europe and having my every outfit dissected in the press (I'd worn a cardigan sweater to meet the Queen, which was almost as scandalous as touching her had been), I was relieved to be kneeling in the dirt in a light jacket and a pair of casual pants. The kids asked me questions, some about vegetables and the tasks at hand, but also things like "Where's the president?" and "How come he's not helping?" It took only a little while, though, before most of them seemed to lose track of me, their focus centered instead on the fit of their garden gloves and the worms in the soil. I loved being with children. It was, and would be throughout the entirety of my time in the White House, a balm for my spirit, a way to momentarily escape my First Lady worries, my self-consciousness about constantly being judged. Kids made me feel like myself again. To them, I wasn't a spectacle. I was just a nice, kinda-tall lady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，我和一群五年级的孩子们一起跪在地上，小心翼翼地将幼苗一棵棵放进刨好的坑里，然后在幼苗四周盖上土，再轻轻拍打结实。在刚刚结束的欧洲之旅期间，我的每一套服装都会被媒体大加评论、大肆报道，比如，我与英国女王见面时穿了一件开襟衫，这被认为是一件失礼而又丢人的事情，就跟我犯了禁忌碰触了女王一样。如今，穿一件轻便的外套、一条休闲裤，并跪在土地上种植蔬菜，对我来说简直就是一种解脱。孩子们向我问问题，一些是关于蔬菜以及我们手头上的工作的，也有一些其他的问题，比如：“总统去哪里了？”“他怎么不来帮忙呢？”然而，还没一小会儿，他们中大部分人就已经把我抛在脑后。他们的注意力已经转移到了其他地方，比如，他们的园艺手套戴起来是不是刚好合适，又比如，他们在泥土里面发现了虫子。我喜欢跟孩子们待在一起，孩子们是我的精神慰藉，他们能够帮助我从第一夫人的种种忧虑中暂时逃离，甚至不去在乎别人对我的种种评价。从前如此，在我以后在白宫的生活中亦是如此。在孩子们面前，我能够重新做回我自己。对他们来说，我也不是一道值得猎奇的风景，只是一位和蔼的、个头儿稍微有点高的女士而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the morning went on, we planted lettuce and spinach, fennel and broccoli. We put in carrots and collard greens and onions and shell peas. We planted berry bushes and a lot of herbs. What would come from it? I didn't know, the same way I didn't know what lay ahead for us in the White House, nor what lay ahead for the country or for any of these sweet children surrounding me. All we could do then was put our faith into the effort, trusting that with sun and rain and time, something half-decent would push up through the dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天上午，随着时间一点一点过去，我们分批种植了莴苣、菠菜、茴香、花椰菜，胡萝卜、羽衣甘蓝、洋葱、豌豆，浆果丛以及很多草药。将来能有收获吗？我不知道。同样，我也不知道将来我们在白宫还会面临什么，不知道美国将来会面临什么，也不知道我身边这些可爱的孩子们将来会是什么样子。当时，我们所有能做的事情就是：心怀信念，努力劳动，把余下的都交给阳光、雨露和时间，假以时日，一定会有一些像样的东西破土而出。">查看中文翻译</div>
