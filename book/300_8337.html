<div class="line_en">UNDER the appellation of Roger Chillingworth, the reader will remember, was hidden another name, which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken. It has been related, how, in the crowd that witnessed Hester Prynne's ignominious exposure, stood a man, elderly, travel-worn, who, just emerging from the perilous wilderness, beheld the woman, in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home, set up as a type of sin before the people. Her matronly fame was trodden under all men's feet. Infamy was babbling around her in the public market-place. For her kindred, should the tidings ever reach them, and for the companions of her unspotted life, there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonour; which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship. Then why -- since the choice was with himself -- should the individual, whose connection with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all, come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable? He resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame. Unknown to all but Hester Prynne, and possessing the lock and key of her silence, he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind, and as regarded his former ties and interests, to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean, whither rumour had long ago consigned him. This purpose once effected, new interests would immediately spring up, and likewise a new purpose; dark, it is true, if not guilty, but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such was the young clergyman's condition, and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished, all untimely, when Roger Chillingworth made his advent to the town. His first entry on the scene, few people could tell whence, dropping down, it were, out of the sky, or starting from the nether earth, had an aspect of mystery, which was easily heightened to the miraculous. He was now known to be a man of skill; it was observed that he gathered herbs, and the blossoms of wild-flowers, and dug up roots, and plucked off twigs from the forest-trees like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was valueless to common eyes. He was heard to speak of Sir Kenelm Digby, and other famous men -- whose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernatural -- as having been his correspondents or associates. Why, with such rank in the learned world, had he come hither? What could he, whose sphere was in great cities, be seeking in the wilderness? In answer to this query, a rumour gained ground -- and, however absurd, was entertained by some very sensible people -- that Heaven had wrought an absolute miracle, by transporting an eminent Doctor of Physic, from a German university, bodily through the air, and setting him down at the door of Mr. Dimmesdale's study! Individuals of wiser faith, indeed, who knew that Heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stage-effect of what is called miraculous interposition, were inclined to see a providential hand in Roger Chillingworth's so opportune arrival.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位青年牧师的身体就是这种状况，当罗杰·齐灵渥斯初到镇上的时候，情况已经相当危险，这年轻人的曙光眼见就要过早地殒灭了。齐灵渥斯首次登场时，谁也说不出所以然，简直象是从天而降或从地狱钻出，这就具有一种神秘色彩，从而很容易被夸大成奇迹。如今无人不晓他是一名医生！人们注意到他采集药草、摘取野花、挖掘植根，还从树上折取细校，常人眼中的无用之物，他似是熟知其隐含的价值。人们听到他提起坎奈姆·狄戈比爵士和其他名人——他们的科学造诣简直被视作超自然的，但他却说是他的笔友或熟人。他既然在学术界地位如此之高，为什么要到这里来呢？他的天地理应在大城市，在这蛮荒野地中又能寻找到什么呢？为了回答这些疑问，于是就有了谣言的土壤，不管一些风传多么离奇，也为一些明智的人所接受：说是上天创造了一个绝对的奇迹，把一位著名的医学博士，从一所德意志大学里，凭空摄到了丁梅斯代尔先生书斋的门前。而一些具有更加聪慧的信仰的人明知，上天为实现其目的，不必求助于所谓奇迹的插曲来达到舞台效果，但也乐于看到罗杰·齐灵握斯是假上天之手才及时到来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But how could the young minister say so, when, with every successive Sabbath, his cheek was paler and thinner, and his voice more tremulous than before -- when it had now become a constant habit, rather than a casual gesture, to press his hand over his heart? Was he weary of his labours? Did he wish to die? These questions were solemnly propounded to Mr. Dimmesdale by the elder ministers of Boston and the deacons of his church, who, to use their own phrase, "dealt with him" on the sin of rejecting the aid which Providence so manifestly held out. He listened in silence, and finally promised to confer with the physician.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这位年轻牧师怎么能这样讲呢？一个接一个安息日，他的面颊越来越苍白消瘦，他的声音也比先前更加颤抖，而且他用手捂心口的动作，已经从漫不经心的姿态变成时时都有的习惯了。是他厌倦了他的工作吗？是他想死吗？丁梅斯代尔先生一路受到波土顿的长老们如此的盘诘和他教堂中的执事们的——用他们自己的话说——“规劝”：上天如此明显地伸出救援之手，拒绝是有罪的。他默默不语地听着，终于答应和医生谈谈看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好心的人从来都是把自己说得十分卑微的，”医生说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah," replied Roger Chillingworth, with that quietness which, whether imposed or natural, marked all his deportment, "it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak. Youthful men, not having taken a deep root, give up their hold of life so easily! And saintly men, who walk with God on earth, would fain be away, to walk with Him on the golden pavements of the New Jerusalem."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay," rejoined the young minister, putting his hand to his heart, with a flush of pain flitting over his brow, "were I worthier to walk there, I could be better content to toil here."</div>

<div class="line_en">In this manner, the mysterious old Roger Chillingworth became the medical adviser of the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. As not only the disease interested the physician, but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient, these two men, so different in age, came gradually to spend much time together. For the sake of the minister's health, and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them, they took long walks on the sea-shore, or in the forest; mingling various talk with the plash and murmur of the waves, and the solemn wind-anthem among the tree-tops. Often, likewise, one was the guest of the other, in his place of study and retirement. There was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science, in whom he recognised an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope; together with a range and freedom of ideas, that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession. In truth, he was startled, if not shocked, to find this attribute in the physician. Mr. Dimmesdale was a true priest, a true religionist, with the reverential sentiment largely developed, and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed, and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time. In no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views; it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him, supporting, while it confined him within its iron framework. Not the less, however, though with a tremulous enjoyment, did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse. It was as if a window were thrown open, admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study, where his life was wasting itself away, amid lamplight, or obstructed day-beams, and the musty fragrance, be it sensual or moral, that exhales from books. But the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort. So the minister, and the physician with him, withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，神秘的老罗杰·齐灵渥斯成了丁梅斯代尔牧师先生的健康顾问。这位医生不仅对疾病感到兴趣，而且还对他的病人的个性和品质严加窥测。这两个人虽然在年纪上相差悬殊，但逐渐共同消磨超更多的时间了。为了牧师的健康，而且也使医生能够收集具有奇效的植物，他俩在海滨、林间长时间散步，聆听海浪的低语与林涛的戾鸣。同样，他俩也时常到彼此的书斋和卧室中去作客。对牧师来说，这位科学家的陪伴中自有一种魅力，因为从他身上可以看出广博精深的知识修养，以及浩渺无际的自由观念——这在自己的同行中是万难找到的。事实上，他在医生身上发现了这些特色，即使没有引起震惊，也足以深感诧异。丁梅斯代尔先生是一个地道的牧师，一个真正的笃信宗教的人，他有高度发展的虔诚的感情和有力地推动着自身沿着信仰的道路前进的心境，而且会随着时间的流逝面日渐深入。无论在何种社会形态中，他都不会是那种所谓有自由见解的人；他总要感到周国有一种信仰的压力，才能心平气和，这信仰既支撑着他，又将他禁闭在其铁笼之中。然而当他放弃惯常采用的认识而换用另一种知识媒介来观察字宙时，他也确实感到一种偶然的舒畅，尽管这种喜悦之中仍带着几分震颤。犹如打开了一扇窗户，使一种更自由的气息得以进入那闭锁和窒人的书斋，而他通常就在这里的灯光或遮着的阳光之下，伴着从经书中散发出来的霉烂气味——不管是感官上还是道德上的，消耗看他的生命。但这破窗而入的空气又过于清冷，使他无法坦然地长久吸取。于是，牧师和陪伴他的医生只好再龟缩到他们的教会划为正宗的禁区之内。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow, of good social rank, who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of King's Chapel has since been built. It had the graveyard, originally Isaac Johnson's home-field, on one side, and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections, suited to their respective employments, in both minister and man of physic. The motherly care of the good widow assigned to Mr. Dimmesdale a front apartment, with a sunny exposure, and heavy window-curtains, to create a noon-tide shadow, when desirable. The walls were hung round with tapestry, said to be from the Gobelin looms, and, at all events, representing the Scriptural story of David and Bathsheba, and Nathan the Prophet, in colours still unfaded, but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woe-denouncing seer. Here, the pale clergyman piled up his library, rich with parchment-bound folios of the Fathers, and the lore of Rabbis, and monkish erudition, of which the Protestant divines, even while they vilified and decried that class of writers, were yet constrained often to avail themselves. On the other side of the house, old Roger Chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory; not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete, but provided with a distilling apparatus, and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals, which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose. With such commodiousness of situation, these two learned persons sat themselves down, each in his own domain, yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other, and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one another's business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两位朋友的新居属于一个虔信宗教的寡妇，她有着不错的社会地位，她这所住宅所占的地皮离后来修建的王家教堂相距不远，一边有一块墓地，就是原先艾萨克·约翰逊的旧宅，这里易于唤起严肃认真的回忆，很适合牧师和医生双方各自的职业。那好心肠的寡妇，以慈母般的关怀，分配丁梅斯代尔先生住在前室，那里有充分的阳光，还有厚实的窗帘，如果愿意的话，中午也可把房间遮得十分幽暗。四壁悬挂着据说是戈白林织机上织出的织锦，不管真假，上面确实绣着《圣经》上面所记载的大卫、拔示巴和预言者拿单的故事，颜色尚未褪掉，可惜画中的美妇简直如那宣告灾难的预言者一样面目可憎了。面色苍白的牧师在这里摞起他的丰富藏书，其中有对开桑皮纸精装本的先哲们的著作、拉比们记下的传说、以及许多僧院的考证——对这类文献，请教教士们尽管竭力诋毁，却不得不备作不时之需。在住宅的另一侧，老罗杰·齐灵渥斯布置下他的书斋和实验室；在一位现代科学家看来，连勉强齐备都称不上，但总还有一个蒸馏釜及一些配药和化验的设备，都是这位惯于实验的炼丹术士深知如何加以利用的。有了这样宽敞的环境，这两位学者便在各自的房间里坐了下来，不过经常不拘礼节地互访，彼此怀着好奇心观察另一个人的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Roger Chillingworth possessed all, or most, of the attributes above enumerated. Nevertheless, time went on; a kind of intimacy, as we have said, grew up between these two cultivated minds, which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study, to meet upon; they discussed every topic of ethics and religion, of public affairs, and private character; they talked much, on both sides, of matters that seemed personal to themselves; and yet no secret, such as the physician fancied must exist there, ever stole out of the minister's consciousness into his companion's ear. The latter had his suspicions, indeed, that even the nature of Mr. Dimmesdale's bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him. It was a strange reserve!</div>

<div class="line_en">To sum up the matter, it grew to be a widely diffused opinion, that the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale, like many other personages of especial sanctity, in all ages of the Christian world, was haunted either by Satan himself, or Satan's emissary, in the guise of old Roger Chillingworth. This diabolical agent had the Divine permission, for a season, to burrow into the clergyman's intimacy, and plot against his soul. No sensible man, it was confessed, could doubt on which side the victory would turn. The people looked, with an unshaken hope, to see the minister come forth out of the conflict, transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win. Meanwhile, nevertheless, it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph.</div>
