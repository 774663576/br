<div class="line_en">"Wait, stop! Where the hell are we going?" Dylan huffed to a standstill and cemented her feet to the ground, folding her arms across her chest. She'd been blindly following him, but they had been marching for twenty minutes in total silence now, going in who knew which direction and he hadn't said a word since the curt, "Come with me." All of the questions, all reasons for staying at the tunnel mouth that had inexplicably vanished from her head when he'd ordered her to follow had returned, now with full force. Walking randomly like this was just stupid.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?!" Dylan's voice rose an octave with incredulity. "We've just come out of a train crash where everybody else seems to have disappeared.

<div class="line_en">Dylan frowned for a moment, confused by the strange question, before launching into her argument once more. "Well, the police for one. My parents." Dylan felt a little thrill at being able to say that in the plural for the first time. "When the train doesn't arrive at the next station, do you not think the train company might wonder where it is?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦皱了皱眉，被这个奇怪的问题弄糊涂了，然后她便将自己的想法一股脑地说了出来：“比如说，警察吧，还有我父母。”第一次可以把父母亲合在一起说，迪伦心中微微有些激动，“火车没有到达下一站，你以为铁路公司会不想知道它的去向吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She raised her eyebrows here, secretly pleased with the strength of her line of reasoning, and waited for him to respond.</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked over to Dylan and ducked down slightly so that he could look into her eyes, shocking blue into startled green. His closeness made her a little uncomfortable, but she stood her ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到迪伦身边，微微弯下身子，好直视她的眼睛。他靠得太近了，这让她有点不自在，但她仍然原地未动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed. It was almost a musical sound, but underpinned with a hint of mockery. His reaction confounded and infuriated her again. Dylan pursed her lips, waiting for the punchline, but it didn't come. Instead he smiled. It changed his entire face, warming his natural coldness. But there was still something not quite right about it. It looked sincere, but it didn't stretch to his eyes. They remained icy and aloof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笑了，笑声悦耳动听，但基调却是淡淡的嘲讽。他的反应让她既感到困惑又觉得愤怒。迪伦噘着嘴，等着他说出什么妙语来，但他只是笑笑而已，却不点明到底哪儿好笑。他笑起来时竟像换了一张脸，天生的一副冷面上也带了暖意，不过总有什么地方不对劲。他的笑发自肺腑，但笑意却没有传到眼睛上，那双眼依旧冰冷孤傲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，”他观察着她的表情，恬然一笑，“转过身，你还能再找到那条隧道吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I told you you weren't where you thought you were, what would you say?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是我告诉你，你并不在你自以为在的地方，你又会怎么说？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" Dylan was totally confused, and not a little bit intimidated. He was maddening with his arrogance, making fun of her at every turn and coming out with nonsense statements like that. What could be the point of his question except to bamboozle her and make her doubt herself?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”迪伦完全糊涂了，也吓坏了。他一直态度傲慢，让人抓狂。他动不动就挖苦她，时不时还要冒出几句此类没头没脑的话。他这个问题除了糊弄她，让她自己怀疑自己外还有什么别的意义吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan looked over her shoulder. The landscape was empty and unfamiliar. Everything looked the same. Stark, windswept hills as far as the eye could see, dipping down into gullied valleys where vegetation grew voraciously, soaking up the moisture and revelling in the shelter from the constant gales. There was no sign of the tunnel entrance or even the train tracks. That was weird; they hadn't gone very far. She felt a tightening in her chest as she realised that she had no idea what direction they had come from, that she would be completely lost if Tristan left her now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦回头望去，眼前的风景既空旷又陌生，所有的东西看起来都一模一样。触目所及只有风中的濯濯童山，山下沟壑纵横，到处是恣肆生长的植被，它们饱吸露水，乐得有大山替它们遮挡无休无止的狂风。隧道入口甚至连铁轨都无影无踪。怪了！他们并没有走多远。她意识到自己根本分辨不清他们来时的方向了，如果崔斯坦现在离开她的话，她就完全迷路了。一想到这些，她的胸口一阵发紧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you even know where you're going?" she panted as she hurried to keep up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要往哪儿走你总该知道吧？”她气喘吁吁地说，脚下还在拼命跟上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan laughed as he watched the realisation trickle across her face. She was at his mercy now.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="又是得意扬扬的一笑，让人气恼，“知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How?" Matching his pace was reducing her to one syllable questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么知道的？”她要跟上他的脚步，只能把问题精简。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because I've been here before," he replied. He seemed supremely confident, and had taken control of the situation -- and of her -- completely. Though she hated to admit it, unless she wanted to wander helplessly around on her own, she had little option but to trust him. He continued to storm up the hill and Dylan's legs, unused to exercise, were already burning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为我以前去过那儿。”他回答道。他似乎非常自信，一切尽在他的掌握之中，也包括她在内。尽管她讨厌承认这一点，但除非她想无依无靠地一个人在这儿流浪，除了欣然接受他之外别无选择。他还在继续大步向山上冲，而迪伦久不运动的双腿已经开始火辣辣地疼起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then I guess you're stuck with me." He grinned wickedly and began marching again. Dylan stood motionless, torn, but as the distance began to open up between them, her feet seemed to act of their own accord, afraid of being left alone. She scrambled over a small cluster of boulders and jogged through some short grass until she had bridged the gap. He continued to stride out, his long legs and loping gait allowing him to outstrip her easily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜你现在甩不掉我了。”他咧开嘴一声坏笑，然后又开始赶路了。迪伦站在那里一动也不动，心里还在纠结。但随着他们之间的距离越拉越大，她的脚像是害怕落单似的，不受她支配地自己动了起来。她爬上一小堆岩石，慢步穿过一片低矮的草地，最后终于赶了上来。他还在大步流星地往前走，两条长腿和大步幅让他能轻轻松松超过她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She also imagined her dad waiting at the train station for her. Maybe he'd think she hadn't wanted to come, that she'd chickened out. That would be awful. No, he knew which train she was on. He'd hear that the train had crashed, or got stuck, or whatever had happened. Still, she needed to let him know that she was okay. She supposed by the time all of this got sorted out it would be too late to head up to Aberdeen this weekend. Hopefully he would be willing to buy her another ticket. Although really the train company should give me one for free at least, she thought. Joan would be even less willing to let her go after this, though. Maybe he could come down to Glasgow instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也想到了父亲正在火车站等她。或许他会认为她不愿意来了，事到临头退缩了。要是那样就糟了。不，他知道自己坐哪趟车。他会听说火车出了事故，或者是动弹不了了等等诸如此类的事。但她需要让他知道自己现在没事。她觉得，等这场事故处理完了再去阿伯丁就太迟了。她希望父亲能再给她买张火车票，不过她觉得铁路公司至少应该给她一张免费的车票。但琼肯定不愿意放她再出一趟远门了。也许他会来格拉斯哥看她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“附近有城镇之类的什么地方吗？有手机能通话的地方吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, sorry," he said, and despite his frostiness he seemed it. He slowed to a more moderate speed. Dylan gratefully matched his pace and continued her questioning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，抱歉。”他说。尽管冷若冰霜，但他似乎真的感到了歉意，把速度降到了适中。心存感激的迪伦赶了上来，于是继续提问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan bit her lip, concerned. The later it got, the more worried she knew her mum would be. One of the conditions of Joan allowing her to make the trip had been that she would call as soon as she arrived and met her dad. She wasn't sure how much time had passed -- she'd been unconscious for a bit on the train -- but she was sure that Joan would be expecting her to get in touch soon. If she phoned Dylan's mobile and got the answerphone, she'd start to worry.</div>

<div class="line_en">She gazed around her, hunting for signs of civilisation. Tristan was right, though: nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她四处张望，试图搜寻文明的一点痕迹。但崔斯坦说得一点没错，四周什么都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then something else made her pause. If there was no town nearby and it was already late afternoon, what were they going to do once it got dark?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是接下来她转念一想，不由得停下了脚步。如果附近没有城镇，现在天色也接近黄昏了，一旦天黑下来，他们又该怎么办呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You said you'd been here before," she began. By now they had traipsed to the top of the hill and were going down a particularly sheer section of the other side, so Dylan kept her eyes on the ground, watching every step. If she had been looking at Tristan's face she would have seen the wary, cautious look that came into his eyes. "When was that, exactly?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说你以前来过这儿？”她又开始发问了。此时他们刚刚拖着疲惫的脚步走到山顶，正在从另一侧非常陡峭的山坡向下行进，所以迪伦一直注视着地面，紧盯着每一步。如果她此前一直在观察崔斯坦表情的话，她就能看到他的目光一下子变得机警而谨慎了，“那是什么时候的事了？具体什么时候？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan was stung into silence. She turned away from him, looked up at the sky where the clouds were painted steely grey and darkening with each passing minute. So that was it, Tristan realised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦被他刺得好一会儿说不出话。她转过身，抬头看着天空，望着青灰色的云。云层的颜色随着时间一分一秒的流逝变得越来越阴沉。崔斯坦明白了，“原来是这么回事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So many questions, so early on. It seemed an ominous sign to Tristan. He tried to lighten the mood by laughing, but Dylan drew her mouth into a grimace and this time she really did look at him. He rearranged his features into a more convincing expression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一大堆的问题，这才刚刚开始呢。对崔斯坦来说，这是个不祥之兆。他尽力想通过微笑让心情放轻松，但迪伦拉着脸愁眉不展，这次她真的是直勾勾地盯着他。他调整了一下自己的面部表情，做出一副不容置辩的样子来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan made a face. She had no experience of camping, but was fairly sure that any activity which involved sleeping outdoors with no access to a kitchen, bathroom or warm bed was not for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦做了个鬼脸。她没有野营的经历，但她很清楚，只要在外面过夜没有厨房做饭，没有浴室洗澡，也没有温暖的床睡觉，那她一定会觉得难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Afraid of the dark?" he asked. She wrinkled her nose, ignoring him. "Look," he said, taking control, "it's going to take longer than this light will last to get where we're going. We're going to have to rough it I'm afraid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怕黑吗？”他问。迪伦皱着鼻子不理他。“看。”崔斯坦采取主动又开了口，“我们还没到目的地，天早就黑了。恐怕今天晚上只能凑合在野外过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rolled his eyes, arrogant and patronising again. "It's way too late to do that! We'd end up wandering around in the pitch black. I know a sheltered spot. We'll survive. You've been through worse today," he added.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oddly, Dylan hadn't thought much about the train crash. Once she'd got out of the tunnel, Tristan had assumed control so thoroughly that she had simply followed his lead. Added to that, it had all been over so fast that she wasn't really sure what had actually happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，迪伦一直没有过多地去想这次事故。她刚从隧道里出来，崔斯坦就完全掌控了全局，她只是跟着他，听他指挥。而且，一切都来得太快了，她都没闹明白到底发生了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"See that?" he asked, pulling Dylan from her thoughts and pointing to a ruined cottage about half a mile away, nestled in a narrow valley at the bottom of the hill. It looked long abandoned, with a tumbledown stone wall outlining the boundary. The roof had several large holes in it, the door and windows were long gone and it seemed as if another ten years might finish off the crumbling walls. She nodded mutely, and he continued. "That'll keep the cold and wind out a bit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看到了吗？”崔斯坦把迪伦从自己的思绪中拉了回来。他指着大约半英里外一处破败的简陋窝棚，小屋紧挨着山底一条狭长的山谷，看起来荒废已久，一面石墙摇摇欲坠，大致确定出屋子的边界。屋顶有几处大洞，门窗也已不知去向。看起来，只要再有个十年左右的时间，这几面正在剥落的老墙也将荡然无存。她木然地点了点头。他又接着说：“这房子御寒挡风还是能起很大作用的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, we won't." Tristan's voice dripped with scorn. "It's barely raining at all. It'll probably stop soon, and it's much more sheltered down there."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan led the way in, righting a table and chair, and upturning a bucket for him to sit on. He gestured to Dylan that she should take the chair. She sat gingerly, thinking it might collapse under her weight. It held firm, but she couldn't relax. Without the howling wind there was a very awkward silence. Added to that, now she no longer had the walk across perilous terrain to keep her occupied. There was nothing to do but sit and try not to stare at Tristan. She felt incredibly ill at ease, trapped inside the cottage with a virtual stranger. On the other hand, the day's trauma was beginning to sink in, and she was desperate to talk about what had happened. She eyed Tristan, wondering how to break the silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦先进了屋，把桌椅扶正，把一个水桶倒扣过来坐在上面，又示意迪伦坐在椅子上。她小心翼翼地坐下，生怕自己一压椅子就垮了。椅子倒还坚固，但她还是不敢放松。听不到狂风呼啸的声音，屋里沉默的气氛愈加尴尬。而且她不用再手忙脚乱地走过那些危险的山路了，所以现在无事可干，只能枯坐在那里，尽量不去看崔斯坦。和一个完全陌生的人困在这么一间陋室里，她别提有多不自在了。可另一方面，此时回味白天受的苦，她又急切地想找个人聊聊刚发生的事故。她看着崔斯坦，不知道如何才能打破沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Close up, the cottage did not look any more attractive. The garden had attempted to reassert itself as wilderness, and they had to fight their way through thistles, brambles and tufts of thick grass just to get through the front door. Once they were inside, things improved slightly. Even without the windows or door, the wind was cut considerably, and the roof at one end was almost completely intact. Even if it rained during the night, they had a reasonable chance of staying dry. The place looked like it had been ransacked, though. The previous owner had left various possessions and a few rickety bits of furniture, but almost everything was broken and strewn carelessly across the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走近了再看，小屋并没有变好看一点。花园已经开始重新归于荒芜。他们从前门走进去，费力地穿过蓟、荆棘和茂密的荒草丛。到了屋子里，情况略有改善。虽然没有门窗，风势却减了不少，而另一端的屋顶几乎完好无损。即使晚上下雨，那一半屋顶也能让他们不至于被淋湿。虽然这间屋子像是早就被搬空了，但以前的房主还是留下了许多物品和几件行将散架的家具。但几乎所有的东西都残破不堪，凌乱地堆在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shrugged again, standoffish and disinterested. "Same as yours I suppose." His eyes flitted away and Dylan could see he was uncomfortable. How could he not want to talk about this? She couldn't understand it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又耸了耸肩，一副爱答不理、事不关己的样子，“我想跟你们那儿情况一样吧。”他的神色飘忽，迪伦看得出他有些不自在。他怎么可能不想谈这些呢？迪伦实在理解不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why were you there?" He looked up sharply at that, startled, and Dylan quickly elaborated. "What I mean is, where were you going on the train? To visit someone?" Suddenly she wished she hadn't asked. Something had flashed in his eyes that she didn't like, a defensiveness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当时你为什么在那儿呢？”听到这话，他猛然抬头，像受了惊吓似的。迪伦赶紧解释：“我的意思是，你是在哪儿上的车？要去看谁？”话一出口迪伦就后悔了。他的眼神中闪现出戒备之色，迪伦可不喜欢这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was visiting," he said. "My aunt lives up there." His tone was final, shutting down the conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是去看人，”他说，“我姑妈住在那儿。”他的语气像是在下结论，没办法聊下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan drummed her fingers on the tabletop as she considered him. Visiting an aunt seemed innocent enough, but she wondered if it was something more sinister. Why else would he be so mysterious, so shifty? Was she isolated in the middle of nowhere with some sort of criminal? Or was she just being silly -- paranoid after the shock of the day?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦在桌面上敲着手指，一边敲一边琢磨这个人。看望姑妈似乎是光明正大，但她怀疑这背后是不是有什么罪恶勾当。这人神神秘秘的，老叫人捉摸不透，除了搞阴谋诡计外还有什么别的解释吗？她现在孤零零地待在这片荒野，和她共处一室的人是不是名罪犯啊？也许她是吓昏了头了—这些只是她受惊吓后的偏执妄想？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What will we do for food?" she asked, more to change the subject than anything else, because his aloofness was unnerving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们怎么吃饭呢？”她这样问主要是想换个话题，因为他的高傲太让人紧张不安了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you hungry?" He sounded a bit taken aback.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你饿了吗？”他的声音听起来有点吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan thought about it and found, to her surprise, that the answer was no. She had last eaten after school on the way to the train station. A hurried hamburger from a greasy café choked down with a warm Diet Coke. That had been hours ago. Although skinny, she ate like a horse. Joan always joked that she'd wake up one day and be twenty stone. Normally she would have expected to be ravenous. Maybe loss of appetite was a symptom of shock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦仔细想了想，吃惊地发现自己竟然不饿。她上一顿饭还是下课后去火车站的路上吃的。从路边的小吃店买了一个汉堡，匆匆忙忙就着一杯热健怡可乐吞下去。那已经是好几个小时前的事了。她虽然很瘦，但饭量一向不小。琼总是开玩笑说，哪一天她一觉醒来会变成一个体重二十英石[1]的大胖子。她一直都觉得自己很贪吃。或许现在没胃口是受了惊吓的缘故。【注：[1]英石（stone），英制重量单位，相当于14磅。20英石相当于280磅，约等于254斤。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At the very least we'll need some water," she said, although even as the words came out she realised that she wasn't thirsty either.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, there's a stream out back," he answered, humour in his voice. "Can't say how clean it'll be, though."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，房子背后有条小河，”他答道，语气有些诙谐，“但我可不敢说水有多干净。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He seemed to read the thoughts in her eyes. Although he turned his face away to stare through the window into the evening, Dylan could see the telltale lifting of his cheek. He was laughing at her. She narrowed her eyes and glowered in the other direction, out of the hole where the back window had once been. She could see next to nothing, just the outline of hills in the distance. The onset of night was making her nervous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦似乎透过眼神读懂了她内心的想法。尽管他把脸转向一旁，凝视着窗外的暮色，但迪伦看到他的脸微微抬了一下，这说明他在嘲笑自己。她眼睛一眯，怒气冲冲地朝别的方向看。屋子原来后窗的位置上有个破洞，迪伦透过破洞向外望，除了远处山峦的轮廓外什么也看不见。晚上才刚开始，她就觉得紧张了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan thought about drinking from the mucky stream. The water probably had mud and bugs in it; it wasn't an appealing suggestion. Besides, she thought, if I drink the water I'll need to use the bathroom, and there doesn't seem to be one. The clouds were bringing the night unusually quickly, and the idea of going out alone in the dark to find a suitable spot was not one she wanted to think about. There were nettles and thistles to consider, plus she would be too scared to go very far, so she would have to worry about staying within earshot. It would all just be too embarrassing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦仔细考虑了一番，自己到底要不要喝污秽的河水。水里可能有污泥和虫子，这建议真不怎么诱人。她又想到，我要是喝了水，就需要上厕所，这儿看起来可没什么能当厕所的地方。乌云让夜晚来得格外的快，她可不想在黑漆漆的晚上一个人出去找地方方便。想想外面那些荨麻和蓟吧，何况她害怕走得太远，在大家的耳朵都能听到的地方方便总有些顾虑，这也太尴尬了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得我们在这儿安全吗？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned back to look at her, his expression unreadable. "Don't worry," he said quietly, "there's nothing out here." The sense of isolation in his words was as chilling as the thought of unknown things scurrying about in the dark, and Dylan shivered involuntarily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转过脸看着她，眼神让人捉摸不透，“别担心，”他说，“外面什么也没有。”他话里那种与世隔绝的意味让人不寒而栗，就像想到黑暗里不知名的东西在快速乱爬一样。迪伦情不自禁地打了个寒战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Cold?" He didn't wait for an answer. "There's a fireplace over there. I've got matches -- I can probably get it going."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冷吗？”他没等她回答，“那边有壁炉，我带有火柴—也许我能把炉子点着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood up and loped over to the stone fireplace, which sat under the remaining piece of roof. The chimney-breast must have strengthened the wall, because this part of the cottage was in the best repair. There were still a few logs strewn about beside it which he gathered and carefully arranged into a precarious tepee shape. Dylan watched him work, captivated by his quiet concentration. As he reached into his pocket, he glanced in her direction and she hastily went back to staring out of the window. Red coloured her cheeks and she hoped he hadn't caught her staring at him. A low chuckle from the direction of the fireplace confirmed that he had and she squirmed in the chair, mortified. The sound of a match striking was accompanied by a light wafting of smoke. She imagined him holding it into the firewood and trying to coax out the flames, but resolutely kept her eyes away from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站起来，迈着大步走到石砌的壁炉前。壁炉上方是残存的一截屋顶，炉腔肯定对墙体起了加固作用，因为整个屋子就数这块地方保养得最好。壁炉旁的地上堆着几根原木，他把木头拢在一起，小心地搭成一个摇摇欲坠的圆锥形。迪伦看着他忙活，他平心静气、全神贯注地做事的样子吸引了她。他伸进口袋里摸火柴时朝她的方向瞥了一眼，她赶忙回头继续望向窗外。她脸上泛起红晕，希望他刚才没有注意到自己在看他。壁炉方向传来的低沉笑声证明她的希望落空了，折了面子的她在椅子上坐立不安。耳边传来划火柴的声音，与此同时飘来一缕淡淡的烟。她想象着他把火柴塞进木柴中，尽力引火的样子，但坚决不看他一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan went back to staring out of the window, even though there was nothing to see. Having used up all of her nerve broaching conversations that had been shut down before they could really begin, Dylan did not dare interrupt his brooding. Instead she folded her arms on the table and leaned her chin on them, staring away from him and into the fire. The dance of the flames hypnotised her and before long she felt her eyelids droop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦又开始向窗外望去，即使外面什么也看不到。刚才的几次谈话总是刚开了头就被打断了，迪伦已经用尽了自己所有的勇气，她不敢在他沉思的时候打搅他。她两臂相交靠在桌上，下巴支在胳膊上，目光躲着崔斯坦，只盯着那团火焰出神。跳动的火苗让她犯困，不一会儿的工夫她的眼皮就垂了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Barring a sudden gust of gale-force wind, we should be a bit warmer in a few minutes," he said, standing up and ambling back across the room to his makeshift seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是不突然刮一阵大风，过个几分钟我们就暖和点了。”他说着站起身来，悠然地踱回他的临时座位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks," Dylan mumbled, and meant it. She was grateful for the fire; it chased away the dark that was creeping over the land. She turned slightly and gazed into the flames, watching each one jump and leap over the logs. Soon the heat began to radiate out of the hearth, bathing them both in warmth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。”迪伦嗫嚅着说。她是由衷地感谢这堆火，火赶走了慢慢降临大地的黑暗。她微微欠身，注视着壁炉里的火焰，观察着木柴上火焰的每一次跳跃。很快，壁炉里的热气开始向外扩散，他们两个都沐浴在温暖中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the curtain of sleep closed over her, she heard the wind rushing around the crumbling walls of the cottage. Though she couldn't feel the chill of its touch, she heard the wailing as it whistled through cracks and crevices, searching for a way in. The sound was eerie, frightening. She trembled uncomfortably, but tried to stifle the movement before Tristan noticed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睡意如帷幕般一点点笼罩着她，她听到风在摇摇欲坠的破墙间回旋激荡。虽然她感受不到风吹过时的寒气，但她听得到风呼啸着穿过罅隙与裂缝，想要钻进屋里时的呜咽声，这声音听起来非常古怪吓人。她不安地颤抖起来，但趁着崔斯坦没注意，她尽量控制着身体，不让自己抖得太厉害。">查看中文翻译</div>
