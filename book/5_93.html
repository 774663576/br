<div class="line_en">She wasn't even sure why she'd said it, why she'd suddenly felt the need to make fun of the next-door neighbor. With a sigh, she went back into the house. The moment she stepped into the room, the smell of pot overwhelmed her, stung her eyes. On the sofa, her mom lay spread-eagled, one leg on the coffee table, one on the back cushions. Her mouth hung open; drool sparkled the corners of her lips.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully didn't bother answering. Her mother always forgot what they were talking about anyway. It made any real conversation impossible, and usually Tully didn't care -- she wanted to talk to Cloud like she wanted to watch black and white movies -- but now, since that girl's visit, Tully felt her differentness keenly. If she had a real family -- a mom who made casseroles and sent them as gifts to new neighbors -- she wouldn't feel so alone. She sat down in one of the mustard-colored beanbag chairs that flanked the sofa and said cautiously, "I wonder what Gran's doing right now."</div>

<div class="line_en">A few nights later, after a dinner of Pop-Tarts and Alpha-Bits cereal, Tully took a long, hot shower, shaved her legs and underarms carefully, and dried her hair until it fell straight from her center part without a single crease or curl. Then she went to her closet and stood there, trying to figure out what to wear. This was her first high school party. She needed to look just right. None of the other girls from the junior high had been invited. She was The One. Pat Richmond, the best-looking guy on the football team, had chosen Tully for his date. They'd been at the local hamburger hangout last Wednesday night, his group of friends and hers. All it had taken was one look between them. Pat had broken free of the crowd of huge guys and walked right over to Tully.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They have to like me." Kate sighed. "The kids at school treat me like I've got an infectious disease. I used to have friends, but… you probably don't know what in the heck I'm talking about. You're so popular."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不得不喜欢我。”凯蒂叹息，“同学都排挤我，好像我有传染病一样。我以前有两个好朋友，可是…你大概很难体会吧？你那么有人气。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you okay?" Kate asked quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没事吧？”凯蒂轻声问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Silence fell between them. Tully finished her cigarette and put it out. They were so different, she and Kate, as full of contrasts as this dark field bathed in moonlight, but it felt so completely easy to talk to her. Tully found herself almost smiling, and on this, the worst night of her life. That was something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默再次降临。塔莉将烟蒂捻熄，她和凯蒂的差别非常大，就像月光下的黑暗农场一样对比分明，但是和她聊天感觉很自在。这明明是她这辈子最惨的一夜，但塔莉却觉得想微笑，这种感觉很特别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once again, Kate hugged her. Tully let herself be comforted for the first time since she was little. When she finally drew back, she tried to smile. "I'm drowning you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, Kate yawned and Tully stood up. "I better book."</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next hour, they sat there, talking now and then and sometimes just sitting in silence. They didn't say anything really important or share any more secrets, they just talked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来一个钟头，她们坐在那里随意闲聊，偶尔只是静静坐着。她们没有说什么真的很重要的事情，也没有吐露其他秘密，只是东拉西扯地聊着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They got up and walked down to the road. At the mailboxes, Kate stopped. "Well. 'Bye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们一起走到路边，凯蒂停在信箱旁，“嗯，拜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'Bye." Tully stood there a moment, feeling awkward. She wanted to hug Kate, maybe even cling to her and tell her how much this night had been helped by her, but she didn't dare. She'd learned a thing or two about vulnerability from her mother, and she felt too fragile now to risk humiliation. Turning, she headed down to her house. Once inside, she went straight to the shower. There, with the hot water beating down on her, she thought about what had happened to her tonight -- what she'd let happen because she wanted to be cool -- and she cried. When she was done and the tears had turned into a hard little knot in her throat, she took the memory of this night and boxed it up. She shelved it in the back alongside memories of the times Cloud had abandoned her and immediately began working on forgetting it was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拜。”塔莉踌躇了一下，感觉很别扭。她想拥抱凯蒂，甚至想黏着她，跟她说她今晚带给自己很大的帮助，但她不敢开口。妈妈让她明白暴露软弱有多危险，现在她的心情太脆弱，承受不住羞辱打击。她转身朝自己家走去，一进门立刻冲进淋浴间，在热水的冲刷下，她想着今晚的遭遇，想着因为装酷而害自己受到伤害，她哭了出来。澡洗完了，眼泪也干了，只剩哽在喉咙里的一个小硬块，她将今晚的记忆塞进箱子里，藏在内心最深处的架子上，那里也藏着她被白云遗弃的回忆，接着立刻开始努力遗忘。">查看中文翻译</div>
