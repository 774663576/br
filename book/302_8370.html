<div class="line_en">As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs. Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed! -- but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy. It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅途开头一段，大家心情抑郁，只觉得道路漫长，索然无味。但是，临近终点的时候，一看到马上就要居住的乡间，兴致就冒了出来，沮丧的情绪顿时被压了下去。而一走进巴顿山谷，大家便都情不自禁地兴奋起来。这地方景色宜人，土质肥沃，林木茂密，牧草丰盛。沿着蜿蜒的山谷走上一英里多路，便来到她们的家，屋前只有个绿茵小院，她们母女几个穿过一道整齐的小门，走进院里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子的位置选得恰到好处。紧靠屋后，山峦耸立；左右不远，也有峰峦依傍；群山之中，有的是开阔的高地，有的是耕地和林带。巴顿村大致建在一座山上，立在乡舍窗口举目远跳，景色十分宜人。房舍正面，视野尤为开阔，整个山谷一览无余，目力所及，直达远处乡间。山谷绵延到乡舍跟前，终于被三面环抱的山峦截断；但是在两座最陡峭的山峦之间，沿另一方向，岔出一条另有名目的支谷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. "As for the house itself, to be sure," said she, "it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building. These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage. I could wish the stairs were handsome. But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个说来，达什伍德太太对房子的大小和陈设还是满意的。因为她虽然习惯了先前的生活方式，以后少不得要添这置那的，然而添置和修缮对她是一种乐趣。眼前她倒有足够的现钱，可以把一个个房间装潢得更漂亮些。“至于房子本身嘛出：“史学所以经世，固非空言著述也。”这是对宋明理学空，”她说，“的确是太小了，我们一家人住不下，不过岁时已晚，来不及改建，暂且凑合着也够舒服的了。也许到了春天，如果我手头宽裕的话（我想一定会宽裕的），咱们再考虑改建的事儿。我希望经常邀请朋友们来这里聚会，可是这两间客厅太小了。我有点想法，准备把一间客厅扩大，加进走廊，也许再加进另一间客厅的一部分，而把那间客厅的余下部分改作走廊。这么一来，再有一间新客厅（这很容易增加），一间卧室和阁楼，就能把我们的小乡舍安排得小巧精当、舒舒服服。我本来还想把楼梯修得漂亮些，但是人不能期望一口吃成个胖子，虽然把它加宽一下没有什么难处。到了春天，我还要看看手头有多少钱，然后根据情况来计划我们的装潢修缮。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient. Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早饭后不久，正当母女们如此这般忙碌不停的时候，房东登门拜访来了。他欢迎她们来到巴顿，眼前如有短缺不便之处，从他邸园里可以提供一切方便。约翰。米德尔顿爵士是个四十来岁的美男于。他以前曾去过斯坦希尔，不过那是很久以前的事，他那几位年轻的表侄女记不得他了。他和颜悦色，那风度就像他的信一样亲切友好。看来，她们的到来使他感到由衷的高兴，她们的舒适成为他深为关切的问题。他一再表示，诚挚地希望他们两家能亲密相处，热忱地恳求她们在安顿好之前，每天到巴顿庄园用餐。他一个劲地恳求着，简直到了有失体统的地步，但是并不会惹得对方生气。他的一片好心不光挂在嘴皮上，他走后不到半个钟头，就打，发人从巴顿庄园送来一大篮子蔬菜水果，天黑之前又送来些野味。此外，他执意要替她们往邮局送取来往信件，还乐于把自己的报纸每天送给她们看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking, and her address graceful. Her manners had all the elegance which her husband's wanted. But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，她们很想见见她，因为她们以后能否在巴顿过上舒适日子，在很大程度上有赖于她，她的光临正合她们的心愿。米德尔顿夫人不过二十六七岁，脸蛋俊俏，身材苗条，仪态妩媚动人。她丈夫缺少的优雅举止，她倒一应俱全。不过，她若是多少具备几分她丈夫的坦率和热情，举止还会显得更加优雅。但她呆的时间一长，达什伍德母女就不像开头那样对她赞羡不已了。因为她虽然受过良好的教养，但却不苟言笑，冷冷淡淡，除了极其简单地寒响几句之外，别无他话可说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could make noise enough at home. On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，话儿还是没有少说，因为约翰爵士喜好闲聊，而且米德尔顿夫人也有先见之明，带来了她的大孩于。他是个六岁上下的小男孩，这就是说，一旦谈话陷入僵局，他可以成为太太小姐们反复提及的话题。因为大伙儿少不得总要问问他叫什么名字，今年几岁啦，称赞称赞他的美貌，然后再提些别的问题，不过统统都得由母亲代为回答。出乎米德尔顿夫人意料之外，这孩子紧紧偎依在她身旁，一直低着头。她不由的纳闷：他在家里还大吵大闹的，到了客人面前怎么这样羞羞答答。每逢正式探亲访友，为了提供谈话的资料，人们该带上孩子一同前往。现在，大伙儿足足用了十分钟，谈论这孩子究竟像父亲还是像母亲，以及具体地在哪些地方像哪个人。当然，大家的看法很不一致，各人都对别人的看法表示惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过不多久，达什伍德母女就会有机会对客人的另外几个孩子展开一场争论，因为约翰爵士得不到她们同意第二天去巴顿庄园用餐的许诺，说什么也不肯离去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米德尔顿夫人托丈夫捎了个十分客气的口信，表示愿意在她确信不会给她们带来不便的时候，立即来拜访达什伍德太太。作为回答，达什伍德太太同样客气地提出了邀请，于是主要代表有美国的布莱特曼（EdgarSheffieldBrightmann，，这位夫人第二天就被引见给达什伍德母女。">查看中文翻译</div>
