<div class="line_en">The first time I called, Billy answered and told me that Jacob was still in bed. I got nosy, checking to make sure that Billy had taken him to a doctor. Billy said he had, but, for some reason I couldn't nail down, I didn't really believe him. I called again, several times a day, for the next two days, but no one was ever there.</div>

<div class="line_en">I made Charlie call Harry Clearwater as soon as he got home from work. I waited, anxious, while Charlie chatted with his old friend; the conversation seemed to go on forever without Jacob even being mentioned. It seemed that Harry had been in the hospital… some kind of tests for his heart. Charlie's forehead got all pinched together, but Harry joked with him, blowing it off, until Charlie was laughing again. Only then did Charlie ask about Jacob, and now his side of the conversation didn't give me much to work with, just a lot of hmms and yeahs. I drummed my fingers against the counter beside him until he put a hand over mine to stop me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理一下班，我就让他给哈里？克力尔沃特打电话。查理和他这位老朋友聊着天，我在一旁焦急地等待。他们的谈话似乎根本扯不上雅各布。听上去哈里好像是在医院里…… 做心脏检查什么的。查理愁容满面，哈里却和他开着玩笑，逗得查理又笑了起来。这时，查理才问到雅各布的情况，但他只是嗯嗯啊啊地回应几句，让我很难猜出他们到底在说些什么。我用手指不停地敲着他旁边的橱柜，直到他用手按住我的手指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't push it. Charlie was too worried about Harry. That was clearly the more important issue -- it wouldn't be right to bug him with my lesser concerns. Instead, I went straight upstairs and turned on my computer. I found a medical site online and typed "mononucleosis" into the search box.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没再问下去。查理很担心哈里，这显然是更严重的问题——我不应该再拿我的烦恼去打扰他。于是我上楼打开了电脑，上网查到了一个医学网页。我在搜索栏里键入了“单核细胞增多症”字样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All I knew about mono was that you were supposed to get it from kissing, which was clearly not the case with Jake. I read through the symptoms quickly -- the fever he definitely had, but what about the rest of it? No horrible sore throat, no exhaustion, no headaches, at least not before he'd gone home from the movie; he'd said he felt "fit as a fiddle." Did it really come on so fast? The article made it sound like the sore stuff showed up first.</div>

Just the horrible nothingness -- half the time in the forest, half the time in the empty fern sea where the white house no longer existed. Sometimes Sam Uley was there in the forest, watching me again. I paid him no attention -- there was no comfort in his presence; it made me feel no less alone.

<div class="line_en">As if in answer to my question, suddenly the mammoth wolf was not alone. Flanking it on either side, another two gigantic beasts prowled silently into the meadow.
