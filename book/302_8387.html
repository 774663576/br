<div class="line_en">However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in thepresent case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly ofinventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted tobe true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supportedas it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, andcontradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their opportunity ofacquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of theMiss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which hadoften surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formedaltogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear ofcondemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partialitycould set aside, his ill-treatment of herself. -- Her resentment of suchbehaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short timemade her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had hefeigned a regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement toLucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. His affection was all herown. She could not be deceived in that. Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not anillusion of her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softenerof the heart was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her toforgive! He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining atNorland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than itought to be. In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injuredher, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever beingotherwise. She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had heto look forward to? Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with hisintegrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with awife like her-illiterate, artful, and selfish?</div>

<div class="line_en">If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficultiesfrom his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likelyto be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior inconnections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. Thesedifficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might notpress very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of theperson by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华与埃丽诺成婚尚且要遇到他母亲设置的种种障碍，那么他选择一个门第比她低下、财产很可能不及她多的女人作配偶，岂不是更加困难重重！当然，他在感情上与露西还很疏远，这些困难还不至于使他忍耐不住。但是，这位本来对家庭的反对和刁难可以感到欣慰的人，他的心情却是抑郁的！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she weptfor him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of havingdone nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by thebelief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thoughtshe could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, commandherself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her motherand sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had firstsuffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would havesupposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourningin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the objectof her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on theperfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughlypossessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drovenear their house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺连续痛苦地思考着，不禁为他（不是为她自己）骤然落泪。使她坚信不疑的是，她没有做出什么事情而活该遭受目前的不幸；同时使她感到欣慰的是，爱德华也没做出什么事情而不配受到她的器重。她觉得，即使现在阐述伊斯兰改革理论的著作有《伊斯兰宗教思想的重建》等。，就在她忍受这沉重打击的头一阵剧痛之际，她也能尽量克制自己，以防母亲和妹妹们对事实真相产生怀疑。她是这么期望的，也是不折不扣地这么做的。就在她的美好，希望破灭后仅仅两个小时，她就加入她们一道吃晚饭，结果从妹妹们的表情上看得出来，谁也没有想到埃丽诺正在为即将把她和她心爱的人永远隔离开的种种障碍而暗自悲伤；而玛丽安却在暗中眷念着一位十全十美的情人，认为他的心完全被她迷住了，每一辆，马车驶近她们房舍时，她都期望着能见到他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeedingyears-years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to theunderstanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior societyand more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicitywhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她知道，她从她们的忠告或是谈话里得不到帮助。她们的温情和悲伤只能增加她的痛苦，而对于她的自我克制，她们既不会通过以身作则，又不会通过正面赞扬加以鼓励。她独自一个人的时候反倒更刚强些，她能非常理智地控制自己，尽管刚刚遇到如此痛心疾首的事情，她还是尽量表现得坚定不移，始终显得高高兴兴的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had beenentrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasingexertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. On the contrary itwas a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would givesuch affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing thatcondemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess oftheir partial affection for herself, and which was more than she feltequal to support.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺虽然不得不一忍再忍，把露西给她讲的私房话始终瞒着母亲和玛丽安，但这并未加深她的痛苦。相反，使她感到宽慰的是，她用不着告诉她们一些只会给她们带来痛苦的伤心事，因而省得听见她们指责爱德华。由于大家过于偏爱她，这种指责是很可能的，那将是她不堪忍受的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on thesubject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this formore reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of theirengagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand whatLucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in herdeclaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted toconvince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and hercalmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested init than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntaryagitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at leastdoubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared veryprobable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in herpraise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing totrust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret soconfessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's jokingintelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinorremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved byEdward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make itnatural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her veryconfidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of theaffair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it ofLucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival'sintentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as everyprinciple of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affectionfor Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not denyherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart wasunwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear onthe subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her ownability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然她与露西在这个问题上的头一次谈话让她吃尽了苦头，但是她转眼间又渴望和她重谈—次，而且理由不止一个。她想听她重新介绍一些有关他们订婚的许多详细情况，想更清楚地了解一下露西对爱德华的真实感情，看看她是不是真像她宣称的那样对他一往情深。她还特别想通过主动地、心平气和地再谈谈这件事“天地合气，万物自生”，提出元气自然论。北宋张载以太虚，让露西相信：她只不过是以朋友的身份来关心此事的，而这一点从早晨的谈话来看，由于她不知不觉地变得十分焦灼不安，因而至少是令人怀疑的。看样子，露西很可能妒忌她。显而易见，爱德华总是在称赞她，这不仅从露西的话里听得出来，而且还表现在她才认识她这么短时间，就大胆地自她吐露了如此重大的一桩秘密。甚至连约翰爵士开玩笑的话，大概也起到一定作用。的确，埃丽诺既然深信爱德华真心喜爱自己，她也就不必去考虑别的可能性，便自然而然地认为露西在妒忌她。露西也确实在妒忌她，她的私房话就是个证明。露西透露这桩事，除了想告诉埃丽诺爱德华是属于她的，让她以后少同他接触之外，还会有什么别的动机呢？她不难理解她的情敌的这番用意，她决心切实按照真诚体面的原则来对待她，克制住她对爱德华的感情，尽量少同他见面。同时，她还要聊以自慰地向露西表明，她并不为此感到伤心，如今在这个问题上，她不会听到比已经听到的更使她痛苦的事了，因此她相信自己能够平心静气地听露西把详情重新叙说一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affordingElinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called atthe cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that theywould all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged toattend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw afairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as thiswas likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquiland well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband unitedthem together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted theinvitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equallycompliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of theirparties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have herseclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could becommanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to takeadvantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fineenough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might mosteasily separate themselves from the others; and though they met atleast every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly atthe former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake ofconversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or LadyMiddleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given fora general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. They met forthe sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.</div>

The insipidity of themeeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not onenovelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interestingthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour anddrawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and whilethey remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility ofengaging Lucy's attention to attempt it.
