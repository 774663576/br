<div class="line_en">The rest of September was hard. I wasn't used to getting up so early in the morning. I wasn't used to this whole notion of homework. And I got my first "quiz" at the end of the month. I never got "quizzes" when Mom homeschooled me. I also didn't like how I had no free time anymore. Before, I was able to play whenever I wanted to, but now it felt like I always had stuff to do for school.</div>

<div class="line_en">And being at school was awful in the beginning. Every new class I had was like a new chance for kids to "not stare" at me. They would sneak peeks at me from behind their notebooks or when they thought I wasn't looking. They would take the longest way around me to avoid bumping into me in any way, like I had some germ they could catch, like my face was contagious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始的时候，我的校园生活实在太糟糕了。对同学们来说，每上一门新课都像是一个新的“不能盯着看”我的机会。他们会从笔记本后面或者认为我没注意的时候鬼鬼祟祟地瞄我一眼。为了避免在路上碰见我，他们会兜上一个大圈子，好像我身上有细菌，好像我的脸会传染。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the hallways, which were always crowded, my face would always surprise some unsuspecting kid who maybe hadn't heard about me. The kid would make the sound you make when you hold your breath before going underwater, a little "uh!" sound. This happened maybe four or five times a day for the first few weeks: on the stairs, in front of the lockers, in the library. Five hundred kids in a school: eventually every one of them was going to see my face at some time. And I knew after the first couple of days that word had gotten around about me, because every once in a while I'd catch a kid elbowing his friend as they passed me, or talking behind their hands as I walked by them. I can only imagine what they were saying about me. Actually, I prefer not to even try to imagine it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走廊总是很拥挤，我的脸总是会惊吓到某一个毫无心理准备的同学，也许他还没听说过我。他会发出一个人在入水之前屏住呼吸的声音，小小的“呼”的一声。头几个星期，这样的事情每天都会发生四五次：在楼梯上，在储物柜前，在图书馆里。学校有五百个孩子：最终他们每个人都会在某个时刻看见我的脸。才几天时间，我就知道关于我的一个外号已经传开，因为每隔一会儿我就会看见一个同学在经过我身边时用手肘推推他的朋友，或是在我路过他们时捂着嘴说悄悄话。我只能想象他们在谈论我什么。事实上，我宁愿不去想象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took about one week for the kids in my class to get used to my face. These were the kids I'd see every day in all my classes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm not saying they were doing any of these things in a mean way, by the way: not once did any kid laugh or make noises or do anything like that. They were just being normal dumb kids. I know that. I kind of wanted to tell them that. Like, it's okay, I'm know I'm weird-looking, take a look, I don't bite. Hey, the truth is, if a Wookiee started going to the school all of a sudden, I'd be curious, I'd probably stare a bit! And if I was walking with Jack or Summer, I'd probably whisper to them: Hey, there's the Wookiee. And if the Wookiee caught me saying that, he'd know I wasn't trying to be mean. I was just pointing out the fact that he's a Wookiee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顺便说一下，我不是说他们这么做的时候怀着恶意，没有一个同学大笑或者发出什么声音，类似的事情一次都没有发生。他们只是正常的傻孩子。我知道这一点。我有点想跟他们打开天窗说亮话。比如，没关系，我知道自己长相奇怪，看看吧，我不咬人的。唉，事实上，如果一个伍基人突然来学校上学，我也会好奇的，我也可能会盯着他看！如果我跟杰克或萨默尔走在路上，我也许会低声对他们说：喂，那边有个伍基人。如果那个伍基人听到我说的话，他也会知道我不怀恶意。我只不过指出了一个事实：他是个伍基人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took about a month for the rest of the kids in the entire school to get used to it. These were the kids in all the other grades. They were big kids, some of them. Some of them had crazy haircuts. Some of them had earrings in their noses. Some of them had pimples. None of them looked like me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多过了一个月，全校同学才慢慢接受了我的脸。各个年级的同学。他们中有一些人已经是大孩子了。有的发型夸张搞笑。有的鼻子上戴着鼻环。有的一脸青春痘。但没有一个人看起来像我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took about two weeks for the rest of the kids in my grade to get used to my face. These were the kids I'd see in the cafeteria, yard time, PE, music, library, computer class.</div>
