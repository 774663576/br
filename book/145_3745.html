<div class="line_en">By noon the field seethed with people and livestock, heat and dust. Buyers squeezed the flesh of sheep, haggled over cows, donkeys and goats. Alongside, the snack stalls were doing a roaring trade. A baker with an ear-splitting yell invited customers to taste his piping hot samsa, small pastry parcels of lamb and onion that he plucked from the domed walls of his tandoor oven. Young men lolled on ironwork benches under a canvas shelter, eating ice cream with a spoon as they watched noisy Kung Fu films on a propped-up television. Everywhere, people were slurping fruit juice or cool jellies in spicy dressings. The crowds milled around, talking and shouting in a melodic, guttural tongue that sounded like Turkish. The air was filled with the punchy scent of cumin from sizzling kebabs.</div>

<div class="line_en">At seven o'clock on Sunday morning, the market was already coming to life. Bakers were hooking the first batches of nan bread out of tandoor ovens. Snack-sellers were lighting fires under their stoves, setting up cauldrons of soup to boil, and chopping piles of vegetables and hunks of mutton. The rising sun spilled through the poplar trees bordering the field, marking out long fingers of light on the ground. And already the first market-traders were arriving, steering donkey carts laden with produce, or driving flocks of bleeting sheep into the great livestock enclosure. Hungry after an early start, I bought a nan from one of the bakers. The golden, onion-speckled crust yielded to fluffy white dough: it was magnificently tasty.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had wanted to go to Xinjiang for some time. Although I hadn't completed my research project on China's ethnic minorities, I'd always been attracted by the diverse cultures of the western regions, and their grasslands and deserts -- wide open spaces that offered respite from the crowded intensity of China proper. As a student I had hitchhiked around the Tibetan provinces of Amdo and Kham, but I'd never made it as far as Kashgar. Years later, it wasn't just the thirst for adventure that drew me to Xinjiang. As a food writer, I had a particular desire to explore a region that lay at the culinary crossroads of Asia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本来想去新疆一段时间。虽然我还没有完成关于中国少数民族的研究项目，但我一直被西部地区的多元文化以及他们的草原和沙漠所吸引，这些广阔的开放空间为缓解中国人的拥挤程度提供了喘息的机会。作为一名学生，我曾搭便车游览过西藏的安多省和汗省，但我从未到过喀什。多年后，吸引我来到新疆的不仅仅是对冒险的渴望。作为一名美食作家，我特别想探索一个位于亚洲烹饪十字路口的地区。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found it hard to believe that I was still in China. The only reminder was the occasional street or shop sign, with Chinese characters alongside the local, Arabic-based script. Kashgar, the Silk Road town where this famous Sunday market draws trade from far and wide, lies in the desert province of Xinjiang, at the westernmost tip of the country. This vast region occupies a sixth of China's territory, and is home to myriad ethnic groups, including the Turkic Uyghur people, the largest minority, Tajiks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Russians and, increasingly, Han Chinese.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Xinjiang one still senses this ancient connection between the Chinese and Eurasian worlds. At the market that day, I wandered among the farmers' stalls, where fruits and vegetables were laid out on the ground. The produce itself was a living record of the region's multicultural history. When the Han Dynasty Chinese envoy Zhang Qian passed through this area in the second century BC on his missions from Chang'an to the kingdoms of Central Asia, legend says he returned with new foodstuffs that were to have a lasting impact on Chinese cuisine: grapes, alfalfa, coriander and sesame, all of which are still of vital importance in the Uyghur diet. Still, you see carts of alfalfa and dried grapes in the markets, and the scent of sesame hangs over freshly baked bread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在新疆，人们仍然能感觉到中国和欧亚大陆之间的这种古老联系。那天在集市上，我在农民的摊位间闲逛，那里的水果和蔬菜摆在地上。这件作品本身就是该地区多元文化历史的生动记录。公元前2世纪，汉朝的中国特使张谦从长安到中亚诸国执行任务时经过此地，传说他带着对中国烹饪产生持久影响的新食品回来了：葡萄、苜蓿、香菜和芝麻，所有这些在维吾尔族饮食中仍然是至关重要的。不过，你仍然可以在市场上看到一车车的苜蓿和干葡萄，新鲜出炉的面包上弥漫着芝麻的香味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More than 2000 years ago, trade began along the perilous overland routes between China and the West that later became known as the Silk Road. Camel caravans carried silk and other luxuries out of China, bringing back spices, precious stones and the sacred texts of Buddhism. Kashgar was one of a string of thriving oasis towns that lay on the route from Central Asia to the glittering Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an (at the site of modern Xi'an). It was only after the opening of the sea routes in the late fifteenth century that the region lost its vitality, and many of the towns were reclaimed by the desert sands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Other foods such as carrots, cucumber and onions also found their way into Xinjiang, and then China, along the desert roads. The names of fruits and vegetables in the Uyghur tongue carry echoes of languages from all over Asia: the Turkic piaz for onions and uzum for grapes, Chinese words for garlic stems and Chinese cabbage, turup like the Persian torobcheh for scarlet radishes. And, alongside the crops that entered this region along the ancient land routes are sold the New World tomatoes, potatoes and chillies that revolutionised the diet here as in so many other countries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胡萝卜、黄瓜和洋葱等其他食物也沿着沙漠道路进入新疆，然后进入中国。维吾尔语中的水果和蔬菜的名称与亚洲各地的语言相呼应：突厥语中的piaz表示洋葱，uzum表示葡萄，汉语中的单词表示大蒜茎和大白菜，肿胀得像波斯的torobcheh表示猩红色的萝卜。而且，除了沿着古老的陆地路线进入这个地区的农作物之外，新大陆的西红柿、土豆和辣椒也在销售，这些食物和其他许多国家一样，在这里彻底改变了人们的饮食习惯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As usual, I was hovering around the food stalls that day, watching the cooks at work and pestering them with questions. The ice-cream vendor presided over a juddering machine that whipped up ice-cream in a copper cauldron surrounded by ice. At the back of the stall, enormous blocks of ice lay out on a table, melting slowly. 'How do you make ice on that scale, in September?' I asked him. 'We cut it from the frozen lakes in winter, and haul it back to Kashgar on a donkey cart,' came the unlikely reply. But it was true, the ice was mud-streaked and threaded with reeds to prove it. 'We can keep it all summer,' he told me, 'wrapped up and stored in underground pits.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像往常一样，那天我在食品摊周围徘徊，看着厨师们在工作，用问题纠缠着他们。卖冰淇淋的小贩主持了一台摇摇晃晃的机器，它在一个被冰包围的铜锅里搅拌冰淇淋。在摊位后面，巨大的冰块摊在桌子上，慢慢融化。九月份，你怎么用这种比例制冰？我问他。“我们在冬天从冰冻的湖里把它切下来，然后用驴车把它运回喀什，”这个不太可能的回答说。但这是真的，冰上有泥痕，上面有芦苇证明了这一点。他告诉我，我们可以把它整个夏天保存起来，包起来存放在地下坑里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For me, all this was fascinating. In my early twenties, during that long, hot summer when I stayed with a Turkish family in Anatolia, learning a little Turkish and Turkish cookery, I had stood on the brink of Europe, looking east; and here I was, a decade later, on the edge of China, looking back in the direction of Istanbul.</div>

<div class="line_en">I chose to eat a bowlful of their noodles rather than mine, sitting at a table in the sun with a motley assortment of Uyghur sheep-traders. The boiled pasta was topped with a colourful stew of mutton and vegetables: red and green peppers, garlic stems, onion, tomato and cabbage. I plunged in with my chopsticks. The noodles were fresh and springy in my mouth, utterly delicious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我选择吃一碗他们的面条，而不是我的，坐在阳光下的桌子旁，桌上摆着各式各样的维吾尔族羊贩。煮熟的意大利面上放着五颜六色的炖羊肉和蔬菜：红椒和青椒、蒜茎、洋葱、西红柿和卷心菜。我用筷子插进去。面条在我嘴里又新鲜又有弹性，非常美味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At another stall, young men in embroidered caps pulled noodle dough into lengths that they swung and looped in the air, stretching it into strands as fine and even as spaghetti. I persuaded them to let me try. It was an impossible task. In my hands, the dough stretched unevenly, the noodles snapped and shrivelled. Again and again I tried. Occasionally I found my rhythm, and the noodles spun out evenly for a moment, but then they disintegrated, collapsing into a jumble on the wooden board. The boys laughed at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在另一个摊位上，戴着绣花帽的年轻人把面团拉长，在空中盘旋，伸展成细细的甚至像意大利面一样的细丝。我说服他们让我试试。这是一项不可能完成的任务。在我的手里，面团伸得不均匀，面条啪啪地一声就干瘪了。我一次又一次地尝试。偶尔我发现我的节奏，面条均匀地旋转了一会儿，但随后它们就解体了，在木板上崩塌成一团。孩子们嘲笑我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cooking of the Uyghur people, too, has echoes of both east and west. Their noodles and dumplings link with the band of pasta-eaters who live across northern China as far as Beijing, and they eat them with chopsticks in the Chinese style. The Kashgar spice stalls sell the familiar aromatics of Chinese cookery -- Sichuan pepper, star anise, Chinese cardamom and fennel -- but they also dispense herbs and flavourings redolent of Persia and Central Asia: saffron, green cardamom, safflower and rose petals. And while the Uyghur drink tea, constantly, like the Chinese, they show their nomadic heritage in their liking for yoghurt and other dairy foods.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region remains an anomaly in the Chinese empire. The Uyghur people have even less in common with the Han Chinese than do the Tibetans: they are Central Asians in almost every sense, part of the great family of Turks that extends from Xinjiang through Uzbekistan and across central Asia, as far as modern Turkey itself. They speak a variant of Turkish and eat kebabs, and their faith is Islam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新疆维吾尔自治区仍然是中华帝国的一个异常。维吾尔族人与汉族人的共同点甚至比藏族人还要少：他们几乎在任何意义上都是中亚人，是从新疆延伸到乌兹别克斯坦和中亚，直至现代土耳其本身的土耳其人大家庭的一部分。他们说土耳其语的变体，吃烤肉串，他们的信仰是伊斯兰教。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the Chinese, of course, this was always a barbarian land. In the past, they thought civilisation itself ended more than 1000 miles east of Kashgar, at the Jiayuguan fort in Gansu Province, where the last garrison of the Great Wall marked the boundary of the Chinese empire. From the eighteenth century onwards, however, the Manchu Qing state consolidated its grip on this outlying desert region, and a Muslim rebellion against Chinese rule in the 1870s was brutally crushed. In the 1930s, as China fell apart under the stress of warlordism, revolution and foreign invasion, the local people seized their moment and proclaimed a republic, East Turkestan. But it was short-lived. And then in 1949, Mao's victorious communists swept in with their peculiar brand of 'liberation', which actually meant, as it did in Tibet, de facto colonisation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，对中国人来说，这里一直都是蛮荒之地。过去，他们认为文明本身结束于喀什以东1000多英里的甘肃省嘉峪关堡，在那里，长城的最后一个驻军标志着中华帝国的边界。然而，从18世纪开始，满清政府巩固了对这个边远沙漠地区的控制，19世纪70年代穆斯林反抗中国统治的叛乱被残酷镇压。20世纪30年代，中国在军阀主义、革命和外国侵略的压力下解体，当地人民抓住时机，宣布成立东突厥斯坦共和国。但这是短暂的。然后在1949年，毛的胜利的共产党人以他们独特的“解放”的品牌席卷进来，这实际上意味着，就像在西藏一样，事实上的殖民。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was an almost Mediterranean warmth about the Uyghur. The men clasped hands when they greeted each other; people laughed freely and moved sinuously. All this was delightful to me, and such a contrast to the emotionally reserved Chinese. Even better, Xinjiang was the one place in China where a Western woman, tall, with brown hair and green eyes, could disappear into the crowd if she chose to, and walk through a market without attracting attention. Most of the Uyghur had Caucasian features; some of the local people were fair-haired and green eyed. After the relentless scrunity to which I had become accustomed in China, it was a sweet relief to be so inconspicuous.</div>

<div class="line_en">As students in the nineties, intent on venturing into forbidden parts of China, my classmates and I had found the mere existence of Xinjiang fantastically useful. Most of us had never been there, but we had all run into Uyghurs in other parts of China, and been told by Chinese people how much we looked like them. We were well aware that in the backwoods of places like Tibet and Gansu, no one would expect in their wildest dreams to run into an actual Westerner. If we concealed our cameras, fancy sunglasses and conspicuously Western clothing, we could easily pass for 'Xinjiang people', with our big noses and strangely accented Chinese.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, out in the Xinjiang countryside, somewhere near the Pakistan border, I left the car I had hired and climbed up a hillside in search of a discreet place to pee. I had been in the region for a week or two, and was dressed modestly in cotton clothes. I had a few scarves wrapped loosely around my head and shoulders, to fend off the ferocious late-summer sun. On my way back down the hill, I was surprised to run into a middle-aged Han Chinese tourist with a long-lensed camera. He gave me a kindly and patronising smile. 'Hello, young lady,' he said, 'So what national minority are you?' He clearly thought he'd discovered a member of a semi-forgotten tribe of nomads, and I didn't like to disappoint him.

<div class="line_en">I did, of course, look bizarre by anyone's standards. Not only did I stand out like a sore thumb on that bus full of Chinese peasants, I looked like no one you would ever run into in Xinjiang or anywhere else in China. Nonetheless, as I knew perfectly well, everyone on the bus would dimly remember some middle-school textbook that rambled on about the colourful, singing-and-dancing ethnic minorities of China, with their outlandish styles of dress and quaint social customs.

I knew that the area I was in was closed to foreigners, so I had tucked my hair into a pair of black knickers and swathed my head in a great black scarf, which I imagined gave me a slightly Arabic air. My eyes were concealed behind a pair of crude, wonky Chinese-peasant sunglasses, my backpack was hidden in the kind of white plastic sack that people used for carrying grain, and I was dressed in jeans, a padded jacket and some Chinese army boots.

Ähmät tended the fire, raking the fierce embers in his tandoor oven, which was set into a platform outside a tiny workshop. Inside, his wife and sister rolled the dough into large rounds, and pricked a pattern into it with a gadget made from chicken's quills. They smeared each round with mashed onion and oil, and flipped it, upside-down, on to a padded cushion. Ähmät then thrust the cushion into the oven, and pressed the dough on to its heated wall. Ten minutes later, when he hooked it out, the bread was a ravishing golden brown, patterned elaborately with quill-pricks and morsels of roasted onion.</div>

It is used in wedding ceremonies, where the imam invites the bride and groom to share a piece of nan dipped in salted water as a sign of their intended fidelity. It is also part of the visible landscape of the region. As you drive through the countryside, through irrigated fields lined with trees, and villages of adobe homes, there are bread-stalls at every turn. Sometimes a sleepy vendor sits behind a stack of half a dozen small nan; sometimes a stall is laden with dozens of flatbreads of different shapes and sizes. There are large nan the size of dinner plates; small nan like bagels with the hole filled in; shiny glazed nan; nan scattered with sesame seeds or onion; greenish nan made from dough mixed with chopped Chinese chives; sweet nan sprinkled with sugar and chopped nuts or seeds. The nan is a bread with many uses. It can serve as an edible platter for kebabs or juicy steamed dumplings; or be used to wrap food for a takeaway. It is eminently portable -- perfect for a long, gruelling trip across the desert.</div>

The museum in the regional capital, Ürümchi, displays fragments of an actual nan from the eighth century, which looks very like those baked in Kashgar today. The Uyghur still treat their everyday bread with reverence. They never throw it away: even stale bread can be resurrected by a dipping in tea. One afternoon, as I walked through an avenue of poplars on the outskirts of Kashgar, a very old lady came up to me and clasped my hands in greeting.

No one had ever heard of such a thing. Although you see camels grazing in the foothills of the Pamirs, to the south of Kashgar, the ubiquitous meat of Xinjiang is the fat-tailed sheep, also prized by the Iranians and other Central Asians. Outside every kebab shop and butcher's stall in the region, sheep carcasses hang, their football-sized lumps of tail-fat obscenely exposed.

Would there be anything left of the old Uyghur town the next time I visited, I wondered? There were no Chinese guests at the wedding, of course: there is little social intercourse between the Uyghur and the Han. Many Chinese people dismiss the Uyghur as luo hou, 'backward', that most damning of Chinese adjectives. 'Filthy as hell,' said one Chinese man who gave me a lift in his car, of the Uyghur, 'They don't know anything about hygiene.'

But in Xinjiang, I saw what it was like to be a poor 'barbarian', without the weird kudos of an early industrial revolution and the victorious opium wars, without the glamour-by-association of the American Dream.

There was nan bread, with sugary preserves made from local apricots and shredded carrot; deep-fried dough twists dredged in sugar; crisp, flaky pancakes the texture of pappadoms; all kinds of sweet biscuits cut into ornamental shapes; and a silver tray of dishes filled with tiny almonds, dried jujubes, sultanas and paper-wrapped sweets. We chatted happily about the life and customs of the Uyghur and the British. But then I asked an innocent question about family size, a sensitive issue in China's minority regions, and Ali thought I was straying into political matters. He froze instantly, and the atmosphere did not recover.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that evening, as I wandered with my camera among the pool tables and snack stalls of the Kashgar nightmarket, I was shadowed by a secret policeman, who spoke both Uyghur and English. 'Hello, pleased to meet you,' he said with feigned warmth (his eyes hard, unsmiling), before interrogating me about my travel plans. 'Where have you come from, where are you staying, where are you going, are you working for a newspaper…?' I was deliberately vague in all my replies.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the Chinese, of course, pork is the staple meat. They eat it on its own or stir-fried with vegetables, they wrap it into dumplings, they use its bones for stock and its fat to flavour almost everything they eat. When the Chinese say 'meat', they mean 'pork' unless otherwise specified. To the Uyghur, as Muslims, the mere idea of eating pork is abhorrent. One taxi driver, cocooned with me in the privacy of his cab, assured me that 'if a true Muslim eats pork, his skin will erupt into blood-spouting boils that can be fatal'. Others spat out that old adage about the Chinese 'eating everything' with expressions of visceral disgust.</div>

'In the eighties, there were more sensitive policies on ethnic minorities,' a teacher told me, 'and Han Chinese had to be discreet about their consumption of pork. It was actually illegal to display it in shops or markets, and anyway they would not have dared to flaunt it, because they knew they would be beaten up or knifed immediately.

During the Cultural Revolution, Chinese Muslims were reportedly forced to eat pork and to drink water from wells contaminated by pigs.

Violent clashes between Muslims and Han Chinese in 2000 were sparked off by the hanging of a pig's head outside a mosque.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Muslim taboo on pork reinforces strong social divisions between Uyghur and Han. Most Uyghurs won't patronise Chinese restaurants, even those that claim to serve food prepared in accordance with Muslim dietary laws. 'You can't trust the Chinese not to use any pork products, whatever they say,' a Uyghur shopkeeper told me. As for the Han Chinese, they tend to see Uyghur restaurants as dirty.

<div class="line_en">As the days drifted by, I found myself developing an unexpected aversion to pork. Perhaps it was all those taxi-drivers, ranting about the omnivorous Chinese, filling my head with visions of pustules and sickness, but I couldn't bring myself to go into Han Chinese restaurants. They started to acquire the dangerous aura of the early English Chinatowns: dark, mysterious, risky places, where you might end up drugged or abducted. Chinese butchers' shops reeked of rapacious carnivorousness, perhaps even cannibalism (those Chinese eat anything). If I ate pork myself, would the Uyghur be able to sense it, just as the Chinese say they can sniff out a dairy-eater in a crowd, from the smell of her sweat?</div>

<div class="line_en">So I stopped eating pork. Except for once, in Khotan, on the Southern Silk Road. Magnificent though the Uyghur traditional foods were -- those delightful noodles, rich polos, crisp nans and spicy kebabs -- after a few weeks they were becoming a little repetitive for a European barbarian nurtured on the 'hundred dishes, hundred flavours' variety of Sichuanese cuisine. Like most travellers to Xinjiang and Tibet, I had found myself starting to dislike the Chinese, but I was still fantasising about their food. So one night I stole into an upmarket Chinese restaurant in the new part of Khotan. The food was stupendously good: the roast pork, the stir-fried duck, the sizzling chives… It was clearly a place for serious Chinese gourmets, aimed at wealthy jade dealers and local officials. Guiltily, I had to admit that it was the finest meal of the trip. But it left a bad taste in my conscience, a kind of rancid, oily shame.</div>

<div class="line_en">While I watched, Qurban filled the bags with a pale starchy liquid. As the liquid sloshed through the windpipes, the lungs themselves hissed gently and began to expand. They blew up extravagantly as Qurban filled them with almost unbelievable amounts of liquid. After the lungs had quadrupled in size and looked fit to burst, he bound the windpipes tightly with pieces of cloth.

The scene in their outhouse on the morning I visited resembled a surrealist installation.

But while the region is famous for its fruit in general, it is the pomegranate that has the strongest resonance in Kashgar. In the shady carpet shops around the Idkah mosque, it appears as a motif, woven into the intricate patterning of the local rugs.
