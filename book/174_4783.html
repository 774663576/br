<div class="line_en">It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and second mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars (sailors) before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle. Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for the mainland.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, "Don't be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children." So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to (bet on) that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船上的事且搁下不提，我们现在先回过头来看看那个寂寞的家庭。我们的三个角色无情地离家出走，已经很久了。说也惭愧，这么长的时间，我们没有提起十四号这所住宅了。不过我们敢说，达林太大一定不会见怪的。假如我们早一点回到这里，带着悲哀的同情探望她，她或许会喊道：“别做傻事，我有什么要紧？快回去照顾孩子们吧。”母亲们既然总是抱这种态度，那就难怪孩子们都利用她们的弱点，借故迟迟不回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and the dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin (one person after another, as they had to Cpt. Hook). Instant obedience was the only safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some of Hook's wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们当中，有些人愿意这船是一艘规规矩矩的船，另一些人则愿意它仍是一艘海盗船。可是，船长把他们看成喽罗们，所以，他们不敢发表意见，即使是递交一份陈情书也不敢。绝对服从是唯一稳妥的办法。斯莱特利有一次奉命测水，脸上露出迷惑的神色，就挨了十二下打。大家普遍感到，彼得眼下故作老实，为的是消除温迪的怀疑；不过，等到新衣做成之后，或许还会有变化。这件衣服，是用胡克一件最邪恶的海盗服改做的，温迪本不愿意做。后来，大家窃窃私议，在彼得穿上这件衣裳的头一夜，他在舱里坐了很久，嘴里衔着胡克的烟袋，一手握拳，只伸出了食指；这根食指弯曲着，像只钩子，举得老高，作出恐吓的姿态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They have been planning it out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, Nana's leap through the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, "Dash it all, here are those boys again." However, we should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一件事我实在想做，像一般写故事的人那样。那就是，告诉达林太太，孩子们就要回来了，下礼拜四他们就会到家。这样一来，温迪、约翰和迈克尔预订的给家里一个意外的惊喜的计划，就完全落空了。他们在船上已经计划好：母亲的狂喜，父亲的欢呼，娜娜腾空跃起，抢先扑上来拥抱他们；而他们准备要做的，是秘而不宣。预先把消息泄露出来，破坏他们的计划，那该多么痛快。那样的话，当他们神气地走进家门时，达林太太甚至都不去亲吻温迪；达林先生会烦躁地嚷道：“真讨厌，这些小子们又回来了。”不过，这样做，我们也得不到感谢。我们现在已经了解达林太太的为人了，可以肯定，她准会责怪我们，不该剥夺孩子们的一点小小的乐趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使我们现在冒昧地走进那间熟悉的育儿室，那也只是因为，它的合法主人已经在归途中；我们只不过比他们先行一步，看看他们的被褥是不是都晾过了，关照达林先生太太那晚不要出门。我们不过是仆人罢了。不过，既然他们离开时走得那样匆忙，连句感谢的话都不说，我们又何必替他们晾被褥呢？要是他们回到家里，发见父母都到乡间度周末去了，那不是活该受报应吗？这是从我们和他们相识以来，他们应得的教训。不过，如果我们把事情设想成这样，达林太太永远也不会饶恕我们的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of them will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never leaves the house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of them will hurt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你瞧，这女人的情绪不对头。我本想替她美言几句，可我现在瞧不起她，不想再提孩子们的事了。其实，我用不着关照达林太太安排好一切，一切都已安排好了。三张床上的被褥都晾过了，她也从不出门；请看，窗子是开着的。尽管我们可以留下为她效劳，但我们还是不如回到船上去。不过，我们既然来了，就不妨留下观察观察。我们本来就是旁观者嘛，没有人真正需要我们。所以就让我们在一旁观望，说几句刺耳的话，好叫某些人听了不痛快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed be might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling's dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:</div>

<div class="line_en">Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, which conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way at six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he must have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天早晨，达林先生坐在狗窝里，叫人连窝一起给抬到车上，拉到办公室。六点钟，再照样运回家。我们要记住，这个人把邻居的意见看得多么重，那么我们就可以看出，他的性格有多么坚强。现在，这个人的一举一动，都引起了人们惊诧的注意。他内心一定忍受着极大的痛苦；但是当小伙子们指点着他的小屋子说三道四时，他外表还能保持镇静。要是有哪位太太探头向狗舍里张望，他还总是向她脱帽致意。">查看中文翻译</div>

Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won't be able to say nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children, she couldn't help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are on the way. Let's.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink, "It's Wendy's mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得并不觉得这样做有什么不对，反而开心地跳起舞来；然后，他向游戏室里偷偷张望，看是谁在弹钢琴。他轻轻地对叮叮铃说：“那是温迪的母亲。她是一位漂亮的太太，不过没有我母亲漂亮。她嘴上满是顶针，不过没有我母亲嘴上的顶针多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="彼得不知钢琴上弹的是什么曲子，那其实是“可爱的家庭”；可是他知道，那曲子在不断地唱着“回来吧，温迪，温迪，温迪”。彼得洋洋得意地说：“太太，你再也别想见到温迪啦，因为窗子已经闩上啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quick Tink," he whipered, "close the window; bar it! That's right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me."</div>
