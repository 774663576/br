<div class="line_en">Long and low, without towers or windows, it coiled like a stone serpent through a grove of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the Qartheen called shade of the evening. No other buildings stood near. Black tiles covered the palace roof, many fallen or broken; the mortar between the stones was dry and crumbling. She understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called it the Palace of Dust. Even Drogon seemed disquieted by the sight of it. The black dragon hissed, smoke seeping out between his sharp teeth. "Blood of my blood," Jhogo said in Dothraki, "this is an evil place, a haunt of ghosts and maegi. See how it drinks the morning sun? Let us go before it drinks us as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am no child." Dany took his arm nonetheless. It was darker than she would have thought under the black trees, and the way was longer. Though the path seemed to run straight from the street to the door of the palace, Pyat Pree soon turned aside. When she questioned him, the warlock said only, "The front way leads in, but never out again. Heed my words, my queen. The House of the Undying Ones was not made for mortal men. If you value your soul, take care and do just as I tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是孩子。”但丹妮还是挽住了他的手。黑树林比她想像中更黑暗，路也比她想像中更漫长。大路从街道直通宫殿大门，但俳雅·菩厉很快走上岔道，她询问缘故，男巫道：“前门之路有进无出。注意听我说话，女王陛下。不朽之殿非为凡人所建。若您珍惜灵魂，请谨遵吾言，格外小心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they reached the door -- a tall oval mouth, set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of a human face -- the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold. He stood no higher than her knee, his faced pinched and pointed, snoutish, but he was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue, and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray. Upon it rested a slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid: shade of the evening, the wine of warlocks. "Take and drink," urged Pyat Pree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们来到门前——那是一张椭圆的大嘴，嵌在一堵人脸形状的墙上——一位丹妮毕生所见最矮的侏儒正等在门口，身高还不到她的膝盖，脸皱巴巴地挤成一团，鼻子则高得出奇。他穿着紫蓝相间的华丽服饰，粉红小手中托着一个银盘，上面放了一只细长的水晶杯，内盛浓稠的蓝液。这便是夜影之水，男巫的美酒。“喝吧，”俳雅·菩厉催促。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany raised the glass to her lips. The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother's milk and Drogo's seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them… and then the glass was empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮举杯至唇。呷第一口的滋味就像混合墨汁的腐肉，恶心无比，但当她吞咽而下，它却在她体内活动起来。一丝丝卷须在胸中扩散，仿佛烈焰缠绕心脏，舌尖则油然而生蜂蜜、茴香和奶油的味道，既像母亲的乳汁和卓戈的精液，也像鲜红的肉、温热的血和熔化的金。它尝起来有她所知的一切滋味，却又非其中任何一种…随后杯子就空了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The second room was a twin to the first. Again she turned to the right-hand door. When she pushed it open she faced yet another small antechamber with four doors. I am in the presence of sorcery.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now you may enter," said the warlock. Dany put the glass back on the servitor's tray, and went inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mold-eaten carpet under her feet had once been gorgeously colored, and whorls of gold could still be seen in the fabric, glinting broken amidst the faded grey and mottled green. What remained served to muffle her footfalls, but that was not all to the good. Dany could hear sounds within the walls, a faint scurrying and scrabbling that made her think of rats. Drogon heard them too. His head moved as he followed the sounds, and when they stopped he gave an angry scream. Other sounds, even more disturbing, came through some of the closed doors. One shook and thumped, as if someone were trying to break through. From another came a dissonant piping that made the dragon lash his tail wildly from side to side. Dany hurried quickly past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脚下发霉的地毯曾经华美艳丽，织物上的金纹装饰隐约可见，在暗淡的灰色与斑驳的绿色之间断续地闪烁光芒。这残破的地毯吸收了她的脚步声，却不能屏蔽其他声音。丹妮听到墙内有响动，那是一种细小而忙乱的抓刨，让她想到了老鼠。卓耿也听见了，它的脑袋跟着声音转动，当声音停止，便发出恼怒的尖叫。更令人不安的声音从一些紧闭的门后传出，其中一扇被撞得摇晃，仿佛有人要破门而出，另一扇后面传来刺耳的笛声，龙一听之下便疯狂地摇尾巴。丹妮赶紧快跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fourth room was oval rather than square and walled in wormeaten wood in place of stone. Six passages led out from it in place of four. Dany chose the rightmost, and entered a long, dim, high-ceilinged hall. Along the right hand was a row of torches burning with a smoky orange light, but the only doors were to her left. Drogon unfolded wide black wings and beat the stale air. He flew twenty feet before thudding to an undignified crash. Dany strode after him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第四个房间不是方形，而是椭圆形，墙壁也不再是石头，而是虫蛀的木板。它有六个出口而不只四个。丹妮照旧选了最右边那个，进入一条长而昏暗的走廊。天花板很高，右边是一排冒烟燃烧的火炬，发出橙色的光芒，但所有的门都在左边。卓耿展开宽阔的黑翼，扇动陈腐的空气。它飞了二十尺，突然“砰”的一声，狼狈地栽下来。丹妮大步跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She fled from him, but only as far as the next open door. I know this room, she thought. She remembered those great wooden beams and the carved animal faces that adorned them. And there outside the window, a lemon tree! The sight of it made her heart ache with longing. It is the house with the red door, the house in Braavos. No sooner had she thought it than old Ser Willem came into the room, leaning heavily on his stick. "Little princess, there you are," he said in his gruff kind voice. "Come," he said, "come to me, my lady, you're home now, you're safe now." His big wrinkled hand reached for her, soft as old leather, and Dany wanted to take it and hold it and kiss it, she wanted that as much as she had ever wanted anything. Her foot edged forward, and then she thought, He's dead, he's dead, the sweet old bear, he died a long time ago. She backed away and ran.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从他面前逃开，随即在下一扇门前停步。我认得这扇门，她心想。她记得那些雕刻着栩栩如生的动物脸庞的巨大木梁，还有窗外那棵柠檬树！眼前的景象令她既向往又心痛。这是那栋红漆大门的房子，是她在布拉佛斯的家。这时，老威廉爵士倚着拐杖沉重地走出来。“小公主，您回来了啊，”他的声音沙哑而慈蔼，“过来，”他说，“到我这里来，我的小姐，您到家了，安全了。”他皱巴巴的大手朝她伸来，如旧皮革一般柔软，丹妮想抓住它，握紧它，亲吻它，仿佛那是她一生中最大的愿望。于是她缓缓向前挪去，接着突然想到：他死了，他死了，亲切而魁梧的老人，他很早以前就死了。她往后退却，赶紧跑开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men crawled over her. They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands, like the servitor who had brought her the glass of shade. One was pumping between her thighs. Another savaged her breasts, worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth, tearing and chewing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一个房间，有位美女展开四肢，赤裸裸躺在地上。四个小人趴在她身上，他们有老鼠一样的尖脸和粉红小手，跟夜影之水的仆人一样。其中一个在她股间抽送，另一个在摧残她的胸部，把乳头放进潮湿红润的嘴里撕扯咀嚼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Farther on she came upon a feast of corpses. Savagely slaughtered, the feasters lay strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables, asprawl in pools of congealing blood. Some had lost limbs, even heads. Severed hands clutched bloody cups, wooden spoons, roast fowl, heels of bread. In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a wolf. He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a scepter, and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往前，她见到一场死尸的盛宴。参与者都是遭到残忍屠杀后的尸体，它们东倒西歪地趴在倾倒的椅子和劈烂的高架桌边，躺在一滩滩正在凝结的血液中。有人断手断脚，有人失去头颅。无主的手掌紧握着血淋淋的杯子、木勺、烤鸭和面包。上方的王座坐着一个狼头死人，戴一顶铁冠，握一条羊腿，好似国王握着权杖。他的眼神紧随丹妮，仿佛在无声地控诉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother's hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. "Aegon," he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. "What better name for a king?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她再次停下，第一个念头是：那是韦赛里斯！但仔细一看，却发现不是。那人有哥哥的头发，却比哥哥高大，眼睛靛蓝，而非淡紫。“就叫他伊耿，”他对大木床上正为新生婴儿哺乳的女人说。“对君王而言，这不是最好的名字吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The long hall went on and on and on, with endless doors to her left and only torches to her right. She ran past more doors than she could count, closed doors and open ones, doors of wood and doors of iron, carved doors and plain ones, doors with pulls and doors with locks and doors with knockers. Drogon lashed against her back, urging her on, and Dany ran until she could run no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长廊一直往前延伸、延伸，左边是无穷无尽的门，右边只有火炬。她不知跑过多少门，其中有的关闭有的开启，有木门也有铁门，有的门雕刻精细，有的则很普通，有的门带把手，有的则是锁或门环。卓耿用翅膀抽打她的背，催促她前进。丹妮一直奔跑，直到喘不过气来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left, grander than the rest. They swung open as she neared, and she had to stop and look. Beyond loomed a cavernous stone hall, the largest she had ever seen. The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls. Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with dark eyes and long silver-grey hair. "Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat," he said to a man below him. "Let him be the king of ashes." Drogon shrieked, his claws digging through silk and skin, but the king on his throne never heard, and Dany moved on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，一对巨大的青铜门出现在左边，比其他所有门都宏伟。随着她走近，门自动打开，她不由得驻足观看。门内是她这辈子所见最大的石殿，高墙上挂着众多死龙的头颅，冷冷地俯瞰下方。一位华服老者坐在一个高耸而多刺的王座上，眼神暗淡，头发银灰。“让我君临焦黑骨骸和烤熟血肉，”他对下面一个男人说，“让我成为灰烬之王。”卓耿尖声嘶叫，爪子嵌入丝绸和肌肤，但王座上的国王充耳不闻，于是丹妮继续前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He has a song," the man replied. "He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire." He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany's, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. "There must be one more," he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. "The dragon has three heads." He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他已经有了一首歌，”男人答。“他就是预言中的王子，他的歌便是冰与火之歌。”他边说边抬起头，视线与丹妮交汇，仿佛看到了门外的她。“还有一个，”他说，她不知他是对她还是对床上的女人讲话，“龙有三个头。”他走到窗边座位，拿起一把竖琴，用手指轻轻拨弄银弦。忧郁而甜美的音乐充满房间，男人、妻子和婴儿如晨雾一般消退。乐声徘徊，催促她赶紧离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed as though she walked for another hour before the long hall finally ended in a steep stone stair, descending into darkness. Every door, open or closed, had been to her left. Dany looked back behind her. The torches were going out, she realized with a start of fear. Perhaps twenty still burned. Thirty at most. One more guttered out even as she watched, and the darkness came a little farther down the hall, creeping toward her. And as she listened it seemed as if she heard something else coming, shuffling and dragging itself slowly along the faded carpet. Terror filled her. She could not go back and she was afraid to stay here, but how could she go on? There was no door on her right, and the steps went down, not up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好似又走了一个钟头，长廊终于到了尽头，眼前是一道陡峭的石梯，向下直通黑暗。丹妮回望身后，每一扇门，不论开着还是关闭，都在她的左边。同时，她惊恐地意识到，火炬正依次熄灭。只剩二十支在燃烧。最多三十支。就在观望期间，又有一支熄灭。无声无息的黑暗，沿着长廊步步进逼。她凝神倾听，似乎还有别的东西拖着沉重的步伐，沿着褪色的地毯，缓缓走来。她心中充满恐惧。她不能回头，留在这里危机四伏，可要如何前进呢？右边没有门，楼梯则往下，不是往上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. Drogon's long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream, steam rising from between his teeth. He hears it too. Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was nothing. Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see? Another torch went out. Another. The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the right…</div>

The blood of the dragon must not be afraid. Dany said a quick prayer, begging the Warrior for courage and the Dothraki horse god for strength. She made herself walk forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">A long stone table filled this room. Above it floated a human heart, swollen and blue with corruption, yet still alive. It beat, a deep ponderous throb of sound, and each pulse sent out a wash of indigo light. The figures around the table were no more than blue shadows. As Dany walked to the empty chair at the foot of the table, they did not stir, nor speak, nor turn to face her. There was no sound but the slow, deep beat of the rotting heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">Through the indigo murk, she could make out the wizened features of the Undying One to her right, an old old man, wrinkled and hairless. His flesh was a ripe violet-blue, his lips and nails bluer still, so dark they were almost black. Even the whites of his eyes were blue. They stared unseeing at the ancient woman on the opposite side of the table, whose gown of pale silk had rotted on her body. One withered breast was left bare in the Qartheen manner, to show a pointed blue nipple hard as leather.</div>

<div class="line_en">… mother of dragons… came a voice, part whisper and part moan… dragons… dragons… dragons… other voices echoed in the gloom. Some were male and some female. One spoke with the timbre of a child. The floating heart pulsed from dimness to darkness. It was hard to summon the will to speak, to recall the words she had practiced so assiduously. "I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros." Do they hear me? Why don't they move? She sat, folding her hands in her lap. "Grant me your counsel, and speak to me with the wisdom of those who have conquered death."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name… mother of dragons, daughter of death… Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire… mother of dragons, slayer of lies… Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly.

<div class="line_en">Faster and faster the visions came, one after the other, until it seemed as if the very air had come alive. Shadows whirled and danced inside a tent, boneless and terrible. A little girl ran barefoot toward a big house with a red door. Mirri Maz Duur shrieked in the flames, a dragon bursting from her brow. Behind a silver horse the bloody corpse of a naked man bounced and dragged. A white lion ran through grass taller than a man. Beneath the Mother of Mountains, a line of naked crones crept from a great lake and knelt shivering before her, their grey heads bowed. Ten thousand slaves lifted bloodstained hands as she raced by on her silver, riding like the wind. "Mother!" they cried. "Mother, mother!" They were reaching for her, touching her, tugging at her cloak, the hem of her skirt, her foot, her leg, her breast. They wanted her, needed her, the fire, the life, and Dany gasped and opened her arms to give herself to them…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="影像出现得越来越快，一个紧接着一个，仿佛空气有了生命。影子在帐篷里盘旋跳舞，飘逸不定，可怖骇人。一个小女孩光脚奔向一座红门的大宅。弥丽·马兹·笃尔在火焰中尖叫，一条龙从她额头进出。银马拖着一具血淋淋的赤裸男尸，在崎岖的地面弹跳。一头白狮在比人高的草丛中奔跑。圣母山下，一行赤裸的老妪从大湖中走出，颤抖着跪在她面前，低下灰色的头颅。一万名奴隶高举血手，她骑在银马上，风一般飞驰而过。“母亲！”他们高喊，“母亲！母亲！”他们挤到她身边，触摸她，拉她的披风和裙边，拉她的脚、她的腿、她的胸。他们爱她，他们要她，他们需要火和生命，于是丹妮喘着气张开双臂将自己交出…">查看中文翻译</div>

The Undying were all around her, blue and cold, whispering as they reached for her, pulling, stroking, tugging at her clothes, touching her with their dry cold hands, twining their fingers through her hair. All the strength had left her limbs. She could not move. Even her heart had ceased to beat. She felt a hand on her bare breast, twisting her nipple. Teeth found the soft skin of her throat. A mouth descended on one eye, licking, sucking, biting…</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside a long dim passageway stretched serpentine before her, lit by the flickering orange glare from behind. Dany ran, searching for a door, a door to her right, a door to her left, any door, but there was nothing, only twisty stone walls, and a floor that seemed to move slowly under her feet, writhing as if to trip her.

<div class="line_en">Then indigo turned to orange, and whispers turned to screams. Her heart was pounding, racing, the hands and mouths were gone, heat washed over her skin, and Dany blinked at a sudden glare. Perched above her, the dragon spread his wings and tore at the terrible dark heart, ripping the rotten flesh to ribbons, and when his head snapped forward, fire flew from his open jaws, bright and hot. She could hear the shrieks of the Undying as they burned, their high thin papery voices crying out in tongues long dead. Their flesh was crumbling parchment, their bones dry wood soaked in tallow. They danced as the flames consumed them; they staggered and writhed and spun and raised blazing hands on high, their fingers bright as torches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，靛蓝变成橙红，低语化为尖叫。她的心怦怦飞跳，抓她的手脚陡然消失，一股热气冲刷肌肤。突如其来的强光令丹妮眯起眼睛。只见龙在上方，展开翅膀，撕扯那颗可怕的黑心脏，将腐肉撕成条条碎片。它的头猛地前伸，嘴里喷出火焰，明亮而炽热。她听见不朽者燃烧时发出的尖叫，他们用早已消失的语言呼喊，尖细的高音如薄纸一般。他们的血肉像羊皮纸一样碎裂，骨头如浸泡在油脂中的枯木。他们手舞足蹈，被火焰吞噬；他们跌跌撞撞，翻腾扭转，高举燃烧的手，指头像火炬一样明亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
