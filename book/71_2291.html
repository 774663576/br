<div class="line_en">From the ground-floor rooms one could hear the blast of music and the swirling of the waltz and the gallop, while sharp bands of light shone out through the slats of the persian blinds. The garden, for the time being, was solely the province of a dozen or so servants, who had just been ordered to lay out the supper by their mistress, who was reassured at seeing the steady improvement in the weather. Until then, she had been unsure whether to eat in the dining-room or under a long canvas awning, set up above the lawn. But this lovely blue sky, full of stars, had now settled the issue in favour of the awning and the lawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">The garden paths were lit by coloured lamps, as is the custom in Italy, and the supper table was laden with candles and flowers, as is the custom in all countries where they understand how to dress a table, which when properly done is the rarest of all luxuries.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hottest days of July had come when the calendar arrived at the Saturday appointed for M. de Morcerf's ball. It was ten o'clock in the evening. The large trees in the count's garden were sharply outlined against a sky across which drifted the last tufts of cloud from the storm that had been threatening all day, to reveal an azure field sprinkled with golden stars.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mme Danglars had been so deeply disturbed by the events we have described that she was reluctant to attend; but that morning her carriage had crossed Villefort's. The latter signalled to her, the two carriages pulled up alongside each other and the crown prosecutor said, through the window: "You are going to Madame de Morcerf's, I suppose?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓格拉司夫人本来有点不想到马瑟夫夫人那儿去，因为我们前面所叙述的几件事情使她感到很烦恼，但那天早晨，她的马车碰巧在路上和维尔福先生的马车相遇。后者作了一个手势，于是两部马车并了拢来，他说：“马瑟夫夫人那儿您去不去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just as the Countess de Morcerf had given her last orders and was returning indoors, the drawing-rooms began to fill with guests, attracted more by the countess's charming hospitality than by the distinguished position of the count. Everyone knew in advance that the party would supply them with some details which would either be worth relating or, in the event, copying, thanks to Mercédès' good taste.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马瑟夫伯爵夫人吩咐过仆人以后，又回到屋里去，这时正巧来了许多宾客，吸引他们来的多半不是由于伯爵的地位崇高，而是由于伯爵夫人的款待有趣——因为由于美茜蒂丝的风格高雅，你一定可以在她的宴会上找到一些值得叙述，或甚至在需要的时候值得模仿的布置方法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the two carriages had continued on their separate ways. However, Mme Danglars did come, looking beautiful not only with her own beauty, but dressed with dazzling extravagance. She was just coming in through one door when Mercédès entered by the other. The countess sent Albert to greet Mme Danglars, and he came forward, offered the baroness some well-deserved compliments on her dress and took her arm to lead her wherever she wanted to go. At the same time, he looked around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是两部马车又向它们不同的目的地前进。所以邓格拉司夫人来了。她不但人长得美，而且服饰也华丽动人；她从一扇门进来，美茜蒂丝正好也从另一扇门出现。伯爵夫人派阿尔培去迎接邓格拉司夫人。他走上前去，对她的打扮讲了几句恰如其分的恭维话，然后让她挽住他的手臂引她入座。阿尔培向四周观望。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Madame," he said, "I have the honour to introduce Monsieur Maximilien Morrel, captain of spahis, one of our fine and, most of all, brave officers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，一个眼睛明亮、头发乌黑、髭须光润的漂亮的青年过来向维尔福夫人恭恭敬敬地鞠了一躬。阿尔培和他握握手。“夫人，”阿尔培说，“允许我向您介绍玛西米兰·摩莱尔先生，驻阿尔及利亚的骑兵上尉，是我们最出色、最勇敢的军官之一。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman in Auteuil at the Count of Monte Cristo's," Mme de Villefort replied, turning away with distinct coldness. This reply and, most of all, the tone in which it was delivered wrung poor Morrel's heart; but a consolation was in store. Turning around, he saw a beautiful, pale face in the doorway, its wide and apparently expressionless eyes fixed on him, while the bouquet of forget-me-nots was raised to its lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我已经有幸在阿都尔基督山伯爵的家里会过这位先生了。”维尔福夫人回答，带着显然很冷淡的态度转身就走。这句答语，尤其是说这句活的那种口吻，浇冷了可怜的摩莱尔的心。但一种报偿正在等候他。他转过身来，在门边看到一张美丽的白面孔，白面孔上的那一对蓝色大眼睛正凝视着他，那对眼睛里并没有什么明显的表情，但她手里的那一束毋忘我花却已慢慢地举到她的唇边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, it is only right and proper to let him know. I shall certainly do it as soon as he arrives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末应该发发慈悲心去通知他。他来的时候，我一定这样做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This greeting was well enough understood by Morrel for him to lift his handkerchief to his mouth, though with the same blank expression on his face. These two living statues, whose hearts were beating so rapidly despite the marble calm of their faces, separated from one another by the whole length of the room, momentarily forgot themselves; or, rather, momentarily forgot everyone else in their silent contemplation of one another. Indeed, they could have remained for a long time in this way, lost in each other, without anyone noticing their total self-absorption: the Count of Monte Cristo had just come in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种致敬的姿势摩莱尔懂得很清楚，他的眼睛里也含着同样的表情，把他的手帕举到嘴唇上。于是这两尊活的石像，隔着整个房间的距离，默默地互相凝视着，一时忘掉了他们自己，甚至忘掉了世界，但在他们那种大理石似的外表底下，他们的心却在猛烈地狂跳。他们本来即使互相再多呆望很多时候，也不会有人注意到他们的出神状态——因为基督山伯爵刚进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There may have been more handsome men, but there was surely none more significant, if we may be allowed to use the word. Everything about the count meant something and carried some weight; for the habit of positive thought had given to his features, to the expression on his face and to the least of his gestures an incomparable strength and suppleness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比他更漂亮的人或许还有很多，但没有哪一个人的面貌比他更有“意义”，假如可以用“意义”这两个字来形容表情的话。伯爵身上的每一件东西似乎都有其意义，因为他已获得了经常不断地思想的习惯，所以无关紧要的动作，也会在他的脸上表示出无比的精明和刚强。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we have already mentioned, either because of some imagined aura or because of his natural presence, he attracted attention wherever he went. It was not his black coat, superbly though it was cut, simple and without decoration; it was not his plain white waistcoat; nor was it his trousers, fitting over a delicately shaped foot, that attracted attention. It was his dark complexion, his wavy black hair, his pure, calm face, his deep and melancholy eye and, finally, his exquisitely formed mouth which could so easily adopt an expression of sovereign contempt, which drew all eyes to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">However it may be, he came forward, running the gauntlet of stares and cursory greetings, towards Mme de Morcerf who, standing in front of the mantelpiece, had observed his entrance in a mirror facing the doorway and was getting ready to receive him. She consequently turned around with a well-judged smile at the very moment when he bowed in front of her. Doubtless she thought that the count would say something; and doubtless, on his side, he was expecting her to address him. But both remained silent, each surely feeling that a mere commonplace would be unworthy of them, and, after they had exchanged these silent salutations, Monte Cristo turned and began to walk towards Albert, who came to greet him with hand outstretched.</div>
