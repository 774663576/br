<div class="line_en">The helicopter comes for us at midday. Aboard are two Twelve paramilitaries, both carrying sidearms. They jump down onto the platform, carry out a thorough search of the entire installation, nod cursorily at Nobby and Ginge, and shepherd us on board the Super Puma. As we swing away into the wind I peer downwards, suddenly fearful that Anton's body will appear, arms outstretched, borne up by the choppy waves. But there's nothing, no accusing corpse, only the diminishing figures of Nobby and Ginge on the platform, and the gray wastes of the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When faced by danger, Oxana and I are polar opposites. I foresee terrible outcomes, and become possessed by fear, while Oxana's sense of impending threat is so shallow as to barely register. As her body prepares itself for action, her mind remains calm. It must be the same for Charlie, who lounges back in their seat, chewing gum that they've somehow extracted from the soldiers, and studiously ignores us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Ostend, the two men keep us on a short rein, fast-tracking us through security and passport control and marching us out onto the tarmac, where the Learjet is fueled up and waiting. I squeeze Oxana's hand as we take off, and keep hold of it. Our destination, as expected, is Moscow. The engine noise is little more than a discreet hum, but I'm too nervous to talk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Scared or not, I proceed with my plan. After breakfast on the platform I surreptitiously tore a small blank strip from a page of Birds of the North Sea and glued it into the back of my passport, using a couple of dabs of honey. Now, as soon as we're airborne, I take out my hard-won pencil and write, heading the message with the telephone number that I've memorized, and asking the person reading it to call the number urgently, on a matter of state security, and deliver the following message to General Tikhomirov: 2 shooters, this week, range 700m.</div>

<div class="line_en">Entering the airport buildings, we're fast-tracked through a small VIP customs hall. There are two officers, dressed in bulky green winter uniforms. An older woman with tiny, granite eyes, and a shaven-headed young man whose broad-brimmed cap is several sizes too large for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shortly before we begin our descent to Moscow, one of the paramilitaries collects our passports, securing them with an elastic band. We seem to circle the city forever, and as we go through landing and disembarkation procedures at Sheremetyevo I'm so terrified I almost vomit. If the paramilitary examines the passports, as he well may, that'll be the end. If I'm lucky, it'll be a bullet in the back of the head. I don't want to think of the alternatives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our paramilitary chaperone takes our passports from his pocket, removes the elastic band, and as he flicks through the pages of the top passport before passing it to the woman, I feel my knees begin to shake. I'm guessing that my face has gone white, because Oxana puts an arm round me and asks if I'm all right. I nod, and the other Twelve guy peers at me suspiciously. "Delayed reaction," I stammer. "Flying. I get very nervous."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Give them all to me," the granite-eyed woman orders. Her name tag identifies her as Lapotnikova, Inna. Taking the passports, she opens the first, looks up, and beckons Charlie to the counter. I'm second in line after Charlie. I watch Ms. Lapotnikova slowly page through the forgery, and come to a halt as she reaches the page with the note. She reads it expressionlessly, and slowly looks up at me, one eyebrow raised questioningly. I nod imperceptibly and she discreetly pulls out the note and returns my passport to me. Then handing the remaining three passports to her colleague, she unhurriedly leaves the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment I'm weak with relief, then it occurs to me that she may simply have gone to call airport security. Perhaps she thinks I'm some deranged conspiracy theorist. Either way, I'm finished. Under my suddenly too-hot clothes I feel a sweat bead running down my spine. I try to look casual and Oxana squeezes my hand. "Relax," she murmurs. "You look like you're trying not to shit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lapotnikova returns just as the customs officer in the big hat is handing back the last of the passports. She ignores me and returns to her seat. I want to hug her. We're through. I've done everything I can, the rest is up to Tikhomirov, although whether my message will be the slightest help to him, I don't know. I'm guessing not.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we approach central Moscow, we're forced to negotiate street barriers, road closures and diversions. "What's going on?" I ask the driver, as the traffic slows to a standstill.</div>

<div class="line_en">"New Year's Eve celebrations," he answers, irritably negotiating a three-point turn.</div>

<div class="line_en">We're driven back to Moscow in the same SUV, this time by one of our armed guards. The second guy sits in the passenger seat with his pistol in his lap, presumably in case one of us tries to filch it from its holster. I'm in the back seat, as usual, between Oxana and Charlie. The symbolism of this arrangement is not lost on Charlie, who stares pointedly out of the window for the entire journey. Oxana, kittenish at the prospect of action, creeps her fingers under my sweater and round my waist, tickling and pinching me.</div>

<div class="line_en">We're delivered back to the twelfth floor of the gray skyscraper and shown to our old rooms. I'm scared, in a generalized sort of way, but mostly I'm just very, very hungry. Whatever tomorrow holds, there's tonight's dinner to look forward to, followed by a night in a full-sized bed with Oxana. For now, that's enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">Below us, as dusk falls, Moscow lights up. The New Year decorations are in place, and the streets, cathedrals and skyscrapers are a blaze of gold and silver and sapphire. Gazing out of the window, I think how wonderful it would be to be able to explore the city with Oxana, unburdened with fear and horror and dreams of death, and lose ourselves in the dazzle and enchantment of it all.</div>

<div class="line_en">At dinner, Richard questions us closely about Anton. Charlie does most of the talking, explaining that the general consensus was that he'd been drinking late at night, and had fallen off the platform.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was like he always was. I never liked him that much but he was professional, and ran things properly. Everything was well organized, supplies, weaponry, all that. And then one morning he just wasn't there."</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day passes with stifling slowness. We're not permitted to leave the twelfth floor, or to do anything except pace around like zoo animals, breathing the building's recycled air. There are no books, no newspapers, no computers or phones. Oxana and I have temporarily run out of things to say to each other, and I spend most of the afternoon sleeping. After dinner Richard announces a film show, and we follow him into a projection room with a screen covering most of one wall. "It's not long, and there's no sound," he tells us, as we take our places. "But it's quite an eye-opener."</div>

<div class="line_en">Stechkin and Loy stand, place their empty tumblers on the mantelpiece, and shake hands. Loy then walks Stechkin to the door. The film cuts and then reprises from the same viewpoint with lower lighting as the door opens and three young women walk in. They're all blond, long-legged, and spectacular in a listless, stoned sort of way. Loy leans back in his chair, nods, and issues an order. The women undress, drape their clothes over the vacant armchair, and start kissing and caressing each other's breasts with much eye-rolling and simulated groaning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are no titles, just a recording date and a time code. Then a silent, wide-angle shot of a hotel suite from a fixed camera, almost certainly concealed. The quality of the film isn't great, but this is clearly a very upscale, thousands-of-dollars-a-night sort of place. The color scheme is parchment and oak, the curtains are ivory silk, the lighting is discreet. Two men in suits, holding whisky tumblers, sit in armchairs on either side of a marble fireplace. Both are immediately recognizable. One is Valery Stechkin, the president of Russia, the other is Ronald Loy, president of the United States. Both have the rouged, powdered look of the recently embalmed. A third man, with the watchful demeanor of a bodyguard, stands by a door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually we're treated to the full three-way performance. It's pretty dispiriting. Loy doesn't join in, but sits back in his chair, his expression disdainful. When one of the women experimentally waggles a glistening strap-on in front of his nose, he responds irritably, batting it away with a tiny, childlike hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">The film cuts to a bedroom furnished in the same rich, fustian colors. The bed itself is enormous and covered in gold damask. The three women walk into the shot, followed by Loy. He orders them to climb onto the bed, where they bounce up and down in a desultory fashion before coming to a halt, crouching down, and as one, beginning to urinate onto the gold coverlet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From his chair, Loy stares at the women through narrowed eyes, as if watching them was a wearisome but essential presidential duty. Halfway through the process, one of the women overbalances on her high heels and tips forward, sliding off the bed in a torrent of piss.</div>

That short clip has had a greater impact on world history than any political event, debate or policy decision in the last decade. Holding this trump card, this kompromat, has enabled Stechkin to steer the White House as he chooses. Not just to steer it but to throw it into a catastrophic reverse. Meanwhile the Russian Federation over which he presides like a latter-day Roman emperor is sclerotic and corrupt to the core.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm telling you this because I want you to believe in what we, here, are trying to achieve. The new world we dream of will not be brought about by democratic process, that dream is dead.
