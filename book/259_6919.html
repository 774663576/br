<div class="line_en">At the cemetery, Morrie watched as they shoveled dirt into his mother's grave. He tried to recall the tender moments they had shared when she was alive. She had operated a candy store until she got sick, after which she mostly slept or sat by the window, looking frail and weak. Sometimes she would yell out for her son to get her some medicine, and young Morrie, playing stickball in the street, would pretend he did not hear her. In his mind he believed he could make the illness go away by ignoring it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Uneducated and barely able to speak English, he was terribly poor, and the family was on public assistance much of the time. Their apartment was a dark, cramped, depressing place behind the candy store. They had no luxuries. No car. Sometimes, to make money, Morrie and his younger brother, David, would wash porch steps together for a nickel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没受过什么教育，不会说英语，所以一直很贫穷，家里大部分时间是靠救济度日的。他们的住房就在糖果店的后面，既黑又窄，令人十分压抑。他们没有一件奢侈品。没有汽车。为了挣钱，莫里和他弟弟大卫有时去替别人擦洗门廊的石阶，以换取一个五美分的硬币。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After their mother's death, the two boys were sent off to a small hotel in the Connecticut woods where several families shared a large cabin and a communal kitchen. The fresh air might be good for the children, the relatives thought. Morrie and David had never seen so much greenery, and they ran and played in the fields. One night after dinner, they went for a walk and it began to rain. Rather than come inside, they splashed around for hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的母亲死后，兄弟俩被送到了康涅狄克州森林里的一家小旅馆，那儿好几个家庭住在一块，共用一间大的卧室和厨房。亲戚们认为，那里的新鲜空气对孩子们会有好处的。莫里和大卫从未见过这么大的绿色世界，他们在野外尽情地玩耍。一天吃过晚饭，他们外出散步时天下起了雨。他们没有回家，而在雨里折腾了几个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So in the mornings, he went to synagogue -- by himself, because his father was not a religious man -- and he stood among the swaying men in their long black coats and he asked God to take care of his dead mother and his sick brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是每天早上，他都要去犹太教堂——独自一人去，因为他父亲不是个教徒——站在那些身 穿黑长袍。身子不停晃动的人中间，祈求上帝保佑他死去的母亲和患病的弟弟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, the rain did not cause this. But a child Morrie's age could not understand that. For a long time -- as his brother was taken back and forth to a special medical home and was forced to wear braces on his legs, which left him limping -- Morrie felt responsible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，淋雨并不是得病的原因。但莫里这个年龄的孩子是不会知道的。有很长一段时间——看着弟弟去一个专门的诊所治疗，两脚不得不戴上护套以致留下了跛脚的后遗症——莫里一直在自责。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他得了小儿麻痹症。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But a saving embrace came into Morrie's life the following year: his new stepmother, Eva. She was a short Romanian immigrant with plain features, curly brown hair, and the energy of two women. She had a glow that warmed the otherwise murky atmosphere his father created. She talked when her new husband was silent, she sang songs to the children at night. Morrie took comfort in her soothing voice, her school lessons, her strong character.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但就在第二年，莫里得到了感情的补偿：他的继母伊娃。她是个矮小的罗马尼亚移民， 长得很普通，一头棕色的鬈发，有着超人的精力。她身上像光一样的热情温暖了这个本来显得抑郁的家。当她新嫁的丈夫沉默不语时，她会滔滔不绝，晚上她给孩子们唱歌。她柔和的声音。传授的知识和坚强的性格抚平了莫里受伤的心灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When his brother returned from the medical home, still wearing leg braces from the polio, the two of them shared a rollaway bed in the kitchen of their apartment, and Eva would kiss them good-night. Morrie waited on those kisses like a puppy waits on milk, and he felt, deep down, that he had a mother again.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no escaping their poverty, however. They lived now in the Bronx, in a one -- bedroom apartment in a redbrick building on Tremont Avenue, next to an Italian beer garden where the old men played boccie on summer evenings. Because of the Depression, Morrie's father found even less work in the fur business. Sometimes when the family sat at the dinner table, all Eva could put out was bread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，他们仍没有逃离贫穷。他们现在住到了布朗克斯区，那是特里蒙德街上一幢红砖楼房里的一套单问，紧靠着一个意大利露天啤酒店，夏天的晚上那儿常有老人玩室外地滚球。由于经济的萧条，莫里的父亲在皮毛业更难找到工作。有时，当一家人坐在餐桌前时，伊娃拿来的仅仅是面包。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He studied at night, by the lamp at the kitchen table. And in the mornings he would go to synagogue to say Yizkor -- the memorial prayer for the dead -- for his mother. He did this to keep her memory alive. Incredibly, Morrie had been told by his father never to talk about her. Charlie wanted young David to think Eva was his natural mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，他在厨房餐桌上的那盏台灯下学习，早上，他去犹太教堂为母亲求主眷念——为死者作祷告。但令人费解的是，他父亲从不让他提起死去的母亲。查理希望幼小的大卫把伊娃当作亲生的母亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, despite their circumstances, Morrie was taught to love and to care. And to learn. Eva would accept nothing less than excellence in school, because she saw education as the only antidote to their poverty. She herself went to night school to improve her English. Morrie's love for education was hatched in her arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使处在这样的境遇，莫里还是学会了去爱，去关心，去学习。伊娃要求他在学校成绩优秀，她把受教育视作脱离贫困的唯一解药。她自己也在上夜校提高英语水平。莫里在她的怀抱里养成了对学习的热爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a terrible burden to Morrie. For years, the only evidence Morrie had of his mother was the telegram announcing her death. He had hidden it the day it arrived.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was dark and hot, the windows covered with filth, and the machines were packed tightly together, churning like train wheels. The fur hairs were flying, creating a thickened air, and the workers, sewing the pelts together, were bent over their needles as the boss marched up and down the rows, screaming for them to go faster. Morrie could barely breathe. He stood next to his father, frozen with fear, hoping the boss wouldn't scream at him, too.</div>
