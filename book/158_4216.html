<div class="line_en">Mr. and Mrs. Follenvie dined at the end of the table. The man, rattling like a crackled locomotive, had too much trouble in breathing to talk while eating, but his wife was never silent. She told all her impressions at the arrival of the Prussians, what they did, what they said, reviling them because they cost her some money, and because she had two sons in the army. She ad-dressed herself especially to the Countess, flattered by being able to talk with a lady of quality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伏郎卫先生两夫妇都坐在桌子的另一头吃东西，男的呢，喘得像是一个坏了的火车头，他肺部呼出吸进的气太多，以致无法在吃饭的时候谈天；不过他的女人却永远是叽叽呱呱的。她讲起自己在普鲁士人初到时得来的种种印象，他们做过的事，他们说过的话，她咒骂他们，首先因为他们害得她花了钱，其次，因为她有两个儿子从军去了。她尤其爱对伯爵夫人谈天，因为和一个有地位的夫人谈天在她是受到了宠遇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, Madame, those people there not only eat our potatoes and pork, but our pork and potatoes. And it must not be believed that they are at all proper-oh, no! such filthy things they do, saving the respect I owe to you! And if you could see them exercise for hours in the day! they are all there in the field, marching ahead, then marching back, turning here and turning there. They might be cultivating the land, or at least working on the roads of their own country! But no, Madame, these military men are profitable to no one. Poor people have to feed them, or perhaps be murdered! I am only an old woman without education, it is true, but when I see some endangering their constitutions by raging from morning to night, I say:"When there are so many people found to be useless, how unnecessary it is for others to take so much trouble to be nuisances! Truly, is it not an abomination to kill people, whether they be Prussian, or English, or Polish, or French? If one man revenges himself upon another who has done him some in-jury, it is wicked and he is punished; but when they ex-terminate our boys, as if they were game, with guns, they give decorations, indeed, to the one who destroys the most! Now, you see, I can never understand that, never!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对啊，夫人，那些人做的事不过是吃马铃薯和猪肉，以后又是猪肉和马铃薯。而且千万别相信他们都是清洁的——哈，简直不成！——说句不客气的话，他们四处随意拉撒。设若您看见他们连着整天整天的操演哟；他们操演起来都在那边的一片地里：向前进，向后退，向这边转，向那边转——设若他们在他们国内至少种地，或者修路！那还罢了——但是并没有，夫人，这些军人对谁都没有益处。是不是应当由可怜的百姓养活他们使他们只去学着屠杀！——我自己不过是一个没有受过教育的老妇人，这是真的，不过我看见他们费尽气力去从早到晚在地面上踏过去又踏过来，就暗自说道：‘在世上正有好些人为了有益于人求得那么多的发明，另外好些人却费着这么多的气力来使自己可以害人！真的，难道杀人不是一件令人憎恶的事？无论是普鲁士人，是英国人，是波兰人或者是法国人。’——倘若有人在一个害过他的人身上寻报复，那是错的，因为法律惩罚寻报复的人；不过到了有人把我们的孩子当作野味一般开枪去围剿的时候，既然有人把勋章赏给那些最会摧毁我们孩子的人，所以那是对的，这又怎么说呢？——不成，您看这是怎么回事，我简直弄不懂！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Carré-Lamadon reflected profoundly. Al-though he was prejudiced as a Captain of Industry, the good sense of this peasant woman made him think of the opulence that would be brought into the country were the idle and consequently mischievous hands, and the troops which were now maintained in unproductiveness, employed in some great industrial work that it would require centuries to achieve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迦来－辣马东先生深沉地思索起来。他虽然非常迷信出名的将官，不过这个乡下老妇人的常识却引起了他的思考：这么多的人手空着不做事自然就是坐吃山空的，若是用着这些人手在一个国家做事可以造成何等的繁荣，这么多的被人废置不用的劳动力，若是用在大规模的工业上真得要好几百华才用得完。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Loiseau, leaving his place, went to speak with the innkeeper in a low tone of voice. The great man laughed, shook, and squeaked, his corpulence quivered with joy at the jokes of his neighbor, and he bought of him six cases of wine for spring, after the Prussians had gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of about an hour, he heard a groping, and, looking quickly, he perceived Ball-of-Fat, who appeared still more plump in a blue cashmere negligee trimmed with white lace. She had a candle in her hand and was directing her steps toward the great door at the end of the corridor. But a door at the side opened, and when she returned at the end of some minutes Cornudet, in his suspenders, followed her. They spoke low. then they stopped. Ball-of-Fat seemed to be de-fending the entrance to her room with energy. Loiseau, unfortunately, could not hear all their words, but final-ly, as they raised their voices, he was able to catch a few. Cornudet insisted with vivacity. He said:"Come, now, you are a silly woman; what harm can be done?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then all the house was still. And immediately there arose somewhere, from an uncertain quarter, which might be the cellar but was quite as likely to be the garret, a powerful snoring, monotonous and regular, a heavy, prolonged sound, like a great kettle under pressure. Mr. Follenvie was asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，整个一所房子全是没有声息的了。不过一会儿之后，在一个难于确定的方位，可能是在地下室也许是在搁楼，又起了一阵有力的和单调而有规律的抽鼾声音，一种迟钝而且拖长的噪音还带有锅炉受着蒸汽压力样的震动。伏郎卫先生睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they had decided that they would set out at eight o'clock the next morning, they all collected in the kitchen. But the carriage, the roof of which was covered with snow, stood undisturbed in the courtyard, without horses and without a conductor. They sought him in vain in the stables, in the hay, and in the coach-house. Then they resolved to scour the town, and start-ed out. They found themselves in a square, with a church at one end, and some low houses on either side, where they perceived some Prussian soldiers. The first one they saw was paring potatoes. The second, further off, was cleaning the hairdresser's shop. Another, bearded to the eyes, was tending a troublesome brat, cradling it and trying to appease it; and the great peasant women, whose husbands were"away in the army,"indicated by signs to their obedient conquerors the work they wished to have done: cutting wood, cooking the soup, grinding the coffee, or what not. One of them even washed the linen of his hostess, an impotent old grandmother.</div>

They are from far off, I know not where; and they have left wives and children in their country; it is not amusing to them, this war, I can tell you! I am sure they also weep for their homes, and that it makes as much sorrow among them as it does among us. Here, now, there is not so much unhappiness for the moment, because the soldiers do no harm and they work as if they were in their own homes.
