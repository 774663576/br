<div class="line_en">For all the lags and mismatches between the historical trajectories of the United States and Europe, they did undergo one trend in synchrony: their rates of violence did a U-turn in the 1960s. Figures 3-1 through 3-4 show that European countries underwent a bounce in homicide rates that brought them back to levels they had said goodbye to a century before. And figure 3-10 shows that in the 1960s the homicide rate in America went through the roof. After a three-decade free fall that spanned the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, Americans multiplied their homicide rate by more than two and a half, from a low of 4.0 in 1957 to a high of 10.2 in 1980. The upsurge included every other category of major crime as well, including rape, assault, robbery, and theft, and lasted (with ups and downs) for three decades. The cities got particularly dangerous, especially New York, which became a symbol of the new criminality. Though the surge in violence affected all the races and both genders, it was most dramatic among black men, whose annual homicide rate had shot up by the mid-1980s to 72 per 100,000.</div>

<div class="line_en">The flood of violence from the 1960s through the 1980s reshaped American culture, the political scene, and everyday life. Mugger jokes became a staple of comedians, with mentions of Central Park getting an instant laugh as a well-known death trap. New Yorkers imprisoned themselves in their apartments with batteries of latches and deadbolts, including the popular "police lock," a steel bar with one end anchored in the floor and the other propped up against the door. The section of downtown Boston not far from where I now live was called the Combat Zone because of its endemic muggings and stabbings. Urbanites quit other American cities in droves, leaving burned-out cores surrounded by rings of suburbs, exurbs, and gated communities. Books, movies, and television series used intractable urban violence as their backdrop, including Little Murders, Taxi Driver, The Warriors, Escape from New York, Fort Apache the Bronx, Hill Street Blues, and Bonfire of the Vanities. Women enrolled in self-defense courses to learn how to walk with a defiant gait, to use their keys, pencils, and spike heels as weapons, and to execute karate chops or jujitsu throws to overpower an attacker, role-played by a volunteer in a Michelinman-tire suit. Red-bereted Guardian Angels patrolled the parks and the transit system, and in 1984 Bernhard Goetz, a mild-mannered engineer, became a folk hero for shooting four young muggers in a New York subway car. A fear of crime helped elect decades of conservative politicians, including Richard Nixon in 1968 with his "Law and Order" platform (overshadowing the Vietnam War as a campaign issue), George H. W. Bush in 1988 with his insinuation that Michael Dukakis, as governor of Massachusetts, had approved a prison furlough program that had released a rapist, and many senators and congressmen who promised to "get tough on crime." Though the popular reaction was overblown -- far more people are killed every year in car accidents than in homicides, especially among those who don't get into arguments with young men in bars -- the sense that violent crime had multiplied was not a figment of their imaginations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="20世纪60年代至80年代，暴力的大洪水重新塑造了美国的文化、政治舞台和人们的日常生活。关于抢劫的笑话成为喜剧节目的当家菜，“中央公园”就是“死亡陷阱”的代名词。纽约人将自己囚禁在公寓里，里面有电池闩锁和辅助锁，还有流行一时的“警察锁”——一根钢管，一端固定在地板上，另一端顶住门。我现在的家距离波士顿市中心不远，当年，那里被称为“作战区”，因为抢劫和捅人的事件层出不穷。城里人纷纷驾车逃离，搬往近郊、远郊或者有围墙警卫的封闭社区，被他们抛在身后的下城如一片烧毁的废墟。书籍、电影、电视剧将恐怖的城市暴力作为创作背景，比如《小型谋杀案》（Little Murders）、《出租车司机》（Taxi Driver）、《战士帮》（The Warriors）、《纽约大逃亡》（Escape from New York）、《布朗克斯－阿帕奇要塞》（Fort Apache the Bronx）、《希尔街的布鲁斯》（Hill Street Blues）和《虚荣的篝火》（Bonfire of the Vanities）。妇女们纷纷上课学习防身术。身穿层层防护衣，如同米其林轮胎先生一般的志愿者裹上气垫圈扮演暴徒，让妇女练习如何目不斜视地走路，如何将钥匙、铅笔和高跟鞋的鞋跟变作自卫的武器，如何使用空手道的劈和柔道的摔制胜敌人。头戴红色贝雷帽的“守护天使”在公园和车站巡逻。1984年，伯恩哈德·格茨，一位举止温和的工程师，在纽约地铁车厢里开枪击中四名年轻的劫匪，顿时成为民间英雄。对犯罪的恐惧，在几十年间让保守派政客不断当选，尼克松1968年提出“法律与秩序”的施政纲领，在竞选关注上竟然压倒了越战；老布什1988年在电视辩论中对杜卡基斯冷嘲热讽，皆因杜卡基斯这位麻省州长批准了一项监狱休假计划，让一名强奸犯得以获释；众多参议员和众议员都承诺对犯罪“绝不姑息手软”。虽然公众的反应是有些过度，事实上，每年的车祸死亡人数远远高于凶杀死亡，尤其那些不在酒吧与年轻人吵架的人群中，更是如此。但是，暴力犯罪倍增，这样的感觉也绝非人们的凭空臆想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An obvious place to look is demographics. The 1940s and 1950s, when crime rates hugged the floor, were the great age of marriage. Americans got married in numbers not seen before or since, which removed men from the streets and planted them in suburbs. One consequence was a bust in violence. But the other was a boom in babies. The first baby boomers, born in 1946, entered their crime-prone years in 1961; the ones born in the peak year, 1954, entered in 1969. A natural conclusion is that the crime boom was an echo of the baby boom. Unfortunately, the numbers don't add up. If it were just a matter of there being more teenagers and twenty-somethings who were committing crimes at their usual rates, the increase in crime from 1960 to 1970 would have been 13 percent, not 135 percent. Young men weren't simply more numerous than their predecessors; they were more violent too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最明显的莫过于人口结构的变化。20世纪40年代和50年代是婚姻盛行的年代，犯罪率跌到谷底。美国涌入婚姻的人数之高，迄今为止无出其右。婚姻将男人们从街头领回郊外的家中。婚姻高峰的结果一是严重打击了犯罪，二是带来了婴儿潮。1946年出生的第一批婴儿，1961年进入犯罪高风险的年龄。在婴儿潮高峰1954年出生的婴儿，在1969年进入这一年龄。结论似乎很自然，犯罪热浪是对婴儿潮的响应。不过，这两组数字讲不通。如果仅仅是因为有了更多十几二十几岁的青年人，其中一部分人犯了这个年纪易犯的罪行，那么从1960年到1970年犯罪增长应该是13%，而不是135%。而且，这些青年人不仅在犯罪人数上，在暴力的程度也超过了他们的前辈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why did the Western world embark on a three-decade binge of crime from which it has never fully recovered? This is one of several local reversals of the long-term decline of violence that I will examine in this book. If the analysis is on the right track, then the historical changes I have been invoking to explain the decline should have gone into reverse at the time of the surges.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rebounding of violence in the 1960s defied every expectation. The decade was a time of unprecedented economic growth, nearly full employment, levels of economic equality for which people today are nostalgic, historic racial progress, and the blossoming of government social programs, not to mention medical advances that made victims more likely to survive being shot or knifed. Social theorists in 1962 would have happily bet that these fortunate conditions would lead to a continuing era of low crime. And they would have lost their shirts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="20世纪60年代的暴力回潮出乎所有人的意料。当时经济高速增长，接近充分就业，收入差距之小，简直就是今日人们的梦想；历史性的种族平等正在起步，政府的各种公共项目遍地开花，而医学的进步，让挨了刀枪的受害者有更大的机会获救。社会理论家们在1962年很可能兴高采烈地打赌说，因为这些有利的条件，我们将迎来一个低犯罪率的时代。但他们赌输了，还输得精光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is a perennial invasion of barbarians who must somehow be civilized and turned into contributors to fulfillment of the various functions requisite to societal survival." That "invasion" is the coming of age of a new generation of young people. Every society copes with this enormous socialization process more or less successfully, but occasionally that process is literally swamped by a quantitative discontinuity in the number of persons involved… In 1950 and still in 1960 the "invading army" (those aged fourteen to twenty-four) were outnumbered three to one by the size of the "defending army" (those aged twenty-five to sixty-four). By 1970 the ranks of the former had grown so fast that they were only outnumbered two to one by the latter, a state of affairs that had not existed since 1910.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many criminologists have concluded that the 1960s crime surge cannot be explained by the usual socioeconomic variables but was caused in large part by a change in cultural norms. Of course, to escape the logical circle in which people are said to be violent because they live in a violent culture, it's necessary to identify an exogenous cause for the cultural change. The political scientist James Q. Wilson has argued that demographics were an important trigger after all, not because of the absolute numbers of young people but because of their relative numbers. He makes the point by commenting on a quotation from the demographer Norman Ryder:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多犯罪学家都认为，20世纪60年代的犯罪高潮不能用通常的社会经济变量来解释，其缘由主要在于文化准则的变化。当然，为了摆脱所谓暴力者是因为他们生活在暴力文化中这种循环逻辑，我们必须辨识文化变迁的外生原因。政治学家詹姆斯·Q·威尔逊（James Q. Wilson）坚持说，无论如何，人口结构是一个关键的触发因素，不是因为年轻人的绝对人数，而是因为他们的相对份额。他借评论人口学家诺曼·赖德（Norman Ryder）的一段话表明了自己的观点：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Subsequent analyses showed that this explanation is not, by itself, satisfactory. Age cohorts that are larger than their predecessors do not, in general, commit more crimes. But I think Wilson was on to something when he linked the 1960s crime boom to a kind of intergenerational decivilizing process. In many ways the new generation tried to push back against the eightcentury movement described by Norbert Elias.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后续的分析将表明，这种解释，如果是作为单一的因素，是不能令人满意的。一般地说，某一年龄组人数大于它的前辈，并不意味着更多的犯罪。但威尔逊将60年代的犯罪浪潮和代际文明退化过程联系了起来，确实抓住了某种东西。从许多方面看，新一代人是在反抗一场已经持续了8个世纪的文明运动（埃利亚斯语）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The baby boomers were unusual (I know, we baby boomers are always saying we're unusual) in sharing an emboldening sense of solidarity, as if their generation were an ethnic group or a nation. (A decade later it was pretentiously referred to as "Woodstock Nation.") Not only did they outnumber the older generation, but thanks to new electronic media, they felt the strength of their numbers. The baby boomers were the first generation to grow up with television. And television, especially in the three-network era, allowed them to know that other baby boomers were sharing their experiences, and to know that the others knew that they knew. This common knowledge, as economists and logicians call it, gave rise to a horizontal web of solidarity that cut across the vertical ties to parents and authorities that had formerly isolated young people from one another and forced them to kowtow to their elders. Much like a disaffected population that feels its strength only when it assembles at a rally, baby boomers saw other young people like themselves in the audience of The Ed Sullivan Show grooving on the Rolling Stones and knew that every other young person in America was grooving at the same time, and knew that the others knew that they knew.</div>

<div class="line_en">The baby boomers were bonded by another new technology of solidarity, first marketed by an obscure Japanese company called Sony: the transistor radio. The parents of today who complain about the iPods and cell phones that are soldered onto the ears of teenagers forget that their own parents made the same complaint about them and their transistor radios. I can still remember the thrill of tuning in to signals from New York radio stations bouncing off the late-night ionosphere into my bedroom in Montreal, listening to Motown and Dylan and the British invasion and psychedelia and feeling that something was happening here, but Mr. Jones didn't know what it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">A sense of solidarity among fifteen-to-thirty-year-olds would be a menace to civilized society even in the best of times. But this decivilizing process was magnified by a trend that had been gathering momentum throughout the 20th century. The sociologist Cas Wouters, a translator and intellectual heir of Elias, has argued that after the European Civilizing Process had run its course, it was superseded by an informalizing process. The Civilizing Process had been a flow of norms and manners from the upper classes downward. But as Western countries became more democratic, the upper classes became increasingly discredited as moral paragons, and hierarchies of taste and manners were leveled. The informalization affected the way people dressed, as they abandoned hats, gloves, ties, and dresses for casual sportswear. It affected the language, as people started to address their friends with first names instead of Mr. and Mrs. and Miss. And it could be seen in countless other ways in which speech and demeanor became less mannered and more spontaneous. The stuffy high-society lady, like the Margaret Dumont character in the Marx Brothers movies, became a target of ridicule rather than emulation.</div>

<div class="line_en">After having been steadily beaten down by the informalizing process, the elites then suffered a second hit to their legitimacy. The civil rights movement had exposed a moral blot on the American establishment, and as critics shone a light on other parts of society, more stains came into view. Among them were the threat of a nuclear holocaust, the pervasiveness of poverty, the mistreatment of Native Americans, the many illiberal military interventions, particularly the Vietnam War, and later the despoliation of the environment and the oppression of women and homosexuals. The stated enemy of the Western establishment, Marxism, gained prestige as it made inroads in third-world "liberation" movements, and it was increasingly embraced by bohemians and fashionable intellectuals. Surveys of popular opinion from the 1960s through the 1990s showed a plummeting of trust in every social institution.</div>

<div class="line_en">The leveling of hierarchies and the harsh scrutiny of the power structure were unstoppable and in many ways desirable. But one of the side effects was to undermine the prestige of aristocratic and bourgeois lifestyles that had, over the course of several centuries, become less violent than those of the working class and underclass.

<div class="line_en">These currents pushed against the civilizing tide in ways that were celebrated in the era's popular culture. The backsliding, to be sure, did not originate in the two prime movers of Elias's Civilizing Process. Government control did not retreat into anarchy, as it had in the American West and in newly independent third-world countries, nor did an economy based on commerce and specialization give way to feudalism and barter. But the next step in Elias's sequence -- the psychological change toward greater self-control and interdependence -- came under steady assault in the counterculture of the generation that came of age in the 1960s.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些逆文明浪潮而动的湍流，受到大众文化的欢迎和喝彩。显然，埃利亚斯文明进程的两个原动力不是这种倒退的原因。政府管制既没有蜕化到美国西部和第三世界新独立国家那样的无政府状态，以商业和专业分工为基础的经济也没有退回到封建制度和实物交易。然而，埃利亚斯文明序列中的第二步——与更大的自制和相互依赖相应的心理变化，却在20世纪60年代反主流的年轻人中受到重挫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A prime target was the inner governor of civilized behavior, self-control. Spontaneity, self-expression, and a defiance of inhibitions became cardinal virtues. "If it feels good, do it," commanded a popular lapel button. Do It was the title of a book by the political agitator Jerry Rubin. "Do It 'Til You're Satisfied (Whatever It Is)" was the refrain of a popular song by BT Express. The body was elevated over the mind: Keith Richards boasted, "Rock and roll is music from the neck downwards." And adolescence was elevated over adulthood: "Don't trust anyone over thirty," advised the agitator Abbie Hoffman; "Hope I die before I get old," sang The Who in "My Generation." Sanity was denigrated, and psychosis romanticized, in movies such as A Fine Madness, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, King of Hearts, and Outrageous. And then of course there were the drugs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another target of the counterculture was the ideal that individuals should be embedded in webs of dependency that obligate them to other people in stable economies and organizations. If you wanted an image that contradicted this ideal as starkly as possible, it might be a rolling stone. Originally from a song by Muddy Waters, the image resonated with the times so well that it lent itself to three icons of the culture: the rock group, the magazine, and the famous song by Bob Dylan (in which he taunts an upper-class woman who has become homeless). "Tune in, turn on, drop out," the motto of onetime Harvard psychology instructor Timothy Leary, became a watchword of the psychedelia movement. The idea of coordinating one's interests with others in a job was treated as selling out. As Dylan put it:</div>

<div class="line_en">Elias had written that the demands of self-control and the embedding of the self into webs of interdependence were historically reflected in the development of timekeeping devices and a consciousness of time: "This is why tendencies in the individual so often rebel against social time as represented by his or her super-ego, and why so many people come into conflict with themselves when they wish to be punctual." In the opening scene of the 1969 movie Easy Rider, Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda conspicuously toss their wristwatches into the dirt before setting off on their motorcycles to find America. That same year, the first album by the band Chicago (when they were known as the Chicago Transit Authority) contained the lyrics "Does anybody really know what time it is? Does anybody really care? If so I can't imagine why." All this made sense to me when I was sixteen, and so I discarded my own Timex. When my grandmother saw my naked wrist, she was incredulous: "How can you be a mensch without a zager?" She ran to a drawer and pulled out a Seiko she had bought during a visit to the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka. I have it to this day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Together with self-control and societal connectedness, a third ideal came under attack: marriage and family life, which had done so much to domesticate male violence in the preceding decades. The idea that a man and a woman should devote their energies to a monogamous relationship in which they raise their children in a safe environment became a target of howling ridicule.

The hippies were popularly perceived as unwashed and malodorous, which in my experience was a calumny. But there's no disputing that they rejected conventional standards of grooming, and an enduring image from Woodstock was of naked concertgoers frolicking in the mud. One could trace the reversal of conventions of propriety on album covers alone (figure 3-17). There was The Who Sell Out, with a sauce-dribbling Roger Daltrey immersed in a bath of baked beans; the Beatles' Yesterday and Today, with the lovable moptops adorned with chunks of raw meat and decapitated dolls (quickly recalled); the Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet, with a photo of a filthy public toilet (originally censored); and Who's Next, in which the four musicians are shown zipping up their flies while walking away from a urinespattered wall.

<div class="line_en">Throwing away your wristwatch or bathing in baked beans is, of course, a far cry from committing actual violence. The 1960s were supposed to be the era of peace and love, and so they were in some respects. But the glorification of dissoluteness shaded into an indulgence of violence and then into violence itself. At the end of every concert, The Who famously smashed their instruments to smithereens, which could be dismissed as harmless theater were it not for the fact that drummer Keith Moon also destroyed dozens of hotel rooms, partly deafened Pete Townshend by detonating his drums onstage, beat up his wife, girlfriend, and daughter, threatened to injure the hands of a keyboardist of the Faces for dating his ex-wife, and accidentally killed his bodyguard by running over him with his car before dying himself in 1978 of the customary drug overdose.</div>

<div class="line_en">Personal violence was sometimes celebrated in song, as if it were just another form of antiestablishment protest. In 1964 Martha Reeves and the Vandellas sang "Summer's here and the time is right for dancing in the street." Four years later the Rolling Stones replied that the time was right for fighting in the street. As part of their "satanic majesty" and "sympathy for the devil," the Stones had a theatrical ten-minute song, "Midnight Rambler," which acted out a rape-murder by the Boston Strangler, ending with the lines "I'm gonna smash down on your plate-glass window / Put a fist, put a fist through your steel-plated door / I'll… stick… my… knife… right… down… your… throat!" The affectation of rock musicians to treat every thug and serial killer as a dashing "rebel" or "outlaw" was satirized in This Is Spinal Tap when the band speaks of their plans to write a rock musical based on the life of Jack the Ripper.

<div class="line_en">When rock music burst onto the scene in the 1950s, politicians and clergymen vilified it for corrupting morals and encouraging lawlessness. (An amusing video reel of fulminating fogies can be seen in Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.) Do we now have to -- gulp -- admit they were right? Can we connect the values of 1960s popular culture to the actual rise in violent crimes that accompanied them? Not directly, of course. Correlation is not causation, and a third factor, the pushback against the values of the Civilizing Process, presumably caused both the changes in popular culture and the increase in violent behavior. Also, the overwhelming majority of baby boomers committed no violence whatsoever. Still, attitudes and popular culture surely reinforce each other, and at the margins, where susceptible individuals and subcultures can be buffeted one way or another, there are plausible causal arrows from the decivilizing mindset to the facilitation of actual violence.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of them was a self-handicapping of the criminal justice Leviathan. Though rock musicians seldom influence public policy directly, writers and intellectuals do, and they got caught up in the zeitgeist and began to rationalize the new licentiousness. Marxism made violent class conflict seem like a route to a better world. Influential thinkers like Herbert Marcuse and Paul Goodman tried to merge Marxism or anarchism with a new interpretation of Freud that connected sexual and emotional repression to political repression and championed a release from inhibitions as part of the revolutionary struggle. Troublemakers were increasingly seen as rebels and nonconformists, or as victims of racism, poverty, and bad parenting. Graffiti vandals were now "artists," thieves were "class warriors," and neighborhood hooligans were "community leaders." Many smart people, intoxicated by radical chic, did incredibly stupid things. Graduates of elite universities built bombs to be set off at army social functions, or drove getaway cars while "radicals" shot guards during armed robberies.

<div class="line_en">Even more calamitous than the return of hoodlums to the street was the mutual disengagement between law enforcement and communities, and the resulting deterioration of neighborhood life. Offenses against civil order like vagrancy, loitering, and panhandling were decriminalized, and minor crimes like vandalism, graffiti-spraying, turnstile-jumping, and urinating in public fell off the police radar screens. Thanks to intermittently effective antipsychotic drugs and a change in attitudes toward deviance, the wards of mental hospitals were emptied, which multiplied the ranks of the homeless.

<div class="line_en">The 1960s decivilizing process affected the choices of individuals as well as policymakers. Many young men decided that they ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more and, instead of pursuing a respectable family life, hung out in all-male packs that spawned the familiar cycle of competition for dominance, insult or minor aggression, and violent retaliation. The sexual revolution, which provided men with plentiful sexual opportunities without the responsibilities of marriage, added to this dubious freedom. Some men tried to get a piece of the lucrative trade in contraband drugs, in which self-help justice is the only way to enforce property rights. (The cutthroat market in crack cocaine in the late 1980s had a particularly low barrier for entry because doses of the drug could be sold in small amounts, and the resulting infusion of teenage crack dealers probably contributed to the 25 percent increase in the homicide rate between 1985 and 1991.)

<div class="line_cn" title="美国非裔社区受到文明退化的严重打击。由于历史原因，他们从二等公民的劣势地位起步。当新一波反正统的潮流袭来，并向错误的方向推进的前夕，许多年轻的美国黑人正在受尊敬的和下等人的两种生活方式之间徘徊。由于警察队伍中种族歧视的老情绪，加上司法系统姑息犯罪的新态度，与美国白人相比，黑人青年能够从执法部门得到的保护越来越少，而犯罪活动的受害者绝大部分是黑人。对执法部门的不信任，发展成玩世不恭，有时甚至是病态的偏执，这就让自助正义成为唯一的选择。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On top of these strikes came a feature of African American family life first pointed out by the sociologist Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his famous 1965 report, The Negro Family: The Case for National Action, for which he was initially vilified but eventually vindicated. A large proportion (today a majority) of black children are born out of wedlock, and many grow up without fathers. This trend, already visible in the early 1960s, may have been multiplied by the sexual revolution and yet again by perverse welfare incentives that encouraged young women to "marry the state" instead of the fathers of their children. Though I am skeptical of theories of parental influence that say that fatherless boys grow up violent because they lack a role model or paternal discipline (Moynihan himself, for example, grew up without a father), widespread fatherlessness can lead to violence for a different reason. All those young men who aren't bringing up their children are hanging out with one another competing for dominance instead. The mixture was as combustible in the inner city as it had been in the cowboy saloons and mining camps of the Wild West, this time not because there were no women around but because the women lacked the bargaining power to force the men into a civilized lifestyle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在所有这些打击之外，受到重创的还有美国非裔的家庭生活。最早是社会学家丹尼尔·帕特里克·莫伊尼汉（Daniel Patrick Moynihan），在1965年著名的报告《黑人家庭：要求国家采取行动》中提出了他的观察。一开始，他受到严厉的诋毁，但最终人们承认他是正确的。很大一部分（今天已经是绝大部分）黑人儿童是非婚生子女，很多人是在没有父亲的情况下长大的。这一趋势在60年代初期就已经显现，而后，性解放为这一趋势推波助澜，而扭曲的福利激励，更是鼓励年轻妇女“与国家结婚”，而不是与孩子的父亲结婚。父母影响论认为，没有父亲的男孩长大后有暴力倾向，因为家庭中缺少父亲的榜样和父亲的管教。虽然我对父母影响论持怀疑态度（比如，莫伊尼汉本人就是在没有父亲的家庭中长大的），但大量的无父家庭确实还有其他原因能够导致暴力。这些不养育自己子女的年轻男性，彼此厮混在一起，经常为争夺统治权而厮杀。下城充满火药味，战斗一触即发，气氛恰如当年野性西部的牛仔酒吧和矿工宿营地。不过，这一次不是因为周围没有女性，而是因为女性缺乏谈判能力，无法迫使男性接受文明的生活方式。">查看中文翻译</div>
