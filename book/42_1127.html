<div class="line_en">Zero spoke slowly, as if searching his brain for memories and clues. "And then later I know we lived on the street, but I don't know why we left the house. I'm pretty sure it was a house, and not an apartment. I know my room was yellow."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was late afternoon. They were resting in the shadow of the Thumb. They had spent the morning picking onions and putting them in the sack. It didn't take long, but long enough so that they had to wait another day before heading down the mountain.</div>

Zero held the shovel, and Stanley carried the sack, which was crammed with onions and the three jars of water. They left the pieces of the broken jar on the mountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一早他们下山了。他们把帽子在水里浸了浸，再戴在头上。零蛋拿着铲子，斯坦利背着袋子，袋里装满了洋葱，还有三罐水。那只破罐子被留在了山上。">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew I didn't belong at the party, even though it wasn't their playscape. There was this one mother who kept staring at me like I was some kind of monster.

<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利什么也没听到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked slowly and quietly, aware that sounds travel in both directions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们不声不响地慢慢走着，感觉两边都有声音传过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They continued walking very quietly and Stanley began to make out the faint sounds of Camp Green Lake. They were still too far away to see the camp, but he could hear a blend of indistinct voices. As they got closer he occasionally could hear Mr. Sir's distinctive bark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们继续安静地朝前走着。斯坦利勉强能听到从翠湖营隐隐约约传来的动静。尽管离营区还远得看不到，但他已经听得到模糊混杂的声音了。他们越走越近，斯坦利偶尔还能听到长官先生那与众不同的咆哮声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley nodded. He checked to make sure there was nothing living in it, then climbed down into a hole. Zero climbed into the one next to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利点了点头。他往洞里仔细地打量了一番，以免里面还住着什么东西，然后爬进了洞。零蛋爬进了旁边的洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They approached a cluster of holes. "Let's wait here, until they go in," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们接近了一片洞。“我们就等在这里，等到他们回营再说。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun cut through the cloud, and Stanley felt its rays beating down on him. But soon more clouds filled the sky, shading Stanley and his hole.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's the one," he whispered, pointing out the hole where he had found the gold tube. It was still about fifty yards away, but Stanley was pretty sure it was the right hole. There was no need to risk going any closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是那个。”他指着找到金色管子的那个洞轻声说道。尽管还有大约五十码远，但斯坦利十分肯定。没必要冒险继续走近了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They climbed down into adjacent holes, and waited for the camp to fall asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们钻进了身旁的洞里，等着整个翠湖营进入梦乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As quietly as possible, he and Zero climbed up out of their holes and crept toward camp. Stanley held the sack in front of him, cradled in his arms, instead of over his shoulder, to keep the jars from clanking against each other. A wave of terror rushed over him when he saw the compound -- the tents, the Wreck Room, the Warden's cabin under the two oak trees. The fear made him dizzy. He took a breath, summoned his courage, and continued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和零蛋悄无声息地从各自的洞里爬出来，轻手轻脚地朝营区走去。斯坦利把袋子抱在胸前，而不是扛在肩头，以免罐子丁零当啷地相撞。一看到翠湖营——帐篷、破坏室、两棵橡树下管理员大人的小木屋，一股恐惧便向他袭来，使他有些晕眩。他吸了一口气，鼓起勇气，继续前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
