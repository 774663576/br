<div class="line_en">At the end of the day, night comes and the world is peaceful and calm. Our little boat moves silently into some quiet little corner on the river. There we put up our tent, and we cook and eat our simple supper. Then we fill our pipes and we sit and talk quietly. Sometimes we stop for a moment or two and we listen to the water as it plays gently against the boat. The silver moon shines down on us and our heads are full of beautiful thoughts. We sit in silence for a time. We do not want to speak. Then we laugh quietly, put away our pipes, say'Goodnight'and go to bed. The peaceful sound of the water against the boat sends us to sleep -- and we dream. We dream that the world is young again…</div>

<div class="line_en">We decided to start on the following Saturday. Harris and I would go down to Kingston in the morning and take the boat up to Chertsey, but George could not leave the City until the afternoon. (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten o'clock until four o'clock from Monday to Friday. On Saturday they wake him up and put him out onto the street at two o'clock. ) So George was going to meet us at Chertsey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们准备下星期六出发。早上哈里斯和我先到金斯顿，从那儿把船划到彻特西和乔治碰头。但乔治下午才能离开伦敦城。（因为乔治周一到周五要在银行从上午十点“睡”到下午四点，只有在周六下午两点他们才把他叫醒，撵到街上来。）所以，我们决定到彻特西和乔治碰头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is evening. You are very wet. There is a lot of water in the boat and everything in it is wet, too. You find a place on the river bank which is not as wet as other places. You get out of the boat, pull out the tent, and two of you try to put it up. Because it is wet, it is very heavy. And then it falls on top of you. You cannot get it off your head, and you get angry. All the time it is raining heavily. It is difficult to put up a tent in good weather. In wet weather it is almost impossible. The other man does not help you. He starts to play about. You get your side of the tent up and begin to tie the ropes to the ground. Just then he pulls the tent from his side, and he destroys all your hard work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你看，天色已晚，你全身已经湿透，船里到处是水，所有东西都打湿了。你在岸上找了一块稍微干一点的地方，两个人出了船，把帐篷拖上岸，忙着把它支起来。帐篷浸透了水，异常沉重，突然又倒在你身上，压着你，头也伸不出来。你呢，简直快气疯了，而雨还是瓢泼似地下。本来，天好的时候支帐篷就不容易，而到了雨天，根本没戏。另一个人也不帮你，反而自己找乐子。你这边的帐篷刚支起来，把绳子绑在地上的桩子上，他那边使劲一拉，一下子把你辛辛苦苦干的活全废了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Ah! The stupid fool!'you hear him say to himself. And then, suddenly, he gives a violent pull -- and your side comes out, too. Slowly, you start to go round to his side to tell him what you think of him. At the same time, he begins to come round the other way, to tell you what he feels. And you follow each other round and round, and you shout at each other -- until the tent falls down. And there you are! You stand and look at each other across the tent. At the same time, you both call out,'There you are! What did I tell you?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咳！你这个傻蛋！”你听着他咕哝着，接着，也猛地一拉，你这边绳子、桩子也出来了。你缓缓地朝他那边走去，要和他理论；与此同时，他也绕过来要和你评是非。于是，两个人隔着帐篷，你追我赶绕着圈，互相骂个不停。最后整个帐篷都倒了，你们两个站在那儿，隔着这堆帐篷，互相瞪着眼，又异口同声地叫道：“你看你！我是怎么对你说的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the third man has been trying to get the water out of the boat. The water has run up his arms, and he is wet and angry. Suddenly, he wants to know what you are doing, and why the tent is not up yet.</div>

<div class="line_en">'I tell you, you're wrong!'you scream, and you wish you could get to him to hit him. You pull your side of the tent hard -- and pull out all the ropes on his side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我跟你说，你那样不对！”你尖声吼起来，恨不能够走过去揍他一顿。你使劲拉你这边的帐篷，一下子把他那边的绳子、桩子都拔了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When, at last, the tent is up, you carry the things out of the boat. Supper is mostly rainwater -- rainwater bread, rainwater soup. Happily, you have something strong to drink. This brings back your interest in life until it is time to go to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，帐篷算是支起来了，你把东西从船里搬出来。晚餐主要是雨水——雨水面包，雨水汤。幸亏你还有点够味的东西喝，使你恢复对人生的兴趣，然后酣然入梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

At first, you think that the world has ended. Then you think that this cannot be true. So it must be thieves, or murderers, or fire. No help comes, and all you know is that thousands of people are kicking you, and you cannot breathe.</div>
