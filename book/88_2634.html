<div class="line_en">Jill felt her heart quicken at Rebecca's words, a feeling that things were happening too fast and that they weren't prepared. Her decision seemed sudden, even though Jill really hadn't doubted that she'd volunteer; Rebecca was a lot stronger than she looked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill caught her eye and smiled encouragingly. At Rebecca's age, Jill had been a professional thief, and a good one. She was worried about Rebecca, too, but only because she'd grown to care about her. The fact that she was a young woman wasn't a reason to underestimate her talents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔看着瑞贝卡，像是在鼓励她一般微微笑了笑。吉尔在瑞贝卡这个年纪的时候是一名十分专业、而且非常厉害的小偷。吉尔之所以会担心这位少女，大概是因为喜欢上她那种性格了吧。对方还只是一名年轻的女孩，所以即便看到她有什么特殊的能力，吉尔也绝对不会吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The respect between the two men was obvious, making Jill like David all the more. In spite of Barry's screw ups in the Spencer fiasco, Jill had grown to trust him, something she didn't do easily and he seemed confident in David Trapp's skills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两个人一直相互尊重着对方。感觉到这一点之后，吉尔更加欣赏眼前的大卫。她很少信任一个人，但即便巴瑞在斯宾塞别墅中犯下了那些错误，但她仍然相信这位魁梧的队友——另外，巴瑞似乎也非常信任大卫•特拉普的能力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill picked up on the same thread of bitterness she'd noticed earlier, on the word "betrayal." The fact that the S. T. A. R. S. were in bed with Umbrella obviously wasn't sitting too well with Mr. Trapp…</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill was disappointed and angry that the S. T. A. R. S. had sold out, but it wasn't going to be a factor in her decision to work at bringing Umbrella down. Her path had been determined on the day that the McGee sisters had been brutally murdered. The two little girls were the first innocent victims of the T-Virus spill at the Spencer estate and they had been her friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔确实对S.T．A.R．S被轻易笼络和控制感到相当不满和失望，但这并不是她决心打垮安布雷拉的根本原因。她在玛吉姐妹被残害的那一天就已经决定了自己今后要踏上的道路。幼小、无助的姐妹俩根本就没犯任何错，却成为了T病毒最初的牺牲者。那两姐妹可以说是她最好的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pushed the thoughts away, focusing on the matter at hand. Without the S. T. A. R. S., their job was going to be a lot tougher. Not impossible, but she had to admit to herself that their chance of success had just dropped to somewhere near zero. It was a good thing she didn't mind being the underdog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔重新将注意力集中到眼前的事件上来，将玛吉姐妹的身影抛出自己的大脑。如果没有加入S.T．A.R．S，工作对她来说一定会变成一件非常艰难的事。虽说不是绝对不可能，但如果事情真变成那样的话，吉尔也不得不承认达成自己目的的可能性几乎无限接近于零。可即便如此，哪怕明知会失败，她还是要参加战斗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We couldn't count on that," Jill said. "If they got to the S. T. A. R. S., they could get to anyone. And without evidence… well, you gotta admit, the story's the kind of thing even the tabloids wouldn't buy."</div>

<div class="line_en">David nodded agreement. "Yes, I think that should be a priority. My concern is how to get in touch with them. The branch offices may already be tapped, and we want to keep Umbrella from learning about our plans for as long as possible. Unfortunately, we won't have use of the S. T. A. R. S.'s resources for much longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫点点头表示同意：“没错，你们先去办这件事。不过到底要如何与他们接触是一个难题。支部的电话肯定已经被窃听了，尽量让安布雷拉晚一些知道我们的计划。而且遗憾的是，S.T．A.R．S的资料我们可能用不了太久了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe we should look for a go-between," Jill said slowly. "Someone who doesn't have ties to the S. T. A. R. S"</div>

<div class="line_en">It sounded good, but Jill found herself feeling frustrated by the talk. She wanted to act. Waiting for the S. T. A. R. S. to contact them had been bad enough; knowing that Rebecca was going to be risking her life while they waited idly by would be excruciating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管这像是一个好主意，但吉尔对这种商量的方式本身感到有不满。她想参加行动，与S.T．A.R．S候补队员接触，之后再找个地方躲起来等待另一边调查的结果，这根本是在浪费时间。也就是说瑞贝卡正冒着生命危险进行调查时，自己却要在安全的地方待命。这简直比严刑拷打还要让吉尔难以忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Brilliant," David said. "Perhaps you could ask him to help you look into the local police as well. Once we have solid evidence from the Maine facility, we can go to your friend, instigate a federal investigation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了。”大卫说，“应该能请求那个人调查一下本地的警察。如果我们能在缅因州的研究所拿到关键证据，就可以把它交给你的朋友，让他展开联邦等级的全面调查。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chris grinned suddenly. "I know a guy from back in the Air Force who works for Jack Hamilton now, one of the section heads for the FBI -- I don't know much about Hamilton, but Pete's about as honest as they come. And he owes me a favor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯突然笑了起来：“我在空军服役时认识的一位好友目前在FBI部长杰克•汉密尔顿那里工作。虽然我不太了解汉密尔顿的为人，但彼德提到过他是一个正直的长官。更何况他还欠我一个人情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I had been formulating a plan to infiltrate Umbrella headquarters, a risky proposition at best.

<div class="line_en">Jill was already moving around the couch, disappearing silently into the thick shadows, Barry and Rebecca right behind.
