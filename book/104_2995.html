<div class="line_en">I had always thought that wringing one's hands was a fictional gesture -- the obscure outcome, perhaps, of some medieval ritual; but as I took to the woods, for a spell of despair and desperate meditation, this was the gesture ("look, Lord, at these chains!") that would have come nearest to the mute expression of my mood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="匆果夏洛持是瓦莱里亚，我就知道该如何应付这局面；“应付”正是我要的词。以往，我只需扭住瓦莱契卡胖胖的脆弱的手腕（骑自行车摔伤的那只），就能立刻叫她改变主意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Had Charlotte been Valeria, I would have known how to handle the situation; and "handle" is the word I want. In the good old days, by merely twisting fat Valechka's brittle wrist (the one she had fallen upon from a bicycle) I could make her change her mind instantly; but anything of the sort in regard to Charlotte was unthinkable. Bland American Charlotte frightened me. My lighthearted dream of controlling her through her passion for me was all wrong. I dared not do anything to spoil the image of me she had set up to adore. I had toadied to her when she was the awesome duenna of my darling, and a groveling something still persisted in my attitude toward her. The only ace I held was her ignorance of my monstrous love for her Lo. She had been annoyed by Lo's liking me; but my feelings she could not divine. To Valeria I might have said: "Look here, you fat fool, c'est moi qui décide what is good for Dolores Humbert." To Charlotte, I could not even say (with ingratiating calm): "Excuse me, my dear, I disagree. Let us give the child one more chance. Let me be her private tutor for a year or so. You once told me yourself --" In fact, I could not say anything at all to Charlotte about the child without giving myself away. Oh, you cannot imagine (as I had never imagined) what these women of principle are! Charlotte, who did not notice the falsity of all the everyday conventions and rules of behavior, and foods, and books, and people she doted upon, would distinguish at once a false intonation in anything I might say with a view to keeping Lo near. She was like a musician who may be an odious vulgarian in ordinary life, devoid of tact and taste; but who will hear a false note in music with diabolical accuracy of judgment. To break Charlotte's will, I would have to break her heart. If I broke her heart, her image of me would break too. If I said: "Either I have my way with Lolita, and you help me to keep the matter quiet, or we part at once," she would have turned as pale as a woman of clouded glass and slowly replied: "All right, whatever you add or retract, this is the end." And the end it would be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such, then, was the mess. I remember reaching the parking area and pumping a handful of rust-tasting water, and drinking it as avidly as if it could give me magic wisdom, youth, freedom, a tiny concubine. For a while, purple-robed, heel-dangling, I sat on the edge of one of the rude tables, under the wooshing pines. In the middle distance, two little maidens in shorts and halters came out of a sun-dappled privy marked "Women." Gum-chewing Mabel (or Mabel's understudy) laboriously, absent-mindedly, straddled a bicycle, and Marion, shaking her hair because of the flies, settled behind, legs wide apart; and, wobbling, they slowly, absently, merged with the light and shade. Lolita! Father and daughter melting into these woods! The natural solution was to destroy Mrs. Humbert. But how?</div>

<div class="line_en">No man can bring about the perfect murder; chance, however, can do it. There was the famous dispatch of a Mme Lacour in Arles, southern France, at the close of last century. An unidentified bearded six-footer, who, it was later conjectured, had been the lady's secret lover, walked up to her in a crowded street, soon after her marriage to Colonel Lacour, and mortally stabbed her in the back, three times, while the Colonel, a small bulldog of a man, hung onto the murderer's arm. By a miraculous and beautiful coincidence, right at the moment when the operator was in the act of loosening the angry little husband's jaws (while several onlookers were closing in upon the group), a cranky Italian in the house nearest to the scene set off by sheer accident some kind of explosive he was tinkering with, and immediately the street was turned into a pandemonium of smoke, falling bricks and running people. The explosion hurt no one (except that it knocked out game Colonel Lacour); but the lady's vengeful lover ran when the others ran -- and lived happily ever after.</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked down to Hourglass Lake. The spot from which we and a few other "nice" couples (the Farlows, the Chatfields) bathed was a kind of small cove; my Charlotte liked it because it was almost "a private beach." The main bathing facilities (or "drowning facilities" as the Ramsdale Journal had had occasion to say) were in the left (eastern) part of the hourglass, and could not be seen from our covelet. To our right, the pines soon gave way to a curve of marshland which turned again into forest on the opposite side.</div>

<div class="line_en">The short white-sand strip of "our" beach -- from which by now we had gone a little way to reach deep water -- was empty on weekday mornings. There was nobody around except those two tiny very busy figures on the opposite side, and a dark-red private plane that droned overhead, and then disappeared in the blue. The setting was really perfect for a brisk bubbling murder, and here was the subtle point: the man of law and the man of water were just near enough to witness an accident and just far enough not to observe a crime. They were near enough to hear a distracted bather thrashing about and bellowing for somebody to come and help him save his drowning wife; and they were too far to distinguish (if they happened to look too soon) that the anything but distracted swimmer was finishing to tread his wife underfoot. I was not yet at that stage; I merely want to convey the ease of the act, the nicety of the setting! So there was Charlotte swimming on with dutiful awkwardness (she was a very mediocre mermaid), but not without a certain solemn pleasure (for was not her merman by her side?); and as I watched, with the stark lucidity of a future recollection (you know -- trying to see things as you will remember having seen them), the glossy whiteness of her wet face so little tanned despite all her endeavors, and her pale lips, and her naked convex forehead, and the tight black cap, and the plump wet neck, I knew that all I had to do was to drop back, take a deep breath, then grab her by the ankle and rapidly dive with my captive corpse. I say corpse because surprise, panic and inexperience would cause her to inhale at once a lethal gallon of lake, while I would be able to hold on for at least a full minute, open-eyed under water. The fatal gesture passed like the tail of a falling star across the blackness of the contemplated crime. It was like some dreadful silent ballet, the male dancer holding the ballerina by her foot and streaking down through watery twilight. I might come up for a mouthful of air while still holding her down, and then would dive again as many times as would be necessary, and only when the curtain came down on her for good, would I permit myself to yell for help. And when some twenty minutes later the two puppets steadily growing arrived in a rowboat, one half newly painted, poor Mrs. Humbert Humbert, the victim of a cramp or coronary occlusion, or both, would be standing on her head in the inky ooze, some thirty feet below the smiling surface of Hourglass Lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的”海岸一条白色小沙滩——我们就是从那儿走进深水的，——周未的早晨总是空空荡荡。四周杳无人影，除了对面那两个忙忙叨叨的小人影，还有一架深红色私人飞机在头顶嗡叫，而后消失在蓝天深处。这背景对一场泡沫般的媒杀计划正可谓天衣无缝，更微妙的是：一名执法者和一个弄水人，近，正足以目睹此不幸事故，远，却看不出这是一次犯罪。他们完全能听见一位精神已经错乱的沐浴人上下翻滚大声呼叫人们来救救他溺死的妻子；但他们太远，分辨不清（如果他们恰好立刻望过来）正是那位精神错乱的沐浴人的脚下踩踏着他的妻子。但我还没到此地步；我只是想说明要想行动有多容易，当时环境多么美妙！夏洛特在那边克守职责地游着（她是那种很一般的善泳女人），并非毫无严肃的快乐（因为她身边不是她的善泳男士吗？）；当我带着为以后写回忆录而有的纯粹清醒看到（你知道——就是看事物时尽量想到你以后会记起曾见过它们）她湿漉漉、光滑又惨白的面容，虽已竭尽全力，仍然只晒黑了一点，看到她苍白的嘴唇，她裸露出来的脑门，以及黑色紧帽，以及帽下带水的玉颈，我知道，我需要做的只是重新跳出去，做一次深呼吸，然后抓住她的脚踝，迅速带着我俘虏的尸身潜下去。我说尸身是因为吃惊、慌乱和缺少经验会立刻吸入一加仑湖水当场毙命，同时我就能在水下睁大双目至少坚持整整一分钟。这残忍的动作象坠落的流星扫过密谋罪恶的暗夜。就象一出恐怖无声的芭蕾，男主角抓住女主角的脚在水纹似的微光中飞跑而去。我在把她往下拽的同时，还可以浮上来换口气，再潜入，需要多少次就来多少次，必要等大幕落到她身上才能呼喊救命。大约二十分钟以后，两个木偶会驾着刚漆过一半的划艇稳重地赶来，但可怜的亨伯特夫人，抽筋或冠状阻塞或二者并发的牺牲品，却已经倒悬在滴漏湖微波荡漾的水面下三十英尺的一片墨蓝色软泥上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the opposite bank, at least a thousand paces away (if one could walk across water), I could make out the tiny figures of two men working like beavers on their stretch of shore. I knew exactly who they were: a retired policeman of Polish descent and the retired plumber who owned most of the timber on that side of the lake. And I also knew they were engaged in building, just for the dismal fun of the thing, a wharf. The knocks that reached us seemed so much bigger than what could be distinguished of those dwarfs' arms and tools; indeed, one suspected the director of those acrosonic effects to have been at odds with the puppet-master, especially since the hefty crack of each diminutive blow lagged behind its visual version.</div>

<div class="line_en">She swam beside me, a trustful and clumsy seal, and all the logic of passion screamed in my ear: Now is the time! And, folks, I just couldn't! In silence I turned shoreward and gravely, dutifully, she also turned, and still hell screamed its counsel, and still I could not make myself drown the poor, slippery, big-bodied creature. The scream grew more and more remote as I realized the melancholy fact that neither tomorrow, nor Friday, nor any other day or night, could I make myself put her to death. Oh, I could visualize myself slapping Valeria's breasts out of alignment, or otherwise hurting her -- and I could see myself, no less clearly, shooting her lover in the underbelly and making him say "akh!" and sit down. But I could not kill Charlotte -- especially when things were on the whole not quite as hopeless, perhaps, as they seemed at first wince on that miserable morning. Were I to catch her by her strong kicking foot; were I to see her amazed look, hear her awful voice; were I still to go through with the ordeal, her ghost would haunt me all my life. Perhaps if the year were 1447 instead of 1947 I might have hoodwinked my gentle nature by administering her some classical poison from a hollow agate, some tender philter of death. But in our middle-class nosy era it would not have come off the way it used to in the brocaded palaces of the past. Nowadays you have to be a scientist if you want to be a killer. No, no, I was neither. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the majority of sex offenders that hanker for some throbbing, sweet-moaning, physical but not necessarily coital, relation with a girl-child, are innocuous, inadequate, passive, timid strangers who merely ask the community to allow them to pursue their practically harmless, so-called aberrant behavior, their little hot wet private acts of sexual deviation without the police and society cracking down upon them. We are not sex fiends! We do not rape as good soldiers do. We are unhappy, mild, dog-eyed gentlemen, sufficiently well integrated to control our urge in the presence of adults, but ready to give years and years of life for one chance to touch a nymphet. Emphatically, no killers are we. Poets never kill. Oh, my poor Charlotte, do not hate me in your eternal heaven among an eternal alchemy of asphalt and rubber and metal and stone -- but thank God, not water, not water!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在我旁边游着，一条忠诚又笨拙的海豹，所有感情的推理都在我耳畔尖叫：现在是时刻了！但，人们，我只是不能！我默默地转向海岸，她也笨重的、尽本份地转过去，见鬼，那忠告仍然尖叫着，而我，仍然不能忍心淹死那可怜的、光溜溜，骨胳粗大的造物。当我发现不论明天，还是星期五，还是任何一天的白天或晚上，我都不可能对她下毒手这个可悲的事实以后，那尖叫声才渐渐远去了。噢，我可以想见自己毫无规则地痛击瓦莱里亚的胸部或采取别的方法伤害她——我还可以同样清楚地眼见自己猛击她情夫的下腹，让他“喔！”地一声坐下去。但我不能杀夏洛特——尤其当事情或许还未完全象在那个悲哀的早晨做的第一次退缩那样无望。如果我去抓她健壮、踢腾的脚；如果我看见她惊恐的神色，听见她骇人的叫声；如果我仍按计划而行，她的死魂灵就会一辈子缠住我不放。如果这是一四四七年而不是一九四七年，我也许还能昧着我温和的天性给她配一颗假玛瑙的古典式毒药，一种柔和的死亡魔药。但在我们这个喧闹的中产阶级时代，其效果定不似它在昔日花团锦簇的宫廷里那般成功。今天，你想当杀人犯就必须是个科学家。不，不，我二者都不是。陪审团的女士们先生们，大多数渴望获得震颤又甜蜜的抱怨、与女孩子有身体关系但并不一定交欢的性罪犯，都是不正常的、被动的、怯懦的怪人，他们只要求社会允许他们追求他们实际上无害、所谓超出常规的行为，追求他们越轨的又小又热又湿又隐秘的性举动，不遭受警察和社会的严厉制裁。我们不是色情狂！我们从不象那些好士兵那样随意强奸。我们是不快活、阴郁但文雅的绅士，在成人面前完全可以控制我们的冲动，但为了抚模性感少女的机会却甘愿付出一年又一年的生命。应该强调的是，我们没有一个是杀人犯。诗人从不凶杀。噢！我可怜的夏洛特，在沥青和橡胶和金属和石头的永恒炼丹术中——感谢上帝，不是水，不是水！——你不要在你永恒的天堂里仇恨我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She said she loved me. She sighed deeply. She extended one arm and groped in the pocket of her robe for her cigarettes. She sat up and smoked. She examined her right shoulder.
