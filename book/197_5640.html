<div class="line_en">Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he'd christened "Fluffy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利、罗恩和赫敏早就知道海格对庞大的怪物情有独钟。他们去年在霍格沃茨期间，海格曾经试图在他的小木屋里养一条龙，还有那三个脑袋的、被他称为“路威”的大狗，也使他们很长时间不能忘记。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry half wished he hadn't found out how to work Riddle's diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he'd seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利甚至有点希望他没有发现怎样阅读里德尔的日记。罗恩和赫敏一遍遍地叫他讲述他的所见所闻，最后他讲得厌烦了，对之后没完没了的、车轱辘式的谈话也感到腻味透顶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs;</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当年，还是一个少年的海格，如果听说城堡的什么地方藏着一个怪物，哈利知道他肯定会想尽一切办法去看它一眼。海格很可能认为，把那怪物囚禁那么久很不像话，应该给它一个机会出来活动活动腿脚；">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his "Oh, Potter, you rotter" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们决定什么也不对海格说，除非又有攻击事件发生。随后，日子一天天过去了，再也没有听见那个幽灵发出的低语。他们乐观起来，以为永远用不着去问海格当年为什么被开除了。自从贾斯廷和差点没头的尼克被石化后，时间已经过去了四个月，似乎差不多每个人都认为那个攻击者，不管他是谁，已经永远洗手不干了。皮皮鬼终于唱腻了他那首“哦，波特，你这个讨厌鬼”。一天在上草药课时，厄尼礼貌地请哈利把一小桶跳动的伞菌递给他。三月里，几株曼德拉草在第三温室开了一个热热闹闹、吵吵嚷嚷的舞会，这使斯普劳特教授非常高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.</div>

Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody's advice but signed up for everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gryffindor's next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday's match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor's chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰芬多队的下一场魁地奇比赛是对赫奇帕奇队。伍德坚持让队员们每天晚饭后训练，所以哈利除了训练和完成家庭作业，几乎没有时间做别的。不过，训练越来越得心应手，或者至少不大淋雨了。在星期六比赛的前一天晚上，当他走到宿舍去放下飞天扫帚时，他觉得格兰芬多队从来没有像现在这样有把握赢得魁地奇杯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利想，如果他去跟弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈商量他在魔法方面的事业，他们还不知道会说什么呢。想到这里，他暗暗地苦笑。他并不是没有得到任何指导：珀西韦斯莱很迫切地向他言传身教。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Depends where you want to go, Harry," he said. "It's never too early to think about the future, so I'd recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they're thinking of working in close contact with them -- look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就看你想去什么地方了，哈利。”他说，“必须早点为将来打算，所以我向你推荐占卜术。人们说选择麻瓜研究是愚蠢的，但我个人认为，巫师应该对非魔法社会有一个全面彻底的了解，尤其是如果他们想从事与麻瓜联系密切的工作的话——你看我父亲，他每时每刻都必须与麻瓜的事务打交道。我哥哥查理一向喜欢在户外活动，所以他选择了保护神奇生物课。发挥你的强项，哈利。”">查看中文翻译</div>
