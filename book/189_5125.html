<div class="line_en">The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office. The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of summary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番话是向奥立弗发出的一道邀请，他一边说一边打开门，要奥立弗进去，在里边一间石砌的牢房里，奥立弗浑身上下给搜了一通，结果什么也没搜出来，门又锁上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up, elsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial charges -- the word is worth noting -- in dungeons, compared with which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried, found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who doubts this, compare the two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这间牢房的形状和大小都有些像地窖，只是没那么亮，里边龌龊得叫人受不了。眼下是星期一上午，打星期六夜里开始，这里关过六个醉汉，现在都关到别的地方去了。不过，这不是什么问题。在我们的警察局里，每天夜里都有无数男男女女因为芝麻绿豆大的罪名――这个说法真不算一回事――就给关进了地牢，与此相比，新门监狱那些经过审讯、定罪、宣判死刑的最最凶暴残忍的在押重罪犯的囚室简直算得上宫殿了。让怀疑这一点的人，无论是谁，来比较一下吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钥匙在锁孔里发出咔哒一声响，这时候，老绅士看上去几乎与奥立弗一样沮丧，他长叹了一口气，看了看手里的书，书是无辜的，然而所有的乱子又都是因它而起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is something in that boy's face," said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; "something that touches and interests me. Can he be innocent? He looked like -- Bye the bye," exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, "Bless my soul!-- where have I seen something like that look before?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那孩子长相上有一种什么东西，”老绅士若有所思地缓步踱到一边，用书的封皮敲击着自己的下颚，自言自语地说，“某种触动我、吸弓我的东西。他会不会是无辜的呢？他似乎有些像――这个，这个，”老绅士骤然停住了，两眼凝视着天空，紧接着又高声说道，“天啦――我从前在哪儿见过的，跟他的长相很相似？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there, retiring into a corner, called up before his mind's eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years. "No," said the old gentleman, shaking his head; "it must be imagination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老绅士沉吟了半晌，带着同样苦苦思索的神色走进后边一间面向院子的接待室，默默地走到一个角落，将多年来一直掩藏在沉沉大幕后边的无数张面孔唤回到心目中。“不，”他摇了摇头说，“这一定是想像。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又一次回顾这些面孔。他已经将它们召唤到了眼前，要把遮挡了它们如此之久的这层幕布重新拉上可不是件容易的事。一张张面孔，有亲友的，也有仇敌的，还有许多几乎已经完全不认识的面孔也不期而至地挤在人群中。往昔如花似玉的少女而今已到了风烛残年。有几张脸长眠在地下，已经变了样，可是心灵超越了死亡，使它们依旧像昔日一样美好，呼唤着当年炯炯的目光，爽朗的笑貌，透过躯壳的灵魂之光仿佛在娓娓低语，黄土底下的美虽然已面目全非，但却得到了升华，她超脱尘世，只是为了成为一盏明灯，在通往天国的路途上洒下一道柔和清丽的光辉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried them again in the pages of the musty book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老绅士到底没有想起谁的相貌与奥立弗有些相像。他长叹一声，向自己唤醒过来的往事告别，幸好他只是有些恍榴。老绅士把这一切重新埋进那本书的宇里行间，那本帮不上什么忙的书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人碰了一下他的肩膀，他顿时醒悟过来，拎钥匙的汉子要老绅士随他一道进法庭去。他赶紧合上书，当下便被领去拜见声威赫赫的范昂先生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="范昂先生很瘦，中等身材，腰板细长，脖子不大灵便。他头发不多，大都长在后脑勺和头的两侧。面容严厉而又红得过头了些。如果他确确实实没有饮酒无度的习惯，他完全可以起诉自己的长相犯有诽谤罪敲它一大笔损失费。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="范昂先生那功夫刚好正在研读当天早报上登载的一篇社论，文章谈到了他最近作出的一次裁决，第三百五十次提请内政大臣对他特别加以注意。他火透了，抬起头来的时候满脸的不高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="老绅士毕恭毕敬地鞠了一躬，朝推事的写字台走过去，递上一张名片，说道：“先生，这是我的姓名和住址。”说罢，他退后两步，又彬彬有礼地点了一下头，静候对方提问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty's subjects, expecially of the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily press.(Footnote: Or were virtually, then.)
