<div class="line_en">Our flight didn't leave until noon, but Mom woke me up at five thirty, turning on the light and shouting, "AMSTERDAM!" She ran around all morning making sure we had international plug adapters and quadruple-checking that we had the right number of oxygen tanks to get there and that they were all full, etc., while I just rolled out of bed, put on my Travel to Amsterdam Outfit (jeans, a pink tank top, and a black cardigan in case the plane was cold).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的航班中午才起飞，但妈妈早上五点半就把我叫醒了，她打开灯，大叫一声：“阿姆斯特丹！”整个早上她都跑来跑去确认我们带没带国际转换插头，检查了四五遍我们旅途带的氧气瓶数目是否无误，氧气是否全都装满了，等等。在此期间，我则滚下床来，穿上我的“阿姆斯特丹旅游行头”——牛仔裤，粉色紧身背心，还有一件黑色羊毛开衫，怕飞机上太冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I argued with Mom that I should have slightly more than half of the suitcase, since without me and my cancer, we'd never be going to Amsterdam in the first place. Mom countered that since she was twice as large as me and therefore required more physical fabric to preserve her modesty, she deserved at least two-thirds of the suitcase.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和妈妈据理力争，说我应该占旅行箱略多于一半的空间，因为说到底，要是没有我和我的癌症，我们根本就去不了阿姆斯特丹。妈妈迎头反击，说因为她的体积是我的两倍，她需要更多的实体织物来维持端庄得体，因此她至少有权占领旅行箱的三分之二。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We could only take one suitcase. I couldn't carry one, and Mom insisted that she couldn't carry two, so we had to jockey for space in this black suitcase my parents had gotten as a wedding present a million years ago, a suitcase that was supposed to spend its life in exotic locales but ended up mostly going back and forth to Dayton, where Morris Property, Inc., had a satellite office that Dad often visited.</div>

<div class="line_en">The car was packed by six fifteen, whereupon Mom insisted that we eat breakfast with Dad, although I had a moral opposition to eating before dawn on the grounds that I was not a nineteenth-century Russian peasant fortifying myself for a day in the fields. But anyway, I tried to stomach down some eggs while Mom and Dad enjoyed these homemade versions of Egg McMuffins they liked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六点一刻，行李都装上了车，妈妈坚持说我们应该和爸爸一起吃早饭，可是我从道义上反对天亮之前吃早餐，因为我又不是需要攒足体力在地里辛苦一天的十九世纪俄国农民。尽管如此，我还是设法往肚子里填了点鸡蛋，爸妈则美餐了一顿他们最喜欢的自制改良版鸡蛋“麦满分”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But why?" I asked. "I mean, seriously: How did scrambled eggs get stuck with breakfast exclusivity? You can put bacon on a sandwich without anyone freaking out. But the moment your sandwich has an egg, boom, it's a breakfast sandwich."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是到底为什么啊？”我问，“我是认真的，为什么炒鸡蛋一直就是早餐的专属材料？你可以用培根做三明治，谁也不会大惊小怪。但是一旦三明治里有鸡蛋，哟！那就成了‘早餐’三明治了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't want to have 'breakfast for dinner,'" I answered, crossing knife and fork over my mostly full plate.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想‘吃早餐的东西当晚餐’。”我答道，把刀叉交叉搁在我几乎没怎么动的盘子上，“我想吃炒鸡蛋当晚餐，但不想听这种荒谬的解释，说什么只要有炒鸡蛋就是早餐，即使晚上吃也一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After they finished eating, Dad did the dishes and walked us to the car. Of course, he started crying, and he kissed my cheek with his wet stubbly face. He pressed his nose against my cheekbone and whispered, "I love you. I'm so proud of you." (For what, I wondered.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们吃完之后，爸爸洗盘子，送我们去车上。当然，他哭了起来，吻了我的脸颊。他湿漉漉、满是胡茬的脸贴着我，鼻子抵在我的颧骨上，悄声说：“我爱你。我真为你骄傲。”（有什么可骄傲的？我在心里想。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mom and I drove over to Augustus's house, and when we got there, she wanted me to stay in the car to rest, but I went to the door with her anyway. As we approached the house, I could hear someone crying inside. I didn't think it was Gus at first, because it didn't sound anything like the low rumble of his speaking, but then I heard a voice that was definitely a twisted version of his say, "BECAUSE IT IS MY LIFE, MOM. IT BELONGS TO ME." And quickly my mom put her arm around my shoulders and spun me back toward the car, walking quickly, and I was like, "Mom, what's wrong?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈和我开车到奥古斯塔斯家，到了之后，她让我待在车里休息，但我坚持跟她一起往门口走去。走近他家的时候，我听到房子里有人在哭。一开始我没想到那是格斯，因为那声音和他平时说话的低沉声线完全不一样，可后来我听到一个绝对是他的但有些扭曲的声音说：“因为这是我的人生，妈妈，它属于我。”我妈妈飞快地伸出胳膊搂住我的肩，把我转了个方向，推着我往车那边快步走去，我说：“妈，出什么事了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we backed out of the driveway, I kept waving at him. He was waving back, and crying. It occurred to me that he was probably thinking he might never see me again, which he probably thought every single morning of his entire weekday life as he left for work, which probably sucked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在车道上倒车的时候我一直对他挥手，他也一直向我挥手，哭个不停。我突然想到，他很可能在想也许再也见不到我了，他很可能生命中的每一天早上出门上班时都这么想，而那很可能糟透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”过了一会儿妈妈说，“我们来得太早了，我猜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We stared at the house for a while. The weird thing about houses is that they almost always look like nothing is happening inside of them, even though they contain most of our lives. I wondered if that was sort of the point of architecture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们对他家的房子注目片刻。房子这东西有一点颇为诡异，就是虽然它们包容着我们绝大部分的生活，看起来却永远是一副里面什么也没有发生的样子。我想知道是否在一定程度上这就是建筑的意义所在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost as if I didn't have to get up at five thirty," I said. Mom reached down to the console between us, grabbed her coffee mug, and took a sip. My phone buzzed. A text from Augustus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说的好像逼我五点半就爬起来的人不是你似的。”我说。妈妈伸手到我们俩的座椅之间拿出咖啡杯，啜了一口。我的电话振动起来：奥古斯塔斯来了短信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We got back into the car and I texted Augustus that we were outside whenever he was ready.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just CAN'T decide what to wear. Do you like me better in a polo or a button-down?</div>

<div class="line_en">Thirty seconds later, the front door opened, and a smiling Augustus appeared, a roller bag behind him. He wore a pressed sky-blue button-down tucked into his jeans. A Camel Light dangled from his lips. My mom got out to say hi to him. He took the cigarette out momentarily and spoke in the confident voice to which I was accustomed. "Always a pleasure to see you, ma'am."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三十秒后，大门开了，奥古斯塔斯微笑着出现在门口，身后拖着带轮的旅行包。他穿着一件熨过的天蓝色纽扣领衬衫，下摆掖在牛仔裤里；嘴唇上，一根骆驼特醇香烟晃晃悠悠。我妈妈下车跟他打招呼，他暂时把烟拿下来，用我熟悉的那种自信十足的嗓音说：“见到您总是很高兴，夫人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rather than be searched by hand, I chose to walk through the metal detector without my cart or my tank or even the plastic nubbins in my nose. Walking through the X-ray machine marked the first time I'd taken a step without oxygen in some months, and it felt pretty amazing to walk unencumbered like that, stepping across the Rubicon, the machine's silence acknowledging that I was, however briefly, a nonmetallicized creature.</div>

<div class="line_en">Which was not quite true. The next stop was the airport parking lot, and then a bus took us to the terminal, and then an open-air electric car took us to the security line. The TSA guy at the front of the line was shouting about how our bags had better not contain explosives or firearms or anything liquid over three ounces, and I said to Augustus, "Observation: Standing in line is a form of oppression," and he said, "Seriously."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话并非完全准确。下一站是机场的停车场，然后有一辆大巴载我们去航站楼，然后是敞篷电瓶车送我们到安检通道。通道尽头，安全管理局的那家伙嚷嚷着说，我们的包里最好别有枪支啦弹药啦超过三盎司的液体啦，我跟奥古斯塔斯说：“观察评论：排队也是一种受压迫的方式。”他说：“千真万确。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I felt a bodily sovereignty that I can't really describe except to say that when I was a kid I used to have a really heavy backpack that I carried everywhere with all my books in it, and if I walked around with the backpack for long enough, when I took it off I felt like I was floating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得掌握了自己身体的主权，那种感觉很难准确描述。我只能说，小时候，我有一个特别沉重的大书包，走到哪儿都背着它，里面装着我所有的书。如果我背着包的时间太久，终于把它放下来时，我就会感觉自己快要飘起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even then, it hurt. The pain was always there, pulling me inside of myself, demanding to be felt. It always felt like I was waking up from the pain when something in the world outside of me suddenly required my comment or attention. Mom was looking at me, concerned. She'd just said something.

<div class="line_en">I felt bashful, like I had when I'd first told him of An Imperial Affliction. "Um, okay. Okay. 'Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, / The muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels / And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: / Streets that follow like a tedious argument / Of insidious intent / To lead you to an overwhelming question… / Oh, do not ask, "What is it?" / Let us go and make our visit.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得有些羞怯，就好像我第一次告诉他《无比美妙的痛苦》时候的感觉。“嗯，好吧，好吧。我们走吧，穿过一些半清冷的街，/那儿休憩的场所正人声喋喋；/有夜夜不宁的下等歇夜旅店/和满地蚌壳的铺锯末的饭馆：/街连着街，好像一场讨厌的争议/带着阴险的意图/要把你引向一个重大的问题……/唉，不要问，‘那是什么？’/让我们快点去作客。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was quiet for a minute, and then he asked, "You want to read or something?" I said sure. I was reading this long poem called Howl by Allen Ginsberg for my poetry class, and Gus was rereading An Imperial Affliction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一分钟的静默，然后他问：“你想看会儿书吗？”我说当然。我拿出诗歌课布置的一首长诗来读，是艾伦·金斯堡的《嚎叫》。格斯在重读《无比美妙的痛苦》。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm in love with you," he said quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我爱上你了。”他轻声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am," he said. He was staring at me, and I could see the corners of his eyes crinkling. "I'm in love with you, and I'm not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things. I'm in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust, and I know the sun will swallow the only earth we'll ever have, and I am in love with you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的。”他目不转睛地注视着我，可以看到他的眼角微微眯起，“我爱上你了，而剥夺自己说实话的简单乐趣——这种勾当我不打算干。我爱上你了，我知道爱只是虚空中的叫喊，我知道遗忘不可避免，我知道我们都注定在劫难逃，总有一天我们的一切努力都将重归尘土，我知道太阳会吞噬我们唯一拥有的地球，可我爱上你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Augustus," I said again, not knowing what else to say. It felt like everything was rising up in me, like I was drowning in this weirdly painful joy, but I couldn't say it back. I couldn't say anything back. I just looked at him and let him look at me until he nodded, lips pursed, and turned away, placing the side of his head against the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奥古斯塔斯。”我又叫了一声他的名字，因为不知道该说什么。我感觉似乎身体里的一切都造起反来，好像我就快要在这奇异的痛苦的欢乐中溺毙，但我无法回应他。我什么也说不出来，只是看着他，也任由他看着我。最后他点点头，抿起嘴唇，转过头，把头靠在舷窗上。">查看中文翻译</div>
