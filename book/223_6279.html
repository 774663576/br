<div class="line_en">Joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire; a quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of toasted oatcake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth. Catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself. I asked if the master was in? My question remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had grown deaf, and repeated it louder.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rainy night had ushered in a misty morning -- half frost, half drizzle and temporary brooks crossed our path -- gurgling from the uplands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things. We entered the farmhouse by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr Heathcliff were really absent; because I put slight faith in his own affirmation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal. The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one gone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably. We knew Linton's tones, and entered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to fall against one arm. He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph. It lasted so long that it frightened even me. As to his cousin, she wept, with all her might; aghast at the mischief she had done: though she said nothing. I held him till the fit exhausted itself.

<div class="line_en">She lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while; but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door and I followed. We were recalled by a scream. Linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can. I thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him. Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down, and cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.</div>

He's beginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will tonight, if I believe he is the worse for my visit; and then I dare not come again. Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I mustn't come, if I have hurt you.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，我们能！”凯蒂回答。“现在他好了，能忍着点啦。他在开始想到，如果我认为是我的来访才使他病重的话，那我今晚肯定会比他过得还要难受。那么我也就不敢再来了。说实话吧，林惇；要是我弄痛了你，我就不能来啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Catherine repeated the longest she could remember. The employment pleased both mightily.

<div class="line_cn" title="凯瑟琳背诵她所能记住的最长的一首。这件事使他俩都很愉快。林惇又要再来一个，完了又再来一个，丝毫不顾我拚命反对；这样他们一直搞到钟打了十二点，我们听见哈里顿在院子里，他回来吃中饭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`I can get over the wall,' she said, laughing. `The Grange is not a prison, Ellen, and you are not my jailer. And besides, I'm almost seventeen: I'm a woman. And I'm certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him. I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser: less childish, am I not? And he'll soon do as I direct him, with some slight coaxing. He's a pretty little darling when he's good. I'd make such a pet of him, if he were mine. We should never quarrel, should we, after we were used to each other? Don't you like him, Ellen?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我能爬墙，”她笑着说，“田庄不是监牢，艾伦，你也不是我的看守。再说，我快十七岁啦，我是一个女人。我担保如果林惇有我去照应他，他的身体会很快好起来。我比他大，你知道，也聪明点，孩子气少些，不是吗？稍微来点甜言蜜语，他就会听我的了。当他好好的时候，他是个漂亮的小宝贝哩。如果他是我家里人，我要把他当个宝贝。我们永远不吵架，等我们彼此熟悉了，我们还会吵吗？你不喜欢他吗，艾伦？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Like him?' I exclaimed. `The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens. Happily, as Mr Heathcliff conjectured, he'll not win twenty. I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed. And small loss to his family whenever he drops off. And lucky it is for us that his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and selfish he'd be. I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a husband, Miss Catherine.'</div>

<div class="line_en">`Well, well,' I cried, `after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for listen, miss, and mind, I'll keep my word,-- if you attempt going to Wuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr Linton, and, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived.'</div>

<div class="line_en">`He's younger than I,' she answered, after a protracted pause of meditation, `and he ought to live the longest: he will -- he must live as long as I do.

<div class="line_en">We both reached home before our dinner time; my master supposed we had been wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence. As soon as I entered, I hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings; but sitting such a while at the Heights had done the mischief. On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three weeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity never experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say, since.</div>

<div class="line_en">My little mistress behaved like an angel, in coming to wait on me, and cheer my solitude: the confinement brought me exceedingly low. It is wearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for complaint than I had. The moment Catherine left Mr Linton's room, she appeared at my bedside. Her day was divided between us; no amusement usurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched. She must have had a warm heart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me. I said her days were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I generally needed nothing after six o'clock; thus the evening was her own. Poor thing! I never considered what she did with herself after tea. And though frequently, when she looked in to bid me good night, I remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers; instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors, I laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的小女主人表现得如天使一般，来侍候我，在我寂寞时来使我愉快。这种禁闭使我的情绪很低沉。对于一个忙碌好动的人，真感到无聊极了。可是和人家相比，我简直没什么理由可抱怨的。凯瑟琳一离开林惇先生的屋子，就出现在我的床边。她一天的时间全分给我们两个人了；没有一分钟是玩掉的：吃饭、读书和游戏她都不放在心上，真是位难得的、讨人喜的看护。在她这么爱她的父亲时，还能这么关心我，她必然是有颗热情的心。我说过她一天的时间全分给我们两个人了；但是主人休息得很早，我通常在六点钟以后也不需要什么，如此晚上就是她自己的了。可怜的东西！我从来没想到在吃茶以后她去作什么了。虽然时不时地，当她进来望望我，跟我道声晚安时，我看见她的脸上有一种鲜艳的色彩，她的纤细的手指也略微泛红。但我没想到这颜色是因为冒着严寒骑马过旷野而来，却以为是因为在书房烤火的缘故哩。">查看中文翻译</div>
