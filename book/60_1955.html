<div class="line_en">There was not a word, of course, about its being a politely worded plea for the release of political prisoners. None of the papers cited a single sentence from the short text. Instead, they went on at great length and in vague, menacing terms about an anti-state proclamation meant to lay the foundation for a new campaign against socialism. They also listed all the signatories, accompanying each of their names with slanderous attacks that gave Tomas gooseflesh.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not that it was unexpected.

<div class="line_en">Staring impotently across a courtyard, at a loss for what to do; hearing the pertinacious rumbling of one's own stomach during a moment of love; betraying, yet lacking the will to abandon the glamorous path of betrayal; raising one's fist with the crowds in the Grand March; displaying one's wit before hidden microphones -- I have known all these situations, I have experienced them myself, yet none of them has given rise to the person my curriculum vitae and I represent. The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them. Each one has crossed a border that I myself have circumvented. It is that crossed border (the border beyond which my own I ends) which attracts me most. For beyond that border begins the secret the novel asks about. The novel is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in the trap the world has become. But enough. Let us return to Tomas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无能为力地朝院子里张望，怎么也无法做出决定；在爱的激奋时刻听到自己的肚子一个劲地咕咕作响；背叛，且不知该如何在那条如此美丽的背叛之路上止步；在伟大的进军行列中举起拳头；在警察藏匿的麦克风前卖弄自己的幽默感等等。我知道这一切的情形，自己也都经历过。然而，小说人物并非产生于我的履历表中的任何一种情景。我小说中的主人公是我自己未曾实现的可能性。我爱所有的主人公，并且所有主人公都令我同样地恐惧，原因就在于此。他们，这些人物或那些人物，跨越了界限，而我只是绕了过去。这条被跨越的界限（我的“我”终结于界限的那一边）吸引着我。小说要探寻的奥秘仅在另外一边开始。小说不是作家的忏悔，而是对于陷入尘世陷阱的人生的探索。说得够多了。让我们回到托马斯身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This is the image from which he was born. As I have pointed out before, characters are not born like people, of woman; they are born of a situation, a sentence, a metaphor containing in a nutshell a basic human possibility that the author thinks no one else has discovered or said something essential about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他就产生于这一形象。就像我曾说过的，小说人物不像生物那样诞生自母体，而是产生于一种情境，一个语句，一个隐喻。隐喻中包含了一种处于萌芽状态的人生的基本可能性，在作家的想象中，它只是还未被发现，或人们还未论及它的实质。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he tried again to think through what he should have done. Even though he did his best to put aside everything belonging to the realm of the emotions (the admiration he had for the editor and the irritation his son caused him), he was still not sure whether he ought to have signed the text they gave him.</div>

<div class="line_en">After all, the press (totally manipulated by the state) could have kept it quiet and no one would have been the wiser.

<div class="line_en">Alone in his flat, he stared across the courtyard at the dirty walls of the building opposite. He missed the tall, stooped man with the big chin and the man's friends, whom he did not know, who were not even members of his circle. He felt as though he had just met a beautiful woman on a railway platform, and before he could say anything to her, she had stepped into a sleeping car on its way to Istanbul or Lisbon.</div>

<div class="line_en">And again he thought the thought we already know: Human life occurs only once, and the reason we cannot determine which of our decisions are good and which bad is that in a given situation we can make only one decision; we are not granted a second, third, or fourth life in which to compare various decisions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再次冒出那个我们已经知晓的念头：人只能活一回，我们无法验证决定的对错，因为，在任何情况下，我们只能做一个决定。上天不会赋予我们第二次、第三次、第四次生命以供比较不同的决定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In 1618, the Czech estates took courage and vented their ire on the emperor reigning in Vienna by pitching two of his high officials out of a window in the Prague Castle. Their defiance led to the Thirty Years War, which in turn led to the almost complete destruction of the Czech nation. Should the Czechs have shown more caution than courage? The answer may seem simple; it is not.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three hundred and twenty years later, after the Munich Conference of 1938, the entire world decided to sacrifice the Czechs' country to Hitler. Should the Czechs have tried to stand up to a power eight times their size? In contrast to 1618, they opted for caution. Their capitulation led to the Second World War, which in turn led to the forfeit of their nation's freedom for many decades or even centuries. Should they have shown more courage than caution? What should they have done?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三百二十年过去了，到一九三八年，即慕尼黑会议之后，整个世界决定将捷克人的国家牺牲给希特勒。他们是否该奋起反抗，和数量是他们八倍的敌人孤身奋战？与一六一八年的所作所为相反，较之勇气，他们表现出更多的谨慎。他们的投降标志着第二次世界大战的开始，结果是彻底丧失了作为一个民族的自由，几十年甚至几百年。较之谨慎，他们是否更需要勇气？到底该怎么做？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Einmal ist keinmal. What happens but once might as well not have happened at all. The history of the Czechs will not be repeated, nor will the history of Europe. The history of the Czechs and of Europe is a pair of sketches from the pen of mankind's fateful inexperience. History is as light as individual human life, unbearably light, light as a feather, as dust swirling into the air, as whatever will no longer exist tomorrow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once more, and with a nostalgia akin to love, Tomas thought of the tall, stooped editor. That man acted as though history were a finished picture rather than a sketch. He acted as though everything he did were to be repeated endlessly, to return eternally, without the slightest doubt about his actions. He was convinced he was right, and for him that was a sign not of narrowmindedness but of virtue. Yes, that man lived in a history different from Tomas's: a history that was not (or did not realize it was) a sketch.</div>
