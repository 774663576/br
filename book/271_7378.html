<div class="line_en">The flight to South America was long but comfortable in the wide first-class seat, with Edward's arms cradled around me. I slept myself out and awoke unusually alert as we circled toward the airport with the light of the setting sun slanting through the plane's windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">We didn't stay in the airport to connect with another flight as I'd expected. Instead we took a taxi through the dark, teeming, living streets of Rio. Unable to understand a word of Edward's Portuguese instructions to the driver, I guessed that we were off to find a hotel before the next leg of our journey. A sharp twinge of something very close to stage fright twisted in the pit of my stomach as I considered that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们并没有像我预期那样在机场等待下一班飞机。取而代之的是，我们乘坐出租车穿过了漆黑、拥挤、热闹的里约热内卢市区。爱德华用葡萄牙语向司机下达了指示，我一个字都听不懂，我猜我们大概是在下一段艰难旅程开始前，先驱往某个酒店休憩。就在我考虑这个问题的时候，这种近乎惊恐的想法让我的胃感到一阵钻心的疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I watched in silence while he prepared the boat for departure, surprised at how skilled and comfortable he seemed, because he'd never mentioned an interest in boating before. But then again, he was good at just about everything.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we headed due east into the open ocean, I reviewed basic geography in my head. As far as I could remember, there wasn't much east of Brazil… until you got to Africa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们面向东面进入了开放海域，我复习了下脑海中的地理知识，如果没有记错，巴西的东面好像就没有什么地方了，除非我们是去非洲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The taxi continued through the swarming crowds until they thinned somewhat, and we appeared to be nearing the extreme western edge of the city, heading into the ocean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出租车继续在川流不息的人群中向前行驶着，直到了某个人烟稀少的地方。我们似乎来到了了城市的最西边，那里延伸出去就是海洋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward led the way down the long line of white yachts moored in the night-blackened water. The boat he stopped at was smaller than the others, sleeker, obviously built for speed instead of space. Still luxurious, though, and more graceful than the rest. He leaped in lightly, despite the heavy bags he carried. He dropped those on the deck and turned to help me carefully over the edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华领我走过一排长长的泊在漆黑的水面上的白色游艇。他在一条较小但更为时髦的船只前停下了脚步，牺牲了空间更追求速度。感觉仍然非常奢华，比其余船只都显得更为高贵。尽管提着很重的袋子，Edward矫健地跃入船中，把袋子搁在甲板上，然后小心地帮我登上船舷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Edward sped forward while the lights of Rio faded and ultimately disappeared behind us. On his face was a familiar exhilarated smile, the one produced by any form of speed. The boat plunged through the waves and I was showered with sea spray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着爱德华的提速，里约热内卢的灯光在我们身后很快就黯淡下去，最终消失了。速度带来的快感，让他脸上浮现了一抹兴奋的笑容。快艇像箭一样披波前行，我也被溅起的海水洗了个淋浴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw only blackness at first, and the moon's white trail across the water. But I searched the space where he pointed until I found a low black shape breaking into the sheen of moonlight on the waves. As I squinted into the darkness, the silhouette became more detailed. The shape grew into a squat, irregular triangle, with one side trailing longer than the other before sinking into the waves. We drew closer, and I could see the outline was feathery, swaying to the light breeze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起先，我只能看到黑暗，和水面上撒下的洁白月光。我朝着他所指的方向努力搜寻着，终于看见水面上有个低矮的黑色影子挡住了月亮的光泽。我眯起眼睛，这个黑色的剪影变得愈发清晰起来。蹲伏着的轮廓看起来像是个不规则的三角形，一边比另一边来得更缓，一直延伸到水中。我们又靠近了些，这次我可以在微风的摇曳中的羽毛状线条了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"About another half hour." His eyes took in my hands, clenched on the seat, and he grinned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再半个小时就好。”他看到我放在座位上的手攥得紧紧，狡洁地笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where are we?" I murmured in wonder while he shifted course, heading around to the north end of the island.</div>

<div class="line_en">He heard me, despite the noise of the engine, and smiled a wide smile that gleamed in the moonlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boat slowed dramatically, drawing with precision into position against a short dock constructed of wooden planks, bleached into whiteness by the moon. The engine cut off, and the silence that followed was profound. There was nothing but the waves, slapping lightly against the boat, and the rustle of the breeze in the palms. The air was warm, moist, and fragrant -- like the steam left behind after a hot shower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船一下子减慢了速度，精确地靠上了一个小小的码头，这个码头铺着木头的栈道，被月光染上了一层白色。关掉引擎，剩下的只有深远的寂静。只有海浪轻轻拍打着船身，和微风抚过棕榈叶间发出的沙沙声。空气温暖、湿润、弥漫着清香——就像洗完热水澡后残留下的水蒸气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a short while it was pitch black in the jungle-like growth, and then I could see a warm light ahead. It was about at the point when I realized the light was a house -- the two bright, perfect squares were wide windows framing a front door -- that the stage fright attacked again, more forcefully than before, worse than when I'd thought we were headed for a hotel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一小会儿，我误以为我们是来到了丛林，但是接着我就看到了尽头的一点灯光。等我意识到这光是从一幢房子中发出来的，差不多我们已经到了门口了。两束明亮，正方形的灯光是从前门这边的窗户中透出的。我又有些怯场了，知道我们来的并不是旅馆后，症状比之前更为严重了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gripping the handles of both huge steamer trunks in one hand and cradling me in the other arm, he carried me up the dock and onto a pale sand pathway through the dark vegetation.</div>

<div class="line_en">He carried me through the house, both of us very quiet, flipping on lights as he went. My vague impression of the house was that it was quite large for a tiny island, and oddly familiar. I'd gotten used to the pale-on-pale color scheme preferred by the Cullens; it felt like home. I couldn't focus on any specifics, though. The violent pulse beating behind my ears made everything a little blurry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抱着我巡视屋子，我们两个都非常安静，他一边走一边把灯打开。我对于这栋房子含糊的记忆就是对于一个小岛来说，它过于宽敞了；还有种奇怪的熟悉感，我应该要开始习惯卡伦家偏爱的淡色系了，有种家的感觉。我没有办法把精力放在其他细节上，耳根后狂乱地脉搏冲击让一切都显得有些朦胧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was big and white, and the far wall was mostly glass -- standard decor for my vampires. Outside, the moon was bright on white sand and, just a few yards away from the house, glistening waves. But I barely noted that part. I was more focused on the absolutely huge white bed in the center of the room, hung with billowy clouds of mosquito netting.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took a couple of deep breaths and then went to the mirrors above the long stretch of counters. I looked exactly like I'd been sleeping on a plane all day. I found my brush and yanked it harshly through the snarls on the back of my neck until they were smoothed out and the bristles were full of hair. I brushed my teeth meticulously, twice. Then I washed my face and splashed water on the back of my neck, which was feeling feverish. That felt so good that I washed my arms as well, and finally I decided to just give up and take the shower. I knew it was ridiculous to shower before swimming, but I needed to calm down, and hot water was one reliable way to do that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又做了几次深呼吸，接着走到悬挂于一长排柜子之上的镜子前。我看起来确实像在飞机上已经睡了一整天的样子。我找到了我的梳子，我急躁地梳理起在背后打结了的头发，直到它们顺滑为止，梳子上满是扯下的头发。我异常仔细地刷了两遍牙。接着我洗了脸，并把水敷在了我那发烫的脖颈上。感觉还不错，于是我又开始洗我的胳膊，但是最后还是放弃了，决定去洗个淋浴。我知道在游泳前沐浴是一个很荒谬的做法，但我需要冷静，热水可以帮我放松。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Giving up, I went to the bathroom and peeked out through the long windows that opened to the same beach as the French doors. I couldn't see him; I guessed he was there in the water, not bothering to come up for air. In the sky above, the moon was lopsided, almost full, and the sand was bright white under its shine. A small movement caught my eye -- draped over a bend in one of the palm trees that fringed the beach, the rest of his clothes were swaying in the light breeze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我放弃了，走到浴室，那里长长的玻璃和法式门一样都面向同一片沙滩，我偷瞄了眼窗外，但没有看到他。我猜他一定在水里，反正他也不需要浮上来换气。头顶上皓月当空，把沙滩照耀地一片洁白明亮。一个细小的移动引起了我的注意——沙滩边缘的一颗棕榈树上挂着一样什么东西，原来是他剩下的衣物正在清风中微微飘荡。">查看中文翻译</div>

The pallid light of the moon turned his skin a perfect white, like the sand, like the moon itself, and made his wet hair black as the ocean. He was motionless, his hands resting palms down against the water; the low waves broke around him as if he were a stone.

<div class="line_en">I couldn't hear the sound of my footsteps as I walked to the water's edge, but I guessed that he could. Edward did not turn.

I stepped in, walking carefully across the invisible ocean floor, but my care was unnecessary; the sand continued perfectly smooth, sloping gently toward Edward.

<div class="line_en">"I'll never get this all out of my hair!" I pointed to my head, where it looked like a chicken was nesting. I started picking at the feathers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我永远都会清理不干净这些羽毛的！”我指指我想就像鸡窝的脑袋。我开始着手拔羽毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This isn't going to work," I sighed after a minute. "It's all dried in. I'm going to have to try to wash it out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不管用，”过了一分钟我叹气说。“都扎在里面了。我看看能不能把它们洗掉吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was mostly feather-free and dressed in an unfamiliar white cotton dress that concealed the worst of the violet blotches, I padded off barefoot to where the smell of eggs and bacon and cheddar cheese was coming from.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总算把羽毛去除的差不多了，我穿上件陌生的白色棉质连身裙，把一些最严重的青紫斑点掩盖在下面。我赤着脚啪嗒啪嗒地往鸡蛋，培根还有Cheddar乳酪发出香味的地方走过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'd better find some food for you," he said in a quiet voice, and he gently unwound my arms. I sighed as he disappeared, moving too fast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还是帮你准备些吃的吧，”他冷静地说，温柔地挣脱了我的手。他以极快的速度逃一般地消失了，我小叹了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here," he said. He turned with a smile on his face and set the plate on a small tiled table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“过来，”他对我说。他微笑着把盘子放在了餐桌了上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sat in one of the two metal chairs and started snarfing down the hot eggs. They burned my throat, but I didn't care.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华站在不锈钢烤箱前面，正将一个煎鸡蛋盛进料理台上一个浅蓝色的盘子里。我深深被食物的香气所吸引。我觉得我甚至可以连那个盘子和法兰铁盘都吞下去，我的胃在怒吼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I asked the cleaning crew to stock the kitchen. A first, for this place. I'll have to ask them to deal with the feathers…" He trailed off, his gaze fixed on a space above my head. I didn't respond, trying to avoid saying anything that would upset him again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," I told him. I leaned across the table to kiss him. He kissed me back automatically, and then suddenly stiffened and leaned away.</div>
