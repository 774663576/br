<div class="line_en">That did not surprise me in the least. Ralph, I should say, is out with a girl most nights of his life. But I did rather wonder that he chose to indulge in the pastime in King's Abbot instead of in the gay Metropolis.</div>

<div class="line_en">The house next door, The Larches, has recently been taken by a stranger. To Caroline's extreme annoyance, she has not been able to find out anything about him, except that he is a foreigner. The Intelligence Corps has proved a broken reed. Presumably the man has milk and vegetables and joints of meat and occasional whitings just like everybody else, but none of the people who make it their business to supply these things seem to have acquired any information. His name, apparently, is Mr Porrott -- a name which conveys an odd feeling of unreality. The one thing we do know about him is that he is interested in the growing of vegetable marrows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔壁那座房子名叫“落叶松”，最近刚搬进一个陌生人。令卡洛琳怒不可遏的是，她根本打听不出此人的任何信息，只知道他是个外国佬。她的智囊团也同样铩羽而归。按理说这个人应该也和别人一样，需要牛奶、蔬菜、里脊肉什么的，偶尔还吃点鳕鱼，但时常给他送货的人似乎都没捕获到什么情报。大家只知道他名叫波罗特先生——这名字有种说不清道不明的不真实感。不过据了解，他喜欢种西葫芦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flora Ackroyd is, of course, no relation whatever really to Ralph Paton but Ralph has been looked upon for so long as practically Ackroyd's own son, that cousinship is taken for granted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，弗洛拉·艾克罗伊德事实上和拉尔夫·佩顿没有血缘关系。但多年来人们一直将拉尔夫视为艾克罗伊德的亲生儿子，那么这两人自然是堂兄妹了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear Caroline," I said. "There's no doubt at all about what the man's profession has been. He's a retired hairdresser. Look at that moustache of his."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的卡洛琳，”我说，“那个人的职业清清楚楚，是个退休的理发师。他那八字胡就说明一切了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't make him out at all," she said in an aggrieved voice. "I borrowed some garden tools the other day, and he was most polite, but I couldn't get anything out of him. I asked him point blank at last whether he was a Frenchman, and he said he wasn't -- and, somehow, I didn't like to ask him any more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这人真是捉摸不透。”她满腹委屈地诉说着，“前几天我找他借几件园艺工具，他倒是很客气，但口风特别严实，什么都打听不到。最后我只好直接问他是不是法国人，他说不是——然后我就再也问不下去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that is certainly not the sort of information that Caroline is after. She wants to know where he comes from, what he does, whether he is married, what his wife was, or is, like, whether he has children, what his mother's maiden name was -- and so on. Somebody very like Caroline must have invented the questions on passports, I think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但卡洛琳所看重的自然不是这类情报。她想弄清楚波罗特先生从哪里来，做什么工作，结婚了没有，妻子（无论亡故与否）是谁，有没有孩子，他母亲婚前娘家姓什么——诸如此类。能编出护照上那一大串问题的人，估计和卡洛琳心有灵犀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caroline dissented. She said that if the man was a hairdresser, he would have wavy hair -- not straight. All hairdressers did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡洛琳不同意，她说如果那家伙是理发师，一定会留一头鬈发，而不是直发。所有理发师都不例外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to be more interested in our mysterious neighbour. A man who is capable of shutting up Caroline and sending her, like the Queen of Sheba, empty away, must be something of a personality.</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw a meditated loan and the opportunity of further questioning gleaming from her eye. I saw the chance to escape into the garden. I am rather fond of gardening. I was busily exterminating dandelion roots when a shout of warning sounded from close by and a heavy body whizzed by my ears and fell at my feet with a repellent squelch. It was a vegetable marrow!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="见她陷入沉思，我就知道她又再度发现登门打探的好机会了，便趁机溜去花园。我向来喜欢摆弄花花草草。正忙着把蒲公英连根拔起时，突然有人高声示警，旋即一个沉甸甸的东西从耳畔飞过，扑通一声重重砸在脚边。居然是个西葫芦！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked up angrily. Over the wall, to my left, there appeared a face. An egg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two immense moustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes. It was our mysterious neighbour, Mr Porrott.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我气冲冲地抬起头，左侧墙头上探出一张脸。我看到一颗蛋形脑袋，上头点缀着几绺来路不明的黑发，脸上有两撇浓密的八字胡，一对机警的眼珠。这就是我们的神秘邻居，波罗特先生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He broke at once into fluent apologies. "I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defence. For some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly I enrage myself with these marrows. I send them to promenade themselves -- alas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over the wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">Before such profuse apologies, my anger was forced to melt. After all, the wretched vegetable hadn't hit me. But I sincerely hoped that throwing large vegetables over walls was not our new friend's hobby. Such a habit could hardly endear him to us as a neighbour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="都道歉到这份上了，也由不得我不消气。无论如何，这可怜的西葫芦并没砸到我。不过我衷心盼望这位新朋友还没养成将大棵蔬菜掷过墙头的癖好，否则他绝不可能成为我们的好邻居。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="古里古怪的小矮子好像看穿了我的心思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah! no," he exclaimed. "Do not disquiet yourself. It is not with me a habit. But you can figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work towards a certain object, may labour and toil to attain a certain kind of leisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns for the old busy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself so glad to leave?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊！不，”他惊呼道，“不必多虑，我可没这种习惯。但您大可设身处地想一想，先生，辛辛苦苦奋斗大半辈子，好容易才能享享清福，却发现到头来还惦记着当初奔波劳顿的日子。原本巴不得一脚踹开的那份工作，现在却割舍不下，这该是什么滋味？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," I said slowly. "I fancy that that is a common enough occurrence. I myself am perhaps an instance. A year ago I came into a legacy -- enough to enable me to realize a dream. I have always wanted to travel, to see the world. Well, that was a year ago, as I said, and -- I am still here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”我慢条斯理地答道，“这也是人之常情。就拿我来说吧，一年前偶然继承了一笔遗产，足以帮助我实现梦想——我一直都渴望去旅游，看看外面的世界。哎，那都是一年前的事了，现在嘛——我还留在这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My little neighbour nodded. "The chains of habit. We work to attain an object, and the object gained, we find that what we miss is the daily toil. And mark you, monsieur, my work was interesting work. The most interesting work there is in the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小矮子邻居点点头：“习惯会束缚人的手脚。我们努力工作只为了那么一个目标，如愿以偿之后，却又开始怀念日复一日的劳碌生活。不瞒您说，我的工作特别有趣，称得上全世界最有意思的工作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

As my new friend of this morning had declared, he was extraordinarily handsome. Just on six feet, perfectly proportioned, with the easy grace of an athlete, he was dark, like his mother, with a handsome, sunburnt face always ready to break into a smile. Ralph Paton was of those born to charm easily and without effort. He was self-indulgent and extravagant, with no veneration for anything on earth, but he was lovable nevertheless, and his friends were all devoted to him.</div>
