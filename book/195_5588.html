<div class="line_en">When Philip rang a head was put out of the window, and in a minute he heard a noisy clatter on the stairs as the children ran down to let him in. It was a pale, anxious, thin face that he bent down for them to kiss. He was so moved by their exuberant affection that, to give himself time to recover, he made excuses to linger on the stairs. He was in a hysterical state and almost anything was enough to make him cry. They asked him why he had not come on the previous Sunday, and he told them he had been ill; they wanted to know what was the matter with him; and Philip, to amuse them, suggested a mysterious ailment, the name of which, double-barrelled and barbarous with its mixture of Greek and Latin (medical nomenclature bristled with such), made them shriek with delight. They dragged Philip into the parlour and made him repeat it for their father's edification. Athelny got up and shook hands with him. He stared at Philip, but with his round, bulging eyes he always seemed to stare, Philip did not know why on this occasion it made him self-conscious.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a look of concern on her face which made Philip uncomfortable. He forced a laugh and answered that he was not at all hungry. Sally came in to lay the table, and Philip began to chaff her. It was the family joke that she would be as fat as an aunt of Mrs. Athelny, called Aunt Elizabeth, whom the children had never seen but regarded as the type of obscene corpulence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip thought he was ravenous till he began to eat, but then discovered that his stomach turned against food, and he could eat hardly at all. His brain was weary; and he did not notice that Athelny, contrary to his habit, spoke very little. Philip was relieved to be sitting in a comfortable house, but every now and then he could not prevent himself from glancing out of the window. The day was tempestuous. The fine weather had broken; and it was cold, and there was a bitter wind; now and again gusts of rain drove against the window. Philip wondered what he should do that night. The Athelnys went to bed early, and he could not stay where he was after ten o'clock. His heart sank at the thought of going out into the bleak darkness. It seemed more terrible now that he was with his friends than when he was outside and alone. He kept on saying to himself that there were plenty more who would be spending the night out of doors. He strove to distract his mind by talking, but in the middle of his words a spatter of rain against the window would make him start.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普本以为饭一上桌，自己必会像头饿狼似的大嚼大咽，可真等吃起来，才发现自己早已没了胃口，什么都咽不下去。他的脑子很累，甚至没注意到身旁的阿西尔尼一反常态，在饭桌上出奇地安静。坐在舒舒服服的屋子里，菲利普整个人都放松下来，却总忍不住要往窗外瞅瞅。只见外面风狂雨骤，冷意森森。好天气到了头。阵阵冷风袭来，忽而挟着雨水劈头盖脸地砸在窗子上。他不知道晚上能去哪儿住。阿西尔尼一家睡觉很早，他最晚待到十点就要离开。一想要走进那漆黑的夜晚，他的心就深深沉了下去。一人在外漂泊似乎还可以忍受，反倒是和朋友相聚的温暖让他觉得酸楚不堪。他不断麻痹自己：除了他以外，还有不少人都得在外面过夜呢。他企图通过大侃特侃的方式让自己分散精力，但有时话说到一半，忽然就被一阵砸到窗上的雨点吓得大惊失色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was afraid he was going to cry. He felt very weak. He shut his eyes and frowned, trying to control himself. He felt a sudden flash of anger with Athelny because he would not leave him alone; but he was broken; and presently, his eyes still closed, slowly in order to keep his voice steady, he told him the story of his adventures during the last few weeks. As he spoke it seemed to him that he had behaved inanely, and it made it still harder to tell. He felt that Athelny would think him an utter fool.</div>
