<div class="line_en">It was a sunny day in October 1579 when I first met Will, just outside Stratford, near a big field of apple trees. I saw a boy up in one of the trees. He had red hair and looked about two years older than me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我第一次遇见威尔是在1579年10月的一天。那天，阳光明媚，就在斯特拉福镇外一座大苹果园附近，我看见有棵苹果树上坐着一位小男孩，长着红棕色头发，看模样大概大我两岁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Will was fifteen, and lived in Henley Street, he told me. His father was John Shakespeare, and he had a sister, Joan, and two younger brothers, Gilbert and Richard. There was another sister who died, I learnt later. And the next year he had another brother, little Edmund -- the baby of the family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔告诉我，他15岁，住在亨里街。家中有父亲约翰·莎士比亚，妹妹琼和两个弟弟，吉尔伯特和理查。我后来听说他另有一位姐姐死了。第二年他又添了一个弟弟——威尔家的赤子小埃德蒙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Will and I ran like the wind and only stopped when we reached the river. We sat down to eat our apples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔和我见势撒腿就跑，一口气跑到河边才坐下来吃苹果。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那可是纳什农场主的苹果，”我说，“如果他发现了，就要放狗咬你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next minute I was up the tree with him. But Will was wrong. Farmer Nash wasn't at the market, and a few minutes later we saw his angry red face above the wall on the far side of the field.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一会儿我也上了树。但是威尔错了，纳什先生并没去集市，几分钟后我们看见果园那端墙头露出一张气得发红的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我真为他难过。“这难道不乏味吗？”我问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sometimes. Usually it's all right." He lay back and put his hands behind his head. "But we have to read and learn all these Latin writers. I want to read modern writers, and English writers, like Geoffrey Chaucer. Can you read?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“偶尔有这种感觉，不过通常觉得学校的生活也不错。”他仰身躺下，双手枕着头，“在学校，我们不得不学习所有那些拉丁作家的作品。可我只想阅读现代作家和英国作家的作品，比如杰弗利·乔叟。你会看书吗？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
