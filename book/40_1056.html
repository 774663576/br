<div class="line_en">Sometimes she caught Rasheed looking at Aziza in the most peculiar way. The other night, sitting on the bedroom floor, where he was shaving a corn from his foot, he said quite casually, "So what was it like between you two?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Of all earthly pleasures, Laila's favorite was lying next to Aziza, her baby's face so close that she could watch her big pupils dilate and shrink. Laila loved running her finger over Aziza's pleasing, soft skin, over the dimpled knuckles, the folds of fat at her elbows. Sometimes she lay Aziza down on her chest and whispered into the soft crown of her head things about Tariq, the father who would always be a stranger to Aziza, whose face Aziza would never know. Laila told her of his aptitude for solving riddles, his trickery and mischief, his easy laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人世间有很多快乐的事情，莱拉最为喜欢的是躺在阿兹莎身旁，脸贴着她女儿的脸，看着她两个大瞳孔扩散和收缩。莱拉喜欢用指头抚摸阿兹莎那令人愉悦的柔软皮肤、那肉乎乎的指节和手肘。有时候，她让阿兹莎躺在她的胸膛上，对着她那柔软的小脑袋低声说起塔里克，这个将会和阿兹莎永成陌路、素昧平生的父亲。莱拉告诉她，他擅长解谜，喜欢恶作剧，非常淘气，动不动就哈哈大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He held her eyes for an excruciatingly long time in an unblinking way that made her knuckles go pale around the milk bottle, and it took all that Laila could muster to not falter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他眼睛一眨不眨，盯着她看了好久；莱拉觉得真难熬，她使劲握紧奶瓶，握得指节都变白了，只有这样，她才能鼓起勇气，让自己别发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shuddered at what he would do if he found out that she had been stealing from him. Every week, since Aziza's birth, she pried his wallet open when he was asleep or in the outhouse and took a single bill. Some weeks, if the wallet was light, she took only a five-afghani bill, or nothing at all, for fear that he would notice. When the wallet was plump, she helped herself to a ten or a twenty, once even risking two twenties. She hid the money in a pouch she'd sewn in the lining of her checkered winter coat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一直在偷他的钱，她害怕要是被他发现会有什么样的下场。自从阿兹莎诞生之后，趁他睡觉或者上厕所，莱拉会偷偷打开他的钱包，拿走一张阿富汗尼钞票，每个星期一次。有时候，如果钱包里面没多少钱，她就只拿一张五元的纸币，或者一分钱也不拿，因为担心他会发觉。如果钱包满满的，她会取走一张十元或者一张二十元的钞票，有一次她甚至还冒险拿了两张二十元。她在她那件格子冬大衣的衬里缝了一个暗袋，把钱都藏在里面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wondered what he would do if he knew that she was planning to run away next spring. Next summer at the latest. Laila hoped to have a thousand afghanis or more stowed away, half of which would go to the bus fare from Kabul to Peshawar. She would pawn her wedding ring when the time drew close, as well as the other jewelry that Rasheed had given her the year before when she was still the malika of his palace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是得知自己打算明年开春——最晚到明年夏天——就逃跑，他会采取什么样的行动呢，莱拉心想。莱拉希望到时能存起来一千阿富汗尼左右，其中一半将会用来支付从喀布尔到白沙瓦的车费。前一年她还是拉希德的宫殿中的皇后，他给她买了一些珠宝。等到时间差不多了，她会把这些珠宝和结婚戒指一起拿去当铺换钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anyway," he said at last, fingers drumming his belly, "I can't be blamed. I am a husband. These are the things a husband wonders. But he's lucky he died the way he did. Because if he was here now, if I got my hands on him…" He sucked through his teeth and shook his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“反正，”他终于说话了，手指敲着他的腹部，“你可不能怪我。我是一个丈夫。这些都是丈夫想知道的事情。他那样死掉算走运的了。因为如果他还在这里，如果我来对付他……”他恶狠狠地吸进一口气，摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is a rumor," Rasheed said over dinner that night, smacking his lips, taking no notice of Aziza or the pajamas Laila had put on her, "that Dostum is going to change sides and join Hekmatyar. Massoud will have his hands full then, fighting those two. And we mustn't forget the Hazaras." He took a pinch of the pickled eggplant Mariam had made that summer. "Let's hope it's just that, a rumor. Because if that happens, this war," he waved one greasy hand, "will seem like a Friday picnic at Paghman."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天吃晚饭的时候，拉希德一眼都不看阿兹莎，更没有注意到莱拉给她穿上了睡衣。他一边舔着嘴唇，一边说：“有人说杜斯塔姆准备反水，加入古勒卜丁的阵营。到时马苏德就忙不过来了，要应付两边呢。我们必须不能忘记哈扎拉人。”他咬了一口玛丽雅姆在那个夏天腌制的茄子。“让我们祈祷这件事只是人们的谣传而已。因为如果真的发生了，这场战争，”他挥起一只油腻的手，“将会像帕格曼的星期五野炊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">TWO DAYS LATER, Laila woke up in the morning and found a stack of baby clothes, neatly folded, outside her bedroom door. There was a twirl dress with little pink fishes sewn around the bodice, a blue floral wool dress with matching socks and mittens, yellow pajamas with carrot-colored polka dots, and green cotton pants with a dotted ruffle on the cuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天后的早晨，莱拉醒过来，发现她的卧室门口有一堆婴儿的衣服，叠得整整齐齐。那儿有一条连衣裙，胸口处绣着一些粉红色的小鱼；一条蓝色的印花羊毛裙子，还有相称的袜子和手套；几件黄色的睡衣，上面布满了胡萝卜色的圆点；还有几条绿色的棉布裤子，裤管下面缀着带圆点的花边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila slipped out of the bedroom and found Mariam in the kitchen squatting, cleaning a pair of trout. A pot of rice was already soaking beside her. The kitchen smelled like cumin and smoke, browned onions and fish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉悄悄下了床，在厨房找到玛丽雅姆，她蹲在地上，正在宰杀两条鲑鱼。一锅大米已经泡上了。厨房里弥漫着孜然、炊烟、浸过黄油的洋葱和鲑鱼的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, he mounted her and relieved himself with wordless haste, fully dressed save for his tumban, not removed but pulled down to the ankles. When the frantic rocking was over, he rolled off her and was asleep in minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam took no notice of her. She finished cutting up the first trout and picked up the second. With a serrated knife, she clipped the fins, then turned the fish over, its underbelly facing her, and sliced it expertly from the tail to the gills. Laila watched her put her thumb into its mouth, just over the lower jaw, push it in, and, in one downward stroke, remove the gills and the entrails.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆没有看她。第一条鱼已经杀好了，她拿起第二条。她用一把锯齿状的刀把鱼鳍砍掉，然后把鱼翻过来，鱼腹对着她，熟练地从鱼尾到鱼鳃划了一刀。莱拉看着她把大拇指塞进鱼嘴，按住它的下颚，把刀插进去，朝下一划，把鱼鳃和内脏都清了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I had no use for them," Mariam muttered. She dropped the fish on a newspaper smudged with slimy, gray juice and sliced off its head. "It was either your daughter or the moths."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我留着它们也没用，”玛丽雅姆咕哝着说。她把鱼扔在一张沾满灰色汁液的、黏糊糊的报纸上，然后切掉它的头。“不给你的女儿，它们也会被蛀虫吃掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila examined Mariam's drooping cheeks, the eyelids that sagged in tired folds, the deep lines that framed her mouth -- she saw these things as though she too were looking at someone for the first time.

And when Aziza woke up crying and Rasheed yelled for Laila to come up and shut her up, a look passed between Laila and Mariam. An unguarded, knowing look.
