<div class="line_en">Angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her company while they were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day, in circumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them. During the preceding week, therefore, he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town, and they started together.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern. It was Christmas Eve, with its loads of holly and mistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day. Tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们一生中，这是他们第一次一起出去买共同的东西。那天是圣诞节前夜，小镇用冬青和槲寄生装饰起来，因为过节，镇上涌满了从四面八方来的乡下人。苔丝挽着克莱尔的胳膊走在他们中间，脸上光彩照人，满面春色，引来许多艳羡的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clare's life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect to the world of his own class. For months he had never gone near a town, and, requiring no vehicle, had never kept one, hiring the dairyman's cob or gig if he rode or drove. They went in the gig that day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱尔在奶牛场的生活一直是一种隐士的生活，同他自己阶级的人毫无往来。好几个月来，他从来没有到附近的镇上去过，他不需要马车，也从来没有准备马车，如果要坐车出去，他就向奶牛场老板租一辆小马车，如果要骑马出去，就租一匹矮脚马。他们那天出去就是租的一辆双轮小马车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and Tess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door. The general sitting-room was full of guests, who were continually going in and out. As the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell full upon Tess's face. Two men came out and passed by her among the rest. One of them had stared her up and down in surprise, and she fancied be was a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many miles off that Trantridge folk were rarities here.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a word to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. Could he have had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as before. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her; that he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note? She glanced into his room, and could see nothing of it. It might be that he forgave her. But even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her.</div>

Then, lest the flesh should again be weak, she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her own. When they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it. At some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney-corner to be whitened, and the brick hearth reddened, and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty here. This renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a dull winter morning, threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment.</div>

<div class="line_en">This coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as a d'Urberville and a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky; hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized with worldly ways by a few months' travel and reading with him, he could take her on a visit to his parents, and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line. It was a pretty lover's dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess's lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world besides.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tess's friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony, even had any been asked; but as a fact nobody was invited from Marlott. As for Angel's family, he had written and duly informed them of the time, and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come. His brothers had not replied at all, seeming to be indignant with him; while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter, deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage, but making the best of the matter by saying that, though a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law they could have expected, their son had arrived at an age at which he might be supposed to be the best judge.</div>

She rose from breakfast before he had finished, and hastened upstairs. It had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare's den, or rather eyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment, regarding and pondering. She stooped to the threshold of the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement. The carpet reached close to the sill, and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him, which he obviously had never seen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">The church was a long way off, and they were obliged to drive, particularly as it was winter. A close carriage was ordered from a roadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old days of post-chaise travelling. It had stout wheel-spokes, and heavy felloes, a great curved bed, immense straps and springs, and a pole like a battering-ram. The postilion was a venerable 'boy' of sixty -- a martyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure in youth, counteracted by strong liquors -- who had stood at inn-doors doing nothing for the whole five-and-twenty years that had elapsed since he had no longer been required to ride professionally, as if expecting the old times to come back again. He had a permanent running wound on the outside of his right leg, originated by the constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage-poles during the many years that he had been in regular employ at the King's Arms, Casterbridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到教堂去有很长一段路要走，又是在冬天，所以他们决定驾车去。他们在路边的酒店里定了一辆轿式马车，这辆马车是从坐驿车旅行的时代保存到现在的。它的轮辐很结实，轮瓦很厚，带拱顶的大车厢，皮带和弹簧粗大，车辕就像攻打城市的大木头。赶车的是一个六十岁的老“小子”，因为年轻时长年遭受风吹雨打，加上好喝烈性酒，所以受到风湿性痛风的折磨——自从不需要他再做专门的赶车夫以来，他无事可做，站在酒店的门口，已经整整二十五年了，仿佛是在期待旧日时光的重新到来。许多年来，他一直是卡斯特桥市王家酒店长期雇佣的车夫，他右腿的外面长期受到豪华马车车辕的摩擦，从而产生出一个长年不愈的伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this. Those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection. She was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further meditation. Her one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his, to call him her lord, her own -- then, if necessary, to die -- had at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway. In dressing, she moved about in a mental cloud of many-coloured idealities, which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们急急忙忙地换衣服，忙着动身，剩下的时间就只谈了这样几句话。她想了想，感到他说的话是为了让她放心。她对克莱尔一片忠心的强大浪潮，在后来关键的几个小时里推动着她前进，从而使她再也无法思考了。她只有一个愿望，这是她抗拒了这样长时间的一个愿望，那就是做他的人，称他为自己的主人，自己的丈夫——如有必要，就为他而死——这个愿望现在终于使她从疲惫不堪的思索之旅中摆脱出来了。在梳妆打扮的时候，她似乎漫步在五光十色的想象的精神云霞中，在云霞的照射下，一切不祥的可能性都慢慢消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
