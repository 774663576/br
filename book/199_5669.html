<div class="line_en">By the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys were already seated around the table. None of them looked up as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon's large red face was hidden behind the morning's Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利来到厨房的时候，德思礼一家三口已经围坐在桌旁了。哈利进门坐下，他们谁也没有抬头看他一眼。弗农姨父那张红红的大脸躲在早晨送来的《每日邮报》后面，佩妮姨妈正在把一只葡萄柚切成四份，她嘴唇噘着，包住了她长长的大马牙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto Dudley's plate with a tremulous "There you are, Diddy darling," Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year report.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达力阴沉着脸，显得气呼呼的，所占的空间似乎比平常更大。这就很有意思了，因为他总是一个人把方桌的一面占得满满当当。佩妮姨妈把四分之一没有加糖的葡萄柚送进达力的盘子，用颤抖的声音说了句：“吃吧，小乖乖。”达力怒气冲冲地瞪着她。自从达力暑假回家，带回来期末成绩报告单之后，他的生活便发生了十分痛苦的变化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn't understand him, while Uncle Vernon maintained that "he didn't want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway." They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report -- "He's a boisterous little boy, but he wouldn't hurt a fly!" Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于达力糟糕的学习成绩，弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈就像往常一样找到了一些借口：佩妮姨妈总是一再强调，达力是一个很有天赋的孩子，只是老师们都不理解他；弗农姨父则坚持说，他“可不希望自己的儿子变成一个娘娘腔的书呆子”。对于老师批评达力欺负同学的评语，他们也轻飘飘地一带而过——“他是一个活泼爱动的小孩，可是他连一只苍蝇都不忍心伤害的！”佩妮姨妈噙着泪花说。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">However, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-chosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters didn't stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia's eyes -- so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors -- simply refused to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，在报告单下面，有学校护士小心翼翼写下的几句话，就连弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈都无法找借口遮掩过去。尽管佩妮姨妈哭喊着达力只是骨头架子大，说他体重过沉只是一种青春期的暂时肥胖，并说他正处在发育成长的阶段，需要丰富的食物和营养，但有一个事实是无法改变的：学校服装库里再也找不到他能穿得下的裤子了。佩妮姨妈的眼睛，在察看一尘不染的墙壁上的手指印，或观察邻居们的私事时总是非常敏锐的，却不肯看到学校护士发现的一个事实：达力根本不需要额外补充营养，他的块头和体重已经接近一头幼年的鲸鱼了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So -- after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry's bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia -- the new regime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been emptied of all Dudley's favorite things -- fizzy drinks and cakes, chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called "rabbit food." To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller than Dudley's. Aunt Petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up Dudley's morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get more to eat than Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，在没完没了地发脾气之后，在惊天动地的争吵几乎把哈利卧室的地板掀翻之后，在佩妮姨妈抛洒了无数眼泪之后，新的饮食制度开始实施了。斯梅廷学校护士寄来的减肥食谱被贴在了冰箱上，凡是达力喜欢的食物——汽水饮料、蛋糕、巧克力糖和汉堡牛排，那上面一概没有，食谱上只有水果、蔬菜，还有一些弗农姨父称之为“垃圾食品”的东西。为了使达力情绪好一点儿，佩妮姨妈坚持要全家人都遵循那个食谱。此刻，她把四分之一的葡萄柚递给了哈利。哈利注意到，他这一份比达力的那一份要小得多。佩妮姨妈似乎认为，使达力振奋精神的最好办法就是保证他至少比哈利吃的东西多。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">But Aunt Petunia didn't know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following the diet at all. The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione's house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione's parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry hadn't touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid's cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from the journey. And then on Harry's birthday (which the Dursleys had completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，佩妮姨妈不知道楼上那块松动的地板下面藏着的秘密。她压根儿也想不到哈利根本就没有节食。当哈利听到风声，得知他们希望他整个夏天都靠胡萝卜棒过活时，便派海德薇给他的朋友们送信，呼吁援助，他们立刻积极响应。海德微从赫敏家里带回一个大盒子，里面塞满了无糖的点心（赫敏的父母都是牙科医生）。海格是霍格沃茨学校的猎场看守，他热情地捎来满满一袋自己做的岩皮饼（哈利连碰都没碰，对于海格的烹调手艺，他早有领教）。韦斯莱夫人派出他们家的猫头鹰埃罗尔，给哈利送来了一块巨大的蛋糕和各种风味的夹肉馅饼。可怜的埃罗尔，上了年纪，体力不支，送完这些货之后，整整休息了五天才缓过劲儿来。后来，在哈利生日那天（德思礼一家连提都没提），他一共收到四份超级大蛋糕，分别是罗恩、赫敏、海格和小天狼星送给他的。到现在为止，还有两个蛋糕没有吃完。哈利期待着回到楼上享用一顿真正的早餐，便毫无怨言地吃着他那份葡萄柚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon's large purple face. The mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon's most fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to disappear to the Weasleys' for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley's letter again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"OUCH!" said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework.
