<div class="line_en">Picturing the face with big round glasses, he suddenly realized how happy he was with his student-mistress. All at once, the Cambodia venture struck him as meaningless, laughable. Why had he come? Only now did he know. He had come to find out once and for all that neither parades nor Sabina but rather the girl with the glasses was his real life, his only real life! He had come to find out that reality was more than a dream, much more than a dream!</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nearly dark when he went out into the streets. He kept thinking about Sabina, feeling her eyes on him. Whenever he felt her long stare, he began to doubt himself: he had never known quite what Sabina thought. It made him uncomfortable now as well. Could she be mocking him? Did she consider the cult he made of her silly? Could she be trying to tell him it was time for him to grow up and devote himself fully to the mistress she herself had sent to him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜幕降临，弗兰茨出了门。他一直想着萨比娜，感到她投在自己身上的目光。在这种目光的注视下，他开始怀疑起自己，因为他不知道萨比娜真正的想法是什么。这一次，这种目光使他陷入混乱之中。她不是在嘲笑他吧？她是不是觉得他对她的崇拜很愚蠢？她是不是想对他说，他也该像个大人一样行事了，既然她把自己的女友亲手交给了他，他该一心一意好好待她才是？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bus stopped in front of the Bangkok hotel. No one any longer felt like holding meetings. People drifted off in groups to sightsee; some set off for temples, others for brothels. Franz's friend from the Sorbonne suggested they spend the evening together, but he preferred to be alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车在曼谷的一家旅店前停了下来。没人再想组织召开什么会议，大家各自散成一伙伙，在这座城市里到处逛，有的去参观庙宇，有的去逛妓寨。索邦大学的那位朋友建议弗兰茨晚上跟他一起过，但弗兰茨更愿意一个人呆着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that point, the girl with the glasses vanished from his thoughts and Sabina fixed her eyes on him, unreal Sabina with her grand fate, Sabina who had made him feel so small. Her wrathful eyes bored into him, angry and dissatisfied: Had he been had once again? Had someone else abused his idiotic goodness?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，戴眼镜的女孩子从他的意识范围消失了。萨比娜重又盯着他。那个命运伟大、而又不真实的萨比娜，那个使自己在她面前感到无比渺小的萨比娜。她的目光落在他身上，带着愤怒，也表示着不满：他还要被欺骗一次吗？又有人想再次利用他的善心吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tore his arm away from the man, who was now holding on to his sleeve. He remembered that Sabina had always admired his strength. He seized the arm one of the other men was lifting against him, and, tightening his grip, tossed him over his shoulder in a perfect judo flip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他猛地甩开那个紧抓着自己袖子的人的手，抽出身来。他知道，萨比娜一直欣赏他的力量。他一把抓住第二个家伙向他挥来的胳膊。他紧紧攥住这条胳膊，用一个完美的柔道动作，将那人从自己头顶上摔了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly there were two other men next to the first, and one of them asked him in English for his money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，在那个咕哝的人身旁，又出现了两个家伙，其中一个操着英语，令他把钱交给他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was he trying to say? He seemed to be inviting him somewhere. The man took him by the hand and started leading him away. Franz decided that someone needed his help. Maybe there was some sense in his coming all that distance. Wasn't he being called to help somebody?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在跟他说什么？他想这人是在请求他跟他走。那人一把拽着他的手，拖他走。弗兰茨心里想，准是有人需要他的帮助。他来到这里，也许是不为什么？可也许是被叫到这里救助某人的？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly a figure emerged out of the semi-darkness and said something to him in a language he did not know. He gave the intruder a look that was startled but sympathetic. The man bowed and smiled and muttered something with great urgency.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，从暗处闪出一条身影，用一种陌生的语言冲他说了几个字。弗兰茨看着眼前的来人，目光中既有惊讶之色，也夹杂着同情。陌生人躬下身来，微笑着，不停地用一种很坚决的语气咕哝着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He felt what was almost a cheerful hatred for these men. They had thought to have a good laugh at him and his naivete! He stood there with his shoulders slightly hunched and his eyes darting back and forth between the two remaining men. Suddenly, he felt a heavy blow on his head, and he crumpled immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看着这几个想玩耍他的天真的人，他感到一种快意的仇视。他立在那里，稍稍弓着腰，目光紧紧地盯着这几个家伙。可突然，一个重重的东西砸在他的头上，他旋即瘫倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He vaguely sensed being carried somewhere. Then he was thrown into emptiness and felt himself falling. A violent crack, and he lost consciousness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he was satisfied with himself. Sabina's eyes were still on him. She would never see him humiliate himself again! She would never see him retreat! Franz was through with being soft and sentimental!</div>

<div class="line_en">He woke up in a hospital in Geneva. Marie-Claude was leaning over his bed. He wanted to tell her she had no right to be there. He wanted them to send immediately for the girl with the glasses. All his thoughts were with her. He wanted to shout that he couldn't stand having anyone but her at his side. But he realized with horror that he could not speak. He looked up at Marie-Claude with infinite hatred and tried to turn away from her. But he could not move his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了很久以后，他才苏醒过来，躺在日内瓦的一家医院里。玛丽—克洛德正俯身在他床头。他想告诉她，自己不要她呆在这里。他想找人立即通知那个戴眼镜的女大学生。他只想着她一个人，不想别人。他想大声呼喊，自己不想要别的人待在他床边。但是他惊恐地发觉自己不能说出话来。他怀着无穷的仇恨盯着玛丽—克洛德，想转过身面对着墙，不要见到她。可他的身子动弹不得。他试着至少转过头去。但连他的头也无法再动一动。于是，他闭上双眼，不要再看见她。">查看中文翻译</div>
