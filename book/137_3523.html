<div class="line_en">He belonged to one of those middle-class families which were called indifferently, in the impertinent language of the last century, the high bourgeoise or the petty nobility. This family had inherited from the brothers Paclet the fief of Tirechappe, which was dependent upon the Bishop of Paris, and whose twenty-one houses had been in the thirteenth century the object of so many suits before the official. As possessor of this fief, Claude Frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in Paris and its suburbs; and for a long time, his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the Hôtel de Tancarville, belonging to Master François Le Rez, and the college of Tours, in the records deposited at Saint Martin des Champs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Claude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession. He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low.

<div class="line_en">Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to dare alapas et capillos laniare, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of "The sixth trouble of the University." He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the cappettes from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti-colored of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, azurini coloris et bruni, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais. The first pupil whom the Abbé de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers. The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo. Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相反，他出入圣约翰·德·博维街的大小学堂倒是相当勤快的。瓦耳的圣彼得教堂的住持每次开始宣讲教会法典，总是发现有个神学生在他讲坛的对面，贴着圣方德尔惹席耳学校的一根柱子站着，那就是克洛德·弗罗洛：他携带着硬壳写字板，咬咬鹅毛笔，垫着磨损了的膝头书写，冬天，还得对着手指呵气。教会博士米勒·狄利埃先生看见每星期一早晨歇夫·圣德尼学校一开门，第一个气喘吁吁跑来听讲的就是克洛德·弗罗洛。因此，这个小神学生虽然才十六岁，要是比一比，在神秘神学方面赶得上教堂的神父，在经文神学方面不亚于教议会的神父，在经院神学方面不逊于索尔朋的博士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals. From the "Master of Sentences," he had passed to the "Capitularies of Charlemagne;" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.; then the Epistle of Superspecula, of Honorius III. He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and tumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife with each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages, -- a period which Bishop Theodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="神学阶段既毕，他就匆匆忙忙学习教令。从《箴言大全》，他一头扎进了《查理曼法令汇编》。他以旺盛的求知欲，一部又一部教令，先后把伊斯巴耳的主教岱奥多尔的教令，窝姆的主教布夏尔的教令，夏特尔的主教伊夫的教令全都吞了下去；随后又啃下了继承查理曼法令的格腊田法令，然后是葛利哥里九世教令集，然后又是奥诺里乌斯三世的Super specula（17）书信。岱奥多尔主教于六一八年开始、葛利哥里教皇于一二二七年结束的那个时代，是民法和教会法在中世纪混乱中斗争发展的广泛动荡的时代，他都统统搞清楚了，弄熟悉了。【注：（17）拉丁文，论冥想。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Decretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts. He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses. Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon. He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts. He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented. His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science. At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把教令吃透了以后，他就刻苦钻研医学和自由技艺（18）。他研究了草药学、膏药学。他成了发烧、挫伤、骨折、脓肿方面的专家。雅各·岱斯帕尔要是在世，一定会承认他为内科大夫，里夏·艾伦会承认他为外科大夫。文学学士、硕士、博士学位他也都一一获得。他还研究了拉丁语、希腊语、希伯来语，这三重圣殿当时很少有人涉足。他在科学方面求知聚宝，真是如醉似狂一般。到了十八岁，他的四大智能（19）都经受住了考验。在这个青年看来，人生的唯一目的就是：求知。【注：（18）自由技艺，指语法、伦理、修辞、算术、几何、音乐、天文七学科。（19）中世纪和以后相当时间内，西方的人们认为，推理、判断、记忆和想象是人的四大智能。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence. Orphaned, the eldest, head of the family at the age of nineteen, he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world. Then, moved with pity, he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child, his brother; a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him, who had hitherto loved his books alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, "Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant." The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady. It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief. The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion. When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day. A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle. This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood. Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.</div>

<div class="line_en">This young brother, without mother or father, this little child which had fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms, made a new man of him. He perceived that there was something else in the world besides the speculations of the Sorbonne, and the verses of Homer; that man needed affections; that life without tenderness and without love was only a set of dry, shrieking, and rending wheels. Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Little Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast; Claude gave him to a nurse. Besides the fief of Tirechappe, he had inherited from his father the fief of Moulin, which was a dependency of the square tower of Gentilly; it was a mill on a hill, near the château of Winchestre (Bicêtre). There was a miller's wife there who was nursing a fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the little Jehan to her in his own arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小约翰还在吃奶，就失去了妈妈。克洛德就请人奶他。除了蒂尔夏普采邑之外，他继承父业的还有磨坊采邑。那是附属于让提伊方塔寺院的。是一座小山岗上的磨坊，位于温歇斯特（比塞特）城堡附近。磨坊女主人自己奶着一个漂亮的孩子，而且离大学城不远。克洛德就亲自把小约翰送去给她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He threw himself, therefore, into the love for his little Jehan with the passion of a character already profound, ardent, concentrated; that poor frail creature, pretty, fair-haired, rosy, and curly, -- that orphan with another orphan for his only support, touched him to the bottom of his heart; and grave thinker as he was, he set to meditating upon Jehan with an infinite compassion. He kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care. He was more than a brother to the child; he became a mother to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他倾其全部的爱去热爱他的小约翰，虽然他的热情已经够深刻、热烈、全神贯注的了。这可怜的柔弱的人儿，金发美少年，头发鬈曲，脸颊红喷喷的，这个孤儿除了另一个孤儿的爱之外别无依托，这就使得克洛德灵魂最深处都为之激动；既然他是一个性喜严肃思考的人，他就开始以无限的慈悲思虑着约翰的一切。他对弟弟关怀爱护无微不至，就好像小家伙是一件十分脆弱而又异常宝贵的物品。他对于这个小孩，不仅仅是长兄，而且成了他的慈母。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to bear, he took life very seriously. The thought of his little brother became not only his recreation, but the object of his studies. He resolved to consecrate himself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight of God, and never to have any other wife, any other child than the happiness and fortune of his brother. Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession. His merits, his learning, his quality of immediate vassal of the Bishop of Paris, threw the doors of the church wide open to him. At the age of twenty, by special dispensation of the Holy See, he was a priest, and served as the youngest of the chaplains of Notre-Dame the altar which is called, because of the late mass which is said there, altare pigrorum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从此，由于感到有了负担，他对于生活更加严肃。对小弟弟的考虑不仅成为他的娱乐，而且成为他学习的宗旨。他决心把自己整个身心奉献给他对上帝负责的那种前途，决心一辈子不要女人，不要孩子：他的妻子、他的孩子就是弟弟的幸福和前程。因此，他比以往更专心致志于教职使命。由于他才华出众、博学多识，而且身为巴黎主教的直接附庸（20），教会的大门是对他完全敞开着的。才二十岁，就由于教廷殊恩加被，当上了神父，作为圣母院最年轻的教士（21），侍奉着鉴于过晚举行弥撒而被称作altare pigrorum（22）的圣坛。【注：（20）这里是指其采邑隶属关系。（21）这里的“教士”，指主教坐堂教士。（22）拉丁文，“懒汉的圣坛”，也就是下文所说的“平民圣坛”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed, in very sooth. The poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye, his head placed directly on his shoulders, his spinal column was crooked, his breast bone prominent, and his legs bowed; but he appeared to be lively; and although it was impossible to say in what language he lisped, his cry indicated considerable force and health. Claude's compassion increased at the sight of this ugliness; and he made a vow in his heart to rear the child for the love of his brother, in order that, whatever might be the future faults of the little Jehan, he should have beside him that charity done for his sake. It was a sort of investment of good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother; it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for him, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that coin, the only sort which is received at the toll-bar of paradise.</div>
