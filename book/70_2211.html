<div class="line_en">In the midst of it all was Ella, a basket in one hand, a dreamy look on her face. Ever since her encounter with Kit, she had felt as though she were floating. She knew it was silly. Chances were she'd never see him again. But for that one moment, there in the woods, she had felt as though Kit had seen her for who she was, not as the girl of ashes her stepfamily had turned her into.</div>

<div class="line_en">The market was bustling. In several stands, grocers called out their wares, advertising the freshest vegetables, the plumpest fruits. A handsome florist held out a bouquet of bright daisies to a group of girls, causing them to giggle and avert their eyes. At the end of the market, away from the more pleasant smells, the fishmonger put out the day's catch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ella, too, looked toward the square and raised an eyebrow at the sight of the royal crier holding a large scroll. He stood on the edge of the town fountain, waiting for the people to gather. Curious, Ella moved closer and waited for his announcement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉也抬眼朝广场望去，看到王宫来的传令官手里拿着巨大的卷轴，瑞拉扬了扬眉毛。传令官站在城镇喷泉的边上，等着人们聚集起来。瑞拉也好奇地走过去，等着他宣布消息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearby, an old beggar woman lifted her head, listening to Ella with interest. She smiled and then turned at the sound of a loud commotion from the middle of the square. (Aha! I would remember this poor soul, gentle reader. For sometimes the people most overlooked are the ones who turn out to be most surprising… )</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离她们不远处，一位乞丐婆婆抬起头，饶有兴趣地听着瑞拉说话。她笑着，然后转过头看着人声嘈杂的广场中间。（啊哈！我记得这个可怜的人，亲爱的读者。因为有时候最不起眼的人往往是最让人吃惊的…）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was silence at the news. After all, what did a royal ball have to do with any of them? They were commoners. They did not dance or attend balls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人听了消息一片沉默。毕竟，宫廷舞会跟他们有什么关系呢？他们只是平民百姓。他们不跳舞，也不参加舞会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="传令官继续说道：“按照古老的传统，在这次舞会上，王子殿下将挑选他的新娘。”然后他威风凛凛地结束了公告。“此外，按照王子殿下的命令，王国里任何一位适婚少女，无论是贵族还是平民，都可参加舞会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉身边的人激动地议论起来，但是她没有说话。她甚至听到了自己的心剧烈跳动的声音。舞会？在王宫？她也可以参加？这就是说她有机会再见到基特！毕竟，他在王宫里做学徒！她高兴得咧嘴笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Three?" Ella repeated, surprised. She hadn't expected her stepmother to provide her with a dress. Collecting herself, Ella said, "That is… very thoughtful of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“三件？”瑞拉吃惊地问道。她没想到继母会给她也做一件礼服。瑞拉极力平静下来说：“您真是…太体贴了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine stood in the middle of the room, watching her daughters with a critical eye. "Calm yourselves," she finally said. "Listen to me." It took several moments, but finally Anastasia and Drisella focused. Satisfied she had their attention, Lady Tremaine went on. "One of you must win the heart of the prince. Do that, and we can unwind the debt in which we were ensnared when we came to this backwater." She turned and narrowed her eyes at Ella, who was standing quietly in the corner, lost in her own thoughts. "Having delivered your news, why are you still here? You must return to town right away and tell that seamstress to run us up three fine ball gowns."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人站在房间中央，用挑剔的眼光看着女儿们。“镇静，”最终她说道，“听我说。”好一会儿，安泰西亚和崔西里亚才注意听母亲的话。看到女儿们专心听着，特曼妮夫人才满意地继续说道：“你们其中一个必须赢得王子的心。那样的话，我们才能甩掉身上的债务，离开这个像一潭死水的地方。”她转过身，眯起眼睛看着静静地站在角落里想着自己心事的瑞拉。“消息送到了，你怎么还在这儿？赶紧去镇上告诉女裁缝赶制三件精美的舞会礼服。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other side of the room, Drisella let out a cruel laugh. "Mummy!" she cried. "She believes the other dress is for her!" The two sisters and their mother exchanged bemused expressions. "Poor, slow little Cinders. How embarrassing!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她听不懂这是什么意思，”安泰西亚脱口而出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella stifled a smile as she watched her stepmother and stepsisters gape at her. They had clearly not expected her to be able to speak French, much less so well. Recovering, Lady Tremaine clapped her hands. "Right. That's settled, then. Now go! Every bit of baggage in the kingdom will be tilting at the prince. You must get there first, before the seamstress is drowning in work." Without another word, she turned her back, dismissing Ella.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到继母和姐姐们目瞪口呆，瑞拉差点儿笑出来。显然她们没想到她会说法语，而且说得那么好。继母缓过神，拍着手说：“好。就这么办。赶紧去！整个王国的丫头都想要得到王子的心。你必须抢在前头，在女裁缝被活儿压垮之前赶到。”说完她转过身，让瑞拉离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ella left the drawing room. She knew she shouldn't have shown off like that, but it had felt nice to catch her stepfamily off guard. And the joke was on them, anyway, because she had never expected a dress; she knew what she could wear. Plus, she had no desire to become a princess. All she wanted was to see Kit and, with luck, have an evening during which she could be just a girl enjoying the company of a nice boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉离开了起居室。她知道自己刚才不该炫耀，但能让她们措手不及确实让她感到痛快。可笑的是她们自己，反正她也没指望要新衣服；她知道自己能穿什么。而且，她也没想要成为王妃。她想做的只是见到基特，还有如果幸运的话，可以在他的陪伴中度过一个美好的夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside a large palace room, the prince's regiment trained. The sound of clanging metal echoed through the large space. In the center of it all, Kit parried back and forth with the Captain of the Guard. While his movements were clean and precise, he was distracted. Noticing his pupil's lack of concentration, the Captain struck with his sword, rapping the prince sharply on his arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在王宫的一间大房子里，王子的侍卫们正在操练。偌大的地方到处回响着兵器碰撞的叮当声。士兵们中间，基特前后躲闪着侍卫长的攻击。他的动作干净利落，但有点心不在焉。看到王子没有集中注意力，侍卫长挥起剑，快速地敲击了一下他的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
