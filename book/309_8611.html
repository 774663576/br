<div class="line_en">It's also worthy of mention that every pattern has at least one small bias, and one day it will tip itself over, or fall from one page to another. In this case, the dominant factor was Rudy. Or at least, Rudy and a freshly fertilized sports field.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们穿过莫尔辛小镇往回走，一路上提出了各种方案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They argued on as they walked through town. On the outskirts, they witnessed the first of the farms and the trees standing like emaciated statues. The branches were gray and when they looked up at them, there was nothing but ragged limbs and empty sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一边吵嘴一边在小镇里游荡。来到郊外，他们看到了最近的几个农场，以及形如瘦弱的雕塑的果树。树枝干枯凄凉，除了枝杈和空荡荡的天空外便一无所有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So where the hell do we go?" Rudy asked.</div>

"It's pointless," Rudy said, "and I'm even hungrier now than I've ever been. I'm starving, for Christ's sake." He walked another dozen steps before he stopped and looked back. "What's with you?" because now Liesel was standing completely still, and a moment of realization was strapped to her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在慕尼黑大街上游荡了一个小时后，白日终于走到尽头，而他们已经快要放弃了。“一点用都没有，”鲁迪说道，“我越来越饿了。老天啊，我快饿死了。”他向前走了十几步，然后停下脚步回过头来。“你怎么回事？”原来莉泽尔站在原地不动了，她一脸恍然大悟的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”鲁迪越来越不耐烦，“小母猪，你是怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that very moment, Liesel was presented with a decision. Could she truly carry out what she was thinking? Could she really seek revenge on a person like this? Could she despise someone this much?</div>

<div class="line_en">She began walking in the opposite direction. When Rudy caught up, she slowed a little in the vain hope of achieving a little more clarity. After all, the guilt was already there. It was moist. The seed was already bursting into a dark-leafed flower. She weighed up whether she could really go through with this. At a crossroad, she stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她突然调头走向相反的方向。当鲁迪追上来时，她稍微放慢脚步，试图让自己想得更为透彻。毕竟，她已经有负罪感了。湿漉漉的土壤中，种子已经萌芽，开出一朵黑色的花。她掂量了一番，自己真的可以承受良心的谴责吗？在一个十字路口，她停下了脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Grande Strasse, they took in the splendor of the houses. The front doors glowed with polish, and the roof tiles sat like toupees, combed to perfection. The walls and windows were manicured and the chimneys almost breathed out smoke rings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来到格兰德街，两旁的景色尽收眼底。每座豪宅的前门都闪闪发亮，屋顶的瓦片像假发一样齐齐整整，墙面和窗户都修得很漂亮，烟囱里冒着烟圈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you mind?" She quickened even more and brushed aside Rudy's commentary. "We just have to wait for the right opportunity." Internally, she shrugged away from a kind of gladness that the window was closed. She berated herself. Why, Liesel? she asked. Why did you have to explode when they fired Mama? Why couldn't you just keep your big mouth shut? For all you know, the mayor's wife is now completely reformed after you yelled and screamed at her. Maybe she's straightened herself out, picked herself up. Maybe she'll never let herself shiver in that house again and the window will be shut forever… You stupid Saumensch!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“少跟我来这套，”她加快步伐，并不理会鲁迪的玩笑，“我们只不过要等待恰当的时机。”其实看到窗户紧闭时，她心里闪过一丝欣喜，但决定不予理睬。为什么，莉泽尔？她自问道。当他们炒了妈妈的鱿鱼时，你为什么要恶言相向？你为什么就不能闭上你那张大嘴巴？因为你心里很清楚，自从你对镇长太太大喊大叫之后，如今她已经彻底洗心革面。也许她已改过自新，重新振作起来。也许她再也不会在豪宅里瑟瑟发抖，而这扇窗户再也不会打开了…你这头愚蠢的小母猪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they angled toward it, Rudy asked just how in God's name they were going to get inside, but Liesel knew. "Local knowledge," she answered. "Local --" But when they were able to see the window to the library at the far end of the house, she was greeted with a shock. The window was closed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走向镇长的宅邸，鲁迪问到底有什么本事可以进去，但莉泽尔心里有数。“我自有办法。”她答道。可是，当他们来到房子的另一侧，找到书房的窗户时，莉泽尔着实吃了一惊。窗户关得严严实实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without complaint, Liesel undid the worn black laces and left the shoes on the ground. She rose up and Rudy gently opened the window just wide enough for Liesel to climb through. The noise of it passed overhead, like a low-flying plane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔没有出声反对，她解开破旧的黑鞋带，把鞋子脱在地上。她站起身，鲁迪轻轻打开窗户，宽度刚够莉泽尔爬进去。窗户打开时发出的声音像一架低空飞行的飞机从头顶呼啸而过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“吃的，”他提醒她，“去找吃的，有香烟也行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liesel, in the dusty dimness, shrugged off her feelings of nostalgia. She crept forward and allowed her eyes to adjust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灰尘飞扬、光线昏暗，莉泽尔把怀念的感触先丢到一旁。她向前挪动，好让眼睛适应房间里的光线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liesel heaved herself onto the ledge and tussled her way inside. Taking off her shoes, she realized, was a brilliant idea, as she landed much heavier on the wooden floor than she'd anticipated. The soles of her feet expanded in that painful way, rising to the inside edges of her socks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔爬到窗棂上，扭动身体钻进窗户。双脚落在木地板上发出的声响远超她的预想，她才承认脱掉鞋子确实是个好主意。她的脚底生生地撞到地板上，疼痛在袜子里蔓延开来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both items, however, were the last things on her mind. She was home, among the mayor's books of every color and description, with their silver and gold lettering. She could smell the pages. She could almost taste the words as they stacked up around her. Her feet took her to the right-hand wall. She knew the one she wanted -- the exact position -- but when she made it to The Whistler's usual place on the shelf, it was not there. A slight gap was in its place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是她的脑袋里完全装不进这两样东西。在镇长的书房里，她又一次置身书的海洋，它们五彩斑斓、内容各异，书脊上印着银色或金色的书名，她觉得自己到家了。她可以闻到纸张的油墨味。她几乎能品尝到那些堆砌在四周的文字的味道。她明白自己想要的是哪一本，知道它确切的位置，可是她来到通常放着《吹口哨的人》的那个书架前，它却不在那里。它的位置上只有一条窄窄的缝隙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's going on?" Rudy whispered sharply from outside, but she waved him a backhander that meant Halt's Maul. Keep quiet.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="等到他们跑过街角，拐进通往河流和慕尼黑大街的那条路时，莉泽尔停下来，弯着腰恢复体力。她垂下身子，空气仿佛在她的嘴里冻结了，心跳声在耳边怦怦响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“快走。”鲁迪警告她。但莉泽尔镇定地走到书桌前，拿起书，小心翼翼地出来。她先把头探出窗户，然后双脚落地，疼痛再次弥漫开来，这一次来自脚踝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你这个白痴！”他掴了自己一耳光，骂了一句。他羞愧地低下头，看到莉泽尔令人郁闷地只穿着袜子，很快做了决定，要弥补自己的过错。他诚恳地说了句“等我一会儿”，然后扭头跑向街角。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only when she walked back to the intersection of the two streets in her damp, dirty socks did she see him. Rudy's triumphant face was held nicely up as he trotted steadily toward her. His teeth were gnashed into a grin, and the shoes dangled from his hand.
