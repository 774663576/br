<div class="line_en">With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it -- like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in "the Captain's" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了刚才那人之外，还有两个人也在邮车旁艰难地行进。三个人都一直裹到颧骨和耳朵，都穿着长过膝盖的高统靴，彼此都无法根据对方的外表辨明他们的容貌。三个人都用尽多的障碍包裹住自己，不让同路人心灵的眼睛和肉体的眼睛看出自己的形迹。那时的旅客都很警惕，从不轻易对人推心置腹，因为路上的人谁都可能是强盗或者跟强盗有勾结。后者的出现是非常可能的，因为当时每一个邮车站，每一家麦酒店都可能有人“拿了老大的钱”，这些人从老板到最糟糕的马厩里的莫名其妙的人都有，这类花样非常可能出现。一千七百七十五年十一月底的那个星期五晚上，多佛邮车的押车卫士心里就是这么想的。那时他正随着隆隆响着的邮车往射手山上爬。他站在邮件车厢后面自己的专用踏板上，跺着脚，眼睛不时瞧着面前的武器箱，手也搁在那箱上。箱里有一把子弹上膛的大口径短抢，下面是六或八支上好子弹的马枪，底层还有一把短剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四面的山洼雾气氤氲，凄凉地往山顶涌动，仿佛是个邪恶的精灵，在寻找歇脚之地，却没有找到。那雾粘乎乎的，冰寒彻骨，缓缓地在空中波浪式地翻滚，一浪一浪，清晰可见，然后宛如污浊的海涛，彼此渗诱，融合成了一片。雾很浓，车灯只照得见翻卷的雾和几码之内的路，此外什么也照不出。劳作着的马匹发出的臭气也蒸腾进雾里，仿佛所有的雾都是从它们身上散发出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.</div>

<div class="line_en">The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那认真的头马到做出个动作表示坚决反对，就被一鞭子抽了回去，只好苦挨苦挣着往上拉，另外三匹马也跟着学样。多佛邮车再度向上挣扎。旅客的长统靴在邮车旁踩着烂泥叭卿叭哪地响。刚才邮车停下时他们也停下了，他们总跟它形影不离。如果三人之中有人胆大包天敢向另一个人建议往前赶几步走进雾气和黑暗中去，他就大有可能立即被人当作强盗枪杀。">查看中文翻译</div>

The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation.

<div class="line_en">The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.</div>
