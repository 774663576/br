<div class="line_en">Gentlemen of the jury! I cannot swear that certain motions pertaining to the business in hand -- if I may coin an expression -- had not drifted across my mind before. My mind had not retained them in any logical form or in any relation to definitely recollected occasions; but I cannot swear -- let me repeat -- that I had not toyed with them (to rig up yet another expression), in my dimness of thought, in my darkness of passion. There may have been times -- there must have been times, if I know my Humbert -- when I had brought up for detached inspection the idea of marrying a mature widow (say, Charlotte Haze) with not one relative left in the wide gray world, merely in order to have my way with her child (Lo, Lola, Lolita). I am even prepared to tell my tormentors that perhaps once or twice I had cast an appraiser's cold eye at Charlotte's coral lips and bronze hair and dangerously low neckline, and had vaguely tried to fit her into a plausible daydream. This I confess under torture. Imaginary torture, perhaps, but all the more horrible. I wish I might digress and tell you more of the pavor nocturnus that would rack me at night hideously after a chance term had struck me in the random readings of my boyhood, such as peine forte et dure (what a Genius of Pain must have invented that!) or the dreadful, mysterious, insidious words "trauma," "traumatic event," and "transom." But my tale is sufficiently incondite already.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while I destroyed the letter and went to my room, and ruminated, and rumpled my hair, and modeled my purple robe, and moaned through clenched teeth and suddenly -- Suddenly, gentlemen of the jury, I felt a Dostoevskian grin dawning (through the very grimace that twisted my lips) like a distant and terrible sun. I imagined (under conditions of new and perfect visibility) all the casual caresses her mother's husband would be able to lavish on his Lolita. I would hold her against me three times a day, every day. All my troubles would be expelled, I would be a healthy man. "To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee and print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss…" Well-read Humbert!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿我销毁了信，回到我的房间，反复沉思，弄乱头发，理好我紫色睡袍，咬紧牙齿低声呻吟着，而后突然间——突然地，法庭的先生，我感到一种陀思要耶夫斯基式的露齿大笑出现了（就通过我那扭曲狰狞的嘴唇），象遥远而可怖的太阳。我想象出了（在新的和准确的能见度下）她母亲的丈夫对他的洛丽塔所有滥施的抚抱。我可以一天三次把她搂在胸前。我的烦恼会尽消，我会成为一个健康之人。“拥抱你轻轻地在一只温柔的膝上，印在你娇软的颊上一个父亲的吻……”博学的亨伯特！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, with all possible caution, on mental tiptoe so to speak, I conjured up Charlotte as a possible mate. By God, I could make myself bring her that economically halved grapefruit, that sugarless breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而后，带着极端的谨慎，这么说吧，是小心翼翼地用咒语召来夏洛特当作可能的终身伴侣。靠着上帝，我能够强迫自己节省地分给她半个柚子，端给她无糖的早点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Humbert Humbert sweating in the fierce white light, and howled at, and trodden upon by sweating policemen, is now ready to make a further "statement" (quel mot!) as he turns his conscience inside out and rips off its innermost lining. I did not plan to marry poor Charlotte in order to eliminate her in some vulgar, gruesome and dangerous manner such as killing her by placing five bichloride-of-mercury tablets in her preprandial sherry or anything like that; but a delicately allied, pharmacopoeial thought did tinkle in my sonorous and clouded brain. Why limit myself to the modest masked caress I had tried already? Other visions of venery presented themselves to me swaying and smiling. I saw myself administering a powerful sleeping potion to both mother and daughter so as to fondle the latter through the night with perfect impunity. The house was full of Charlotte's snore, while Lolita hardly breathed in her sleep, as still as a painted girl-child.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now take down the following important remark: the artist in me has been given the upper hand over the gentleman. It is with a great effort of will that in this memoir I have managed to tune my style to the tone of the journal that I kept when Mrs. Haze was to me but an obstacle. That journal of mine is no more; but I have considered it my artistic duty to preserve its intonations no matter how false and brutal they may seem to me now. Fortunately, my story has reached a point where I can cease insulting poor Charlotte for the sake of retrospective verisimilitude.</div>

<div class="line_en">So Humbert the Cubus schemed and dreamed -- and the red sun of desire and decision (the two things that create a live world) rose higher and higher, while upon a succession of balconies a succession of libertines, sparkling glass in hand, toasted the bliss of past and future nights. Then, figuratively speaking, I shattered the glass, and boldly imagined (for I was drunk on those visions by then and underrated the gentleness of my nature) how eventually I might blackmail -- no, that is too strong a word -- mauvemail big Haze into letting me consort with little Haze by gently threatening the poor doting Big Dove with desertion if she tried to bar me from playing with my legal stepdaughter. In a word, before such an Amazing Offer, before such a vastness and variety of vistas, I was as helpless as Adam at the preview of early oriental history, miraged in his apple orchard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wishing to spare poor Charlotte two or three hours of suspense on a winding road (and avoid, perhaps, a head-on collision that would shatter our different dreams), I made a thoughtful but abortive attempt to reach her at the camp by telephone. She had left half an hour before, and getting Lo instead, I told her -- trembling and brimming with my mastery over fate -- that I was going to marry her mother. I had to repeat it twice because something was preventing her from giving me her attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希望解除可怜的夏洛特在路上二或三小防的疑虑（并且避免，也许会有的，与正面来车的相撞，那会播粉碎我们各自的美梦），我思虑再三，想通过电话在营地找到她，但这一企图失败了。半小时前她就已经离开，洛接了，我告诉她——声音颤栗，满是我对命运征服后的满足——我将娶她的母亲。我不得不重复两遍，因为不知是什么分散了她对我的注意力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gee, that's swell," she said laughing. "When is the wedding? Hold on a sec, the pup -- That pup here has got hold of my sock. Listen --" and she added she guessed she was going to have loads of fun… and I realized as I hung up that a couple of hours at that camp had been sufficient to blot out with new impressions the image of handsome Humbert Humbert from little Lolita's mind. But what did it matter now? I would get her back as soon as a decent amount of time after the wedding had elapsed. "The orange blossom would have scarcely withered on the grave," as a poet might have said. But I am no poet. I am only a very conscientious recorder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呀，很棒，”她说，笑起来。“婚礼是什么时候？等一会儿，小狗——这儿的小狗咬住了我的袜子，听着——”她又说她猜想她会有不少乐趣的……挂了电话后我发现，在营地的几小时那些新印象就足以把亨伯特·亨伯特的英俊形象从小洛丽塔的脑中涂抹掉。但现在这又有什么要紧？婚礼过后，适当的时间一到，我就可以把她领回来。“桔色的花苞会在墓地恐怖地枯萎，”一位诗人这样说。但我不是诗人。我只是一架十分坦白的记录器。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun made its usual round of the house as the afternoon ripened into evening. I had a drink. And another. And yet another. Gin and pineapple juice, my favorite mixture, always double my energy. I decided to busy myself with our unkempt lawn. Une petite attention. It was crowded with dandelions, and a cursed dog -- I loathe dogs -- had defiled the flat stones where a sundial had once stood. Most of the dandelions had changed from suns to moons. The gin and Lolita were dancing in me, and I almost fell over the folding chairs that I attempted to dislodge. Incarnadine zebras! There are some eructations that sound like cheers -- at least, mine did. An old fence at the back of the garden separated us from the neighbor's garbage receptacles and lilacs; but there was nothing between the front end of our lawn (where it sloped along one side of the house) and the street. Therefore I was able to watch (with the smirk of one about to perform a good action) for the return of Charlotte: that tooth should be extracted at once. As I lurched and lunged with the hand mower, bits of grass optically twittering in the low sun, I kept an eye on that section of suburban street. It curved in from under an archway of huge shade trees, then sped towards us down, down, quite sharply, past old Miss Opposite's ivied brick house and high-sloping lawn (much trimmer than ours) and disappeared behind our own front porch which I could not see from where I happily belched and labored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当下午就要成熟进入夜晚，太阳象往常一样圆圆地斜在屋角。我喝了一杯。又一杯。再一杯。杜松子酒和风梨酱，我的最好搭配，总能使我力量倍增。我决定为我们草坪的整洁忙一番。一个小提示。那儿长满了蒲公英，还有一条卷毛狗——我讨厌狗——已经把那些乎整的石头弄得脏兮兮，石头上曾放过一只日晷。大部分蒲公英已经从阳光变为月光。杜松子酒和洛丽塔都在我心中舞蹈，我差点被那张我想把它驱逐出去的折叠椅绊倒。血红色的斑马！有些打嗝听上去象是在发笑——至少我的就如此。花园后面一堵旧篱笆使我们与邻家的垃圾箱和紫丁香花照隔开；担门前的草评（它沿着我们房子的一侧斜过去）和公路之间，却无甚遮拦。因此我能眼望着（带着一个即将完成某项美好举动的人的假笑）夏洛特的归来：那颗牙齿应该立刻拔掉。我一边前后左右推动铲草机，凡是草叶仿佛都在低沉的太阳里摇动，一边还紧紧盯着公路的那边。公路从浓茂大树的弧形绿荫下弯进，然后朝我们伸过来，过来，非常笔直地，在老奥泊西特小姐爬满青藤的砖房和陡斜的草坪（比我们的整洁多了）前通过，然店消失在我们自己的前廊背后，从我快乐地喘息劳作的地方是看不见的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Louise had gone, I inspected the icebox, and finding it much too puritanic, walked to town and bought the richest foods available. I also bought some good liquor and two or three kinds of vitamins. I was pretty sure that with the aid of these stimulants and my natural resources, I would avert any embarrassment that my indifference might incur when called upon to display a strong and impatient flame. Again and again resourceful Humbert evoked Charlotte as seen in the raree-show of a manly imagination. She was well groomed and shapely, this I could say for her, and she was my Lolita's big sister -- this notion, perhaps, I could keep up if only I did not visualize too realistically her heavy hips, round knees, ripe bust, the coarse pink skin of her neck ("coarse" by comparison with silk and honey) and all the rest of that sorry and dull thing: a handsome woman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露易丝走后，我查看了冰箱，发现它太清贫了，就进城买了足足的食物。我也买了一些好酒和两三种维他命。我确信，靠这些刺激物和我的天然元气，一旦被召去表现强烈而焦灼的情欲时，我必能避免可能因冷漠而出现的任何窘迫。仿佛是从男性幻想的西洋镜中看到生机勃勃的亨伯特一遍又一起gJ得夏洛特颠倒魂神。她无比洁净、体态美好，我可以这样说，她就是我的洛丽塔的大姐姐——要是我没有太过意看见她沉重的臀部，浑圆的膝盖，隆满的胸房，她脖上粗糙的粉色皮肤（粗糙是相对于绸缎和蜜糖而言）以及所有其他令人遗憾和乏味的地方我可能一直会这样想着：一位美丽的妇人，那该多好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dandelions perished. A reek of sap mingled with the pineapple. Two little girls, Marion and Mabel, whose comings and goings I had mechanically followed of late (but who could replace my Lolita?) went toward the avenue (from which our Lawn Street cascaded), one pushing a bicycle, the other feeding from a paper bag, both talking at the top of their sunny voices. Leslie, old Miss Opposite's gardener and chauffeur, a very amiable and athletic Negro, grinned at me from afar and shouted, re-shouted, commented by gesture, that I was mighty energetic to-day. The fool dog of the prosperous junk dealer next door ran after a blue car -- not Charlotte's. The prettier of the two little girls (Mabel, I think), shorts, halter with little to halt, bright hair -- a nymphet, by Pan!-- ran back down the street crumpling her paper bag and was hidden from this Green Goat by the frontage of Mr. and Mrs. Humbert's residence. A station wagon popped out of the leafy shade of the avenue, dragging some of it on its roof before the shadows snapped, and swung by at an idiotic pace, the sweatshirted driver roof-holding with his left hand and the junkman's dog tearing alongside. There was a smiling pause -- and then, with a flutter in my breast, I witnessed the return of the Blue Sedan. I saw it glide downhill and disappear behind the corner of the house. I had a glimpse of her calm pale profile. It occurred to me that until she went upstairs she would not know whether I had gone or not. A minute later, with an expression of great anguish on her face, she looked down at me from the window of Lo's room. By sprinting upstairs, I managed to reach that room before she left it.</div>
