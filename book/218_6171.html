<div class="line_en">But if you have dreams of freedom -- of getting out of the rat race -- the first question to ask yourself is, "How do I respond to failure?" If failure inspires you to win, maybe you should go for it -- but only maybe. If failure makes you weak or causes you to throw temper tantrums -- like spoiled brats who call an attorney to file a lawsuit every time something does not go their way -- then play it safe. Keep your daytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, there is risk in those financial instruments also, even though they are safer.</div>

"What if the economy crashes right after I invest?" Or "What if I lose control and I can't pay the money back?" "What if things don't go as I planned?" Or we have friends or loved ones who will remind us of our shortcomings regardless of whether we ask. They often say, "What makes you think you can do that?" Or "If it's such a good idea, how come someone else hasn't done it?" Or "That will never work. You don't know what you're talking about." These words of doubt often get so loud that we fail to act. A horrible feeling builds in our stomach. Sometimes we can't sleep. We fail to move forward. So we stay with what is safe and opportunities pass us by. We watch life passing by as we sit immobilized with a cold knot in our body. We have all felt this at one time in our lives, some more than others.</div>

<div class="line_en">In another example, I hold a small portion of my assets in tax lien certificates instead of CDs. I earn 16 percent per year on my money, which certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers. The certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by state law, which is also better than most banks. The formula they're bought on makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look at them as 2 to 7-year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone, especially if they have money in CDs, that I hold my money this way, they will tell me it's risky. They tell me why I should not do it. When I ask them where they get their information, they say from a friend or an investment magazine. They've never done it, and they're telling someone who's doing it why they shouldn't. The lowest I yield I look for is 16 percent, but people who are filled with doubt are willing to accept 5 percent. Doubt is expensive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在另一个例子中，我通过持有一小部分拥有税收留置权的资产，来替代大额存单投资。 这使我的钱每年能挣到16％的利息，已经大大高于银行提供的5％的利率。这种权利受到房地产法和州法律的保证，且这种保证的可靠性强于大多数银行存款。事实证明这种投资的方式使资金十分安全，只是缺乏流动性，所以我把它们看作是2至10年期限的大额存单。然而几乎每次当我告诉某个人（特别是当他拥有大额存单投资时），我以这种方式持有资金，他们就会告诉我这样做太冒险。他们还会告诉我为什么我不应该那样做，但当我问他们从哪儿得到这些信息时，他们就会说是来自朋友那里或是投资杂志。他们从来没有这样投资过，但他们却老是劝这样做的人不要这样做，我所寻求的最低收益率为16％，可那些顾虑重重的人却愿意接受5％的投资收益率。怀疑的代价真的太高昂了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Chicken Little has taken over their brain and is yelling, "The sky is falling and toilets are breaking." So they avoid their "don't wants," but they pay a huge price. They may never get what they want in life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，每当我听到人们执迷于自己的“我不想要”而不悟，不去注意他们所想要的东西时，我就知道他们脑子里的“噪音” 一定很响。“小鸡”掌管了他们的思维，正在叫喊“天要塌下来了，厕所坏了”。于是，他们避开了自己的“不想要”，却为此付出了巨大的代价——他们可能将永远得不到自己在生活中想要的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little. "Just do what Colonel Sanders did." At the age of 66, he lost his business and began to live on his Social Security check. It wasn't enough. He went around, the country selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down 1,009 times before someone said "yes." And he went on to become a multimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting. "He was a brave and tenacious man," rich dad said of Harlan Sanders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="富爸爸教给我看待“小鸡”的一种方式，“要像桑德斯上校那样去做”。在桑德斯上校66岁的时候，他失去了所有的产业，开始靠社会保险金生活，而那点钱根本不够用，于是他走遍全国推销他的炸鸡方法。在他最终得到肯定回答之前，曾被拒绝1009次。然而通过不懈努力，他在大部分人打算放弃的年龄又开始了迈向百万富翁的道路。“他是一位勇敢、坚韧不拔的人”，富爸爸说的就是肯德基的创始人哈兰。桑德斯上校。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So when you're in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what Col. Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reason No. 3. Laziness. Busy people are often the most lazy. We have all heard stories of a businessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be a good provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the office and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home to an empty house. His wife has left with the kids. He knew he and his wife had problems, but rather than work to make the relationship strong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his performance at work slips and he loses his job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原因之三：懒惰。忙碌的人常常是最懒惰的人。我们听说过一位商人努力工作挣钱的故事，他努力工作希望为自己的妻子儿女提供更好的生活条件。他在办公室长时间地工作，在周末还把工作带回家去做。一天，他回到家，却发现人去楼空，他的妻子带着孩子离开了。他早就知道他和自己妻子之间有一些问题，可他却宁愿忙于工作，而不去改善双方的关系。可悲的是他在工作中的表现也滑坡了，最后他失去了这份工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
