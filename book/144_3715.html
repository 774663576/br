<div class="line_en">For the rest of the day he dreamed of their reunion. It was really a surprise to him, and thinking about it he knew that Athena would use her body to persuade him into the bargain. He lay on his bed imagining how it would be to be with her again. The image of her body was clear. Her white skin, the gentle curve of her belly, her breasts with their pink nipples, her eyes so green they were another kind of light, her warm delicate mouth, her breath, her flaming hair like the sun turning into smoky brass under a night sky. For a moment his old love swept over him, his love of her intelligence and her brave character that he had broken down into fear. Then for the first time since he was sixteen, he was fondling himself. His mind formed clear figures of Athena urging him on, until he climaxed. For that one moment he was happy and he loved her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一整天里，他都怔怔地想着他们重逢的场景。这的确出乎他的意料，想到这里他就知道，安提娜一定会用身体说服他接受交易的。他躺在床上，想象着再次跟她在一起会是什么样。她的身体无比清晰，白嫩的肌肤，小腹平缓的曲线，双乳和粉红色的乳头，她的眸子碧绿一片，仿佛一种别样的光芒，她温润精致的嘴唇，她的呼吸，她的金发，仿佛夜空里一轮云雾缭绕的旭日。恍惚间，旧日的爱意遍布他的全身；他爱她的聪慧和勇敢，是他把她的勇敢彻底变成了恐惧。于是，他从十六岁以来头一次爱抚起了自己的身体。在他的头脑里，安提娜的轮廓是那么清晰，她不停呼唤着他，直到他达到了高潮。在那一瞬间，他是幸福的，他爱过她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then everything turned around. He felt a sense of shame, of humiliation. He hated her again. Suddenly he was convinced it was some sort of trap. What did he really know about this guy Pollard, anyway. Skannet dressed hurriedly and studied the card Pollard had given him. The office was only a twenty-minute drive from the hotel. He rushed down to the hotel entrance and a valet brought his car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="平静下来，他感到了一种羞耻，一种侮辱。他再次痛恨起她来。突然他开始坚信，这是一个陷阱。关于这个叫波拉德的家伙，他了解些什么呢？斯堪尼特匆匆穿好衣服，端详着波拉德留给他的名片。办公楼的地址离酒店只有二十分钟距离。他冲下楼，跑出酒店大门，门童为他取来了车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he entered the Pacific Ocean Security Building, he was surprised at the size and opulence of the operation. He made his way to the reception desk and stated his business. An armed security guard escorted him to Pollard's office. Skannet noticed that the walls were decorated with awards from the L. A. Police Department, the Association to Help the Homeless, and other organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America. There was even some sort of a movie award.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走进太平洋安保的大楼时，这幢建筑的规模和富丽堂皇让他惊叹不已。他来到前台，说明了来意。一位武装警卫把他送到了波拉德的办公室。斯堪尼特注意到，墙上挂着许多奖状，有洛杉矶警察署发的、有无家可归者救助协会发的，包括美国童子军在内许多其他组织，甚至还有一个电影奖项。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="斯堪尼特确实很兴奋。他猜对了。安提娜果然打算用身体来换取交易。她这是准备要跟他过夜。血液涌上了他的脑袋，他脸上微红的皮肤几乎闪耀出了古铜色的光泽。他想起她年轻的时候，想起她还爱他的时候，想起了他也爱她的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," Pollard said agreeably. He picked up the phone. He didn't know what was going on and in his heart he hoped that Skannet would abort the meeting and he would no longer be involved in whatever Cross was planning to do.

<div class="line_cn" title="“行。”波拉德欣然说道，然后摘起电话。他不知道到底发生了什么。他在心里希望斯堪尼特取消这次会议，他就能从克罗斯的计划里抽身出来了。他还知道，安提娜不会直接跟他讲话的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dialed the number and asked for Athena. He put the loudspeaker on so that Skannet could hear the call.

<div class="line_en">It was a long drive, Skannet kept complaining and asking questions and even threatening to turn back. But Lia Vazzi was reassuring. Skannet had been told that the meeting place was a hunting lodge Athena owned in the Sierra Nevada, and the instructions were that they were to spend the night. Athena had insisted she wanted the meeting a secret from everyone, that she would settle the whole problem to everyone's satisfaction. Skannet didn't know what that meant. What could she do to dissolve the hatred that had grown over the last ten years? Was she stupid enough to think that a night of lovemaking and a bundle of cash would soften him? Did she think he was that simple? He had always admired her intelligence but maybe now she was just one of those arrogant Hollywood actresses who thought she could buy anything with her body and her money? And yet the thought of her beauty haunted him. Finally after all these years, she would smile at him, charm him, submit to him. No matter what happened he would have this coming night.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally the caravan halted. Vazzi directed exactly how Skannet's car should be parked. Then he had Skannet taken out of the van. Skannet made no resistance, he seemed to have accepted his fate. Well, he's finally figured it all out, Vazzi thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">Vazzi took the rope out of the car. He measured the length carefully and hung one end to the thick limb of a nearby tree. Two men were holding Skannet up straight so that he could slip the noose around the man's neck. Vazzi took out the two suicide notes that Leonard Sossa had forged and slipped them into Skannet's jacket pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">Six men were involved in this operation. They had blindfolded and gagged Skannet and put him in the van. Two of the men got into the van with him.

<div class="line_en">Two days later, alerted by an anonymous tip, the county sheriff found Skannet's body. He had to scare off an inquisitive brown bear who was hitting the rope to make the body sway back and forth, and when the coroner and his assistants arrived, they found the body's rotting skin eaten by insects.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took four of the men to lift Skannet to the roof of the van and then Lia Vazzi threw his fist out in the direction of the driver. The van shot ahead and Skannet flew off the roof and dangled in the air. The sound of his neck cracking resounded through the forest. Vazzi checked the corpse and removed the shackles from the body. The other men removed the blindfold and the gag. There were little scrapes around the mouth, but a couple of days hanging in the forest and they would not be significant. He checked the arms and legs for signs of restraint. Again, there were slight marks, but they would not be conclusive. He was satisfied. He did not know if it would work, but everything Cross ordered had been done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个人合力才把斯堪尼特举到小客车顶上。利亚·瓦齐朝司机一挥拳头，小客车一下子蹿了出去，斯堪尼特掉下车顶，在空中来回摇荡。他的脖子扭断的声音在树林中回响。瓦齐检查了一下尸体，解开了捆他的绳子，其他人去掉了他的眼罩和塞在嘴里的东西。嘴边有些小小的擦伤。但是在林子里挂个几天之后就没那么明显了。他检查了一下手腕和脚腕上捆绑的痕迹。虽然有些小痕迹，但是什么问题也说明不了。他很满意。他不知道这些安排会不会起作用，但是克罗斯吩咐的每件事情现在都完成了。">查看中文翻译</div>
