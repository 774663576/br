<div class="line_en">Or at least that was the idea. But in this instance, things didn't go quite as planned. When the technician pushed the tiny twin tubes into the device, there was a loud pop and blood splattered everywhere. One of the nanotainers had just exploded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alan Beam was sitting in his office reviewing lab reports when Elizabeth poked her head in and asked him to follow her. She wanted to show him something. They stepped outside the lab into an area of open office space where other employees had gathered. At her signal, a technician pricked a volunteer's finger, then applied a transparent plastic implement shaped like a miniature rocket to the blood oozing from it. This was the Theranos sample collection device. Its tip collected the blood and transferred it to two little engines at the rocket's base. The engines weren't really engines: they were nanotainers. To complete the transfer, you pushed the nanotainers into the belly of the plastic rocket like a plunger. The movement created a vacuum that sucked the blood into them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alan wasn't sure what to make of the scene. He'd only been working at Theranos for a few weeks and was still trying to get his bearings. He knew the nanotainer was part of the company's proprietary blood-testing system, but he'd never seen one in action before. He hoped this was just a small mishap that didn't portend bigger problems.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看着这一幕，艾伦不知该说什么好，他刚进Theranos几个星期，还在熟悉环境、寻找自己的定位。他知道纳米容器是这家公司独门检测系统的一部分，但他从未看过运作，他希望这次只是单纯不走运，而不是更大问题的前兆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alan had stayed in New York for medical school, enrolling at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine on Manhattan's Upper East Side, but he quickly realized that some aspects of being a doctor didn't suit his temperament. Put off by the crazy hours and the sights and smells of the hospital ward, he gravitated toward the more sedate specialty of laboratory science, which led to postdoctoral studies in virology and a residency in clinical pathology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦继续待在纽约念医学院，注册就读曼哈顿上东区的西奈山医学院（Mount Sinai School of Medicine），但他很快就了解到，医生这个职业有许多地方并不适合他的性情。疯狂的长工时以及医院病房的景象和气味，令他退避三舍，不慌不忙的实验室科学反而比较吸引他，于是博士后研究专攻病毒学，住院医师实习则到波士顿的布莱根妇女医院（Brigham and Women's Hospital），担任临床病理医师。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lanky pathologist's circuitous route to Silicon Valley had started in South Africa, where he grew up. After majoring in English at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg ("Wits" to South Africans), he'd moved to the United States to take premed classes at Columbia University in New York City. The choice was guided by his conservative Jewish parents, who considered only a few professions acceptable for their son: law, business, and medicine.</div>

<div class="line_en">After he applied for the job, Alan was asked to fly out for an interview scheduled for 6:00 p. m. on a Friday. The timing seemed odd but he was happy to oblige. He met with Sunny first and then with Elizabeth. There was something about Sunny that he found vaguely creepy, but that impression was more than offset by Elizabeth, who came off as very earnest in her determination to transform health care. Like most people who met her for the first time, Alan was taken aback by her deep voice. It was unlike anything he'd heard before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寄出应征信后，艾伦被要求飞过去面试，时间订在某周五下午六点，这个时间似乎有点奇怪，但他欣然接受。他先见了桑尼，然后才是伊莉莎白。他觉得桑尼有些地方令人心里发毛，但那个印象马上就被伊莉莎白抵销，她看起来是非常认真想要翻转医疗照护。跟大多数第一次见到伊莉莎白的人一样，艾伦也被她低沉的嗓音吓了一跳，他从未听过这种嗓音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although he received a job offer just a few days later, Alan wasn't able to start working at Theranos immediately. First, he had to apply for his California medical license. That took eight months, delaying his official start until April 2013. By then, it had been almost a year since his predecessor, Arnold Gelb, had quit. In between, a semiretired lab director named Spencer Hiraki had come in occasionally to review and sign off on lab reports. That hadn't seemed too problematic to Alan since the Theranos lab was only testing a few samples a week from Safeway's employee clinic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="短短几天后艾伦就被通知录取，但他还不能马上到Theranos工作，他得先取得加州的医师执照，这要花上八个月，他要到二〇一三年四月才能正式到任；到那时候，距离前任主管阿诺．盖普离职已将近一年，在这段空窗期，半退休的实验室主管：史宾赛．平木（Spencer Hiraki），会偶尔进来审核实验室报告。这在艾伦看来问题不大，因为Theranos实验室一周只检验几个来自喜互惠员工诊所的样本。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the summer of 2012, Alan was running the lab of a children's hospital in Pittsburgh when he noticed a job posting on LinkedIn that dovetailed perfectly with his budding fascination with Silicon Valley: laboratory director at a Palo Alto biotech firm. He had just finished reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs. The book, which he'd found hugely inspiring, had cemented his desire to move out to the San Francisco Bay Area.</div>

<div class="line_en">What did seem more troubling was the lab's morale when he took it over. Its members were downright despondent. During Alan's first week on the job, Sunny summarily fired one of the CLSs. The poor fellow was frog-marched out by security in front of everyone. Alan got the distinct impression it wasn't the first time something like that had happened. No wonder people's spirits were low, he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比较大的问题是，他接手的实验室士气低落，成员极度消沉。艾伦刚到任第一周时，桑尼突然就开除一名临床实验人员，那个可怜的同事在众目睽睽下被警卫架着押送出去，艾伦明显感觉这种事并不是第一次发生。难怪士气如此不振，他心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lab Alan inherited was divided into two parts: a room on the building's second floor that was filled with commercial diagnostic equipment, and a second room beneath it where research was being conducted. The upstairs room was the CLIA-certified part of the lab, the one Alan was responsible for. Sunny and Elizabeth viewed its conventional machines as dinosaurs that would soon be rendered extinct by Theranos's revolutionary technology, so they called it "Jurassic Park." They called the downstairs room "Normandy" in reference to the D-day landings during World War II. The proprietary Theranos devices it contained would take the lab industry by storm, like the Allied troops who braved hails of machine-gun fire on Normandy's beaches to liberate Europe from Nazi occupation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他接手的实验室分成两部分：一个位于二楼的房间，里面放满商用诊断仪器；另一个则位于一楼，就在二楼实验室正下方，是研究进行的地方。二楼实验室有经过CLIA认证合格，是艾伦负责的部分，桑尼和伊莉莎白把这个房间里的传统仪器视为恐龙，很快就会被Theranos革命性的技术给消灭，因而称之为「侏罗纪公园」；而把楼下实验室称为「诺曼第」，影射二次大战的诺曼第登陆，这个房间放的是Theranos独家设备，将如同秋风扫落叶般袭卷实验室产业，就像盟军在机关枪砲火中勇敢抢进诺曼第海滩，将欧洲从纳粹占领中解放。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his eagerness and excitement, Alan initially bought into the bravado. But a conversation he had with Paul Patel shortly after the botched nanotainer demonstration raised questions in his mind about how far along the Theranos technology really was. Patel was the biochemist who led the development of blood tests for Theranos's new device, which Alan knew only by its code name --"4S." Patel let slip that his team was still developing its assays on lab plates on the bench. That surprised Alan, who had assumed the assays were already integrated into the 4S. When he asked why that wasn't the case, Patel replied that the new Theranos box wasn't working.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为热切和兴奋，艾伦一开始对那股虚张声势的蛮勇信以为真，但是那次搞砸纳米容器的示范过后不久，他与保罗．帕特尔一席谈话后，心里开始怀疑Theranos的技术实际到底做到什么地步。帕特尔是生物化学家，负责带领Theranos新设备的检测研发（艾伦对新设备一无所知，只知道代号是4S），谈话中他说溜了嘴，提到他的团队还处于坐在实验室椅子上用器皿开发测定方式的阶段，艾伦听了大为惊讶，他一直以为测定方式已经集成进4S里面，当他进一步询问原因，帕特尔回答Theranos的新盒子还不能用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the summer of 2013, as ChiatDay scrambled to ready the Theranos website for the company's commercial launch, the 4S, aka the miniLab, had been under development for more than two and a half years. But the device remained very much a work in progress. The list of its problems was lengthy.</div>

<div class="line_en">The biggest problem of all was the dysfunctional corporate culture in which it was being developed. Elizabeth and Sunny regarded anyone who raised a concern or an objection as a cynic and a naysayer. Employees who persisted in doing so were usually marginalized or fired, while sycophants were promoted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中最大问题是失能的企业文化。桑尼和伊莉莎白把任何提出顾虑或反对的人，都视为愤世嫉俗或唱衰，坚持这么做的员工通常会被边缘化或开除，而阿谀逢迎的人则会获得升迁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny had elevated a group of ingratiating Indians to key positions. One of them was Sam Anekal, the manager in charge of integrating the various components of the miniLab who had clashed with Ian Gibbons. Another was Chinmay Pangarkar, a bioengineer with a Ph. D. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. There was also Suraj Saksena, a clinical chemist who had a Ph. D. in biochemistry and biophysics from Texas A&amp;M. On paper, all three had impressive educational credentials, but they shared two traits: they had very little industry experience, having joined the company not long after finishing their studies, and they had a habit of telling Elizabeth and Sunny what they wanted to hear, either out of fear or out of desire to advance, or both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑尼把一群迎合巴结他的印度人拔擢到重要位置，其中之一是撒门萨．阿内卡尔，负责集成迷你实验室各个组成组件的主管，他与伊恩．吉本斯不对盘；还有一个是生物工程师钦美．潘格卡（Chinmay Pangarkar），有加州大学圣塔芭芭拉分校化工博士学位；以及临床化学家苏拉吉．赛克斯纳（Suraj Saksena），他是德州农工大学（Texas A&amp;M）生物化学和生物物理博士。从书面数据来看，三人都有漂亮学历，但有两个共同点：三人都没有什么业界经验，毕业后没多久就加入Theranos；再者，他们习惯讲伊莉莎白和桑尼爱听的话，不是出于恐惧就是渴望升迁，或者两者皆有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the dozens of Indians Theranos employed, the fear of being fired was more than just the dread of losing a paycheck. Most were on H-1B visas and dependent on their continued employment at the company to remain in the country. With a despotic boss like Sunny holding their fates in his hands, it was akin to indentured servitude. Sunny, in fact, had the master-servant mentality common among an older generation of Indian businessmen. Employees were his minions. He expected them to be at his disposal at all hours of the day or night and on weekends. He checked the security logs every morning to see when they badged in and out. Every evening, around seven thirty, he made a fly-by of the engineering department to make sure people were still at their desks working.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于Theranos雇用的几十位印度人来说，被开除的恐惧绝不仅止于担心没有收入。他们大多拿H–1B签证（编按：从事专业技术类工作的签证类别），必须继续被这家公司聘用才能留在美国，命运交在桑尼这种专横老板手中，等同签下一纸奴隶契约。事实上，桑尼具有印度老一辈生意人常见的主仆心态，员工是他的奴才，他期待员工随时任他使唤，不管是白天、晚上还是周末。每天早上他会查看警卫纪录，看员工几点打卡上班，每天晚上七点半左右，他会快速巡一遍工程部门，确认大家还在位子上工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Elizabeth was fast to catch on to engineering concepts, Sunny was often out of his depth during engineering discussions. To hide it, he had a habit of repeating technical terms he heard others using. During a meeting with Arnav's team, he latched onto the term "end effector," which signifies the claws at the end of a robotic arm. Except Sunny didn't hear "end effector," he heard "endofactor." For the rest of the meeting, he kept referring to the fictional endofactors. At their next meeting with Sunny two weeks later, Arnav's team brought a PowerPoint presentation titled "Endofactors Update." As Arnav flashed it on a screen with a projector, the five members of his team stole furtive glances at one another, nervous that Sunny might become wise to the prank. But he didn't bat an eye and the meeting proceeded without incident. After he left the room, they burst out laughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不同于伊莉莎白很快就能掌握工程方面的概念，工程讨论往往超过桑尼的能力所及，为了掩饰这点，他有个习惯，喜欢把听来的术语现学现卖。有一次跟阿纳夫的团队开会时，他学到end effector（终端效应器）这个术语，那是指机器手臂末端的爪子，只是他把end effector错听成endofactor，接下来的会议中，他不断提到不存在的endofactor。两个星期后再次跟桑尼开会时，阿纳夫团队做了一个PowerPoint演示文稿，标题是「Endofactors Update」（终端效应器最新进展），阿纳夫一把标题投影到屏幕上，团队五个成员立刻偷偷互看一眼，很紧张桑尼会看穿这起恶作剧。但是桑尼的脸色没有异状，会议平安无事继续进行，直到他离开会议室，所有人才放声大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With time, some employees grew less afraid of him and devised ways to manage him, as it dawned on them that they were dealing with an erratic man-child of limited intellect and an even more limited attention span. Arnav Khannah, a young mechanical engineer who worked on the miniLab, figured out a surefire way to get Sunny off his back: answer his emails with a reply longer than five hundred words. That usually bought him several weeks of peace because Sunny simply didn't have the patience to read long emails. Another strategy was to convene a biweekly meeting of his team and invite Sunny to attend. He might come to the first few, but he would eventually lose interest or forget to show up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时间过去，有些员工愈来愈不怕他，还找到对付他的方法，因为他们渐渐明白他们面对的是一个喜怒无常、长不大的男人，智力有限，专注力更有限。阿纳夫．坎纳（Arnav Khannah）是迷你实验室团队的年轻机械工程师，他想出一个万无一失的方法，可以让桑尼不来找麻烦：回复桑尼的电邮时，写超过五百字。只要这么做，通常可以换得几个星期的清静，因为桑尼根本没有耐心阅读文本很多的信件。另一个方法是每两周开一次部门会议，邀请桑尼参加，前几次他可能会到，但最后一定会失去兴趣，不然就是忘了出席。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not all the setbacks encountered during the miniLab's development could be laid at Sunny's feet, however. Some were a consequence of Elizabeth's unreasonable demands. For instance, she insisted that the miniLab cartridges remain a certain size but kept wanting to add more assays to them. Arnav didn't see why the cartridges couldn't grow by half an inch since consumers wouldn't see them. After her run-in with Lieutenant Colonel David Shoemaker, Elizabeth had abandoned her plan of putting the Theranos devices in Walgreens stores and operating them remotely, to avoid problems with the FDA. Instead, blood pricked from patients' fingers would be couriered to Theranos's Palo Alto lab and tested there. But she remained stuck on the notion that the miniLab was a consumer device, like an iPhone or an iPad, and that its components needed to look small and pretty. She still nurtured the ambition of putting it in people's homes someday, as she had promised early investors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，迷你实验室研发过程所遭遇的挫败，不能全归咎于桑尼，有些是伊莉莎白不合理的要求所致。举个例子，她坚持迷你实验室的卡匣要维持某个尺寸不变，但又不断想加入更多测定，阿纳夫看不出为什么卡匣不能大个半吋，反正消费者又看不到。跟休梅克中校的冲突过后，为了回避FDA的问题，伊莉莎白已经放弃把Theranos设备放在沃尔格林门市远距使用的计划，改采将病患血液快递到其帕罗奥图实验室检测。尽管如此，她仍然坚持迷你实验室是跟iPhone或iPad一样的消费性设备，组成组件必须小而美。她依然怀抱同样的野心，有朝一日要让Theranos设备进入一般民众家里，一如她对早期投资人的承诺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arnav and his team also got Sunny to use the obscure engineering term "crazing." It normally refers to a phenomenon that produces fine cracks on the surface of a material, but Arnav and his colleagues used it liberally and out of context to see if they could get Sunny to repeat it, which he did. Sunny's knowledge of chemistry was no better. He thought the chemical symbol for potassium was P (it's K; P is the symbol for phosphorus)-- a mistake most high school chemistry students wouldn't make.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿纳夫也成功引诱桑尼使用晦涩的工程术语crazing（细裂痕），这个字通常是指某材料表面产生细微裂痕的现象，但是阿纳夫和同事用得很随兴而且掐头去尾，目的是引诱桑尼鹦鹉学舌，结果他还真的上钩。桑尼的化学知识也好不到哪里去，他以为钾的化学符号是P（K才对，P是磷的化学符号）——念过化学的高中生大多不会犯这种错误。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another difficulty stemmed from Elizabeth's insistence that the miniLab be capable of performing the four major classes of blood tests: immunoassays, general chemistry assays, hematology assays, and assays that relied on the amplification of DNA. The only known approach that would permit combining all of them in one desktop machine was to use robots wielding pipettes. But this approach had an inherent flaw: over time, a pipette's accuracy drifts. When the pipette is brand new, aspirating 5 microliters of blood might require the little motor that activates the pipette's pump to rotate by a certain amount. But three months later, that exact same rotation of the motor might yield only 4.4 microliters of blood -- a large enough difference to throw off the entire assay. While pipette drift was something that ailed all blood analyzers that relied on pipetting systems, the phenomenon was particularly pronounced on the miniLab. Its pipettes had to be recalibrated every two to three months, and the recalibration process put the device out of commission for five days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有个困难来自伊莉莎白另一个坚持：迷你实验室必须能够进行四种主要检测，包括免疫测定、普通化学测定、血液测定、仰赖DNA扩增的测定。若要把这四种测定集成在一台桌面型机器，已知的唯一方法是用机器人抓取吸量管，但这方法有个先天缺点：吸量管的精确度会随着时间而改变。如果是全新的吸量管，吸取五微升血液可能需要小马达（用来启动吸量管的帮浦）旋转某个程度，但三个月后，同样的马达旋转程度可能只能吸取四‧四微升的血液——这样的血量差距已经足以扔掉整个测定。虽然说，只要是仰赖吸量管的血液分析仪都会为吸管的变化所苦，但这种现象对迷你实验室尤其明显，每二、三个月就必须重新校准吸管，而校准时就有五天不能使用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Compared to big commercial blood analyzers, another one of the miniLab's glaring weaknesses was that it could process only one blood sample at a time. Commercial machines were bulky for a reason: they were designed to process hundreds of samples simultaneously. In industry jargon, this was known as having a "high throughput." If the Theranos wellness centers attracted a lot of patients, the miniLab's low throughput would result in long wait times and make a joke of the company's promise of fast test results.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟大型商用血液分析仪比起来，迷你实验室另一个很明显的缺点是：一次只能处理一份血液样本。商用仪器之所以体积庞大是有原因的，他们原本的设计就是一次处理上百个样本，用业界术语来说就是「高通量」（high throughput）。如果Theranos健康中心吸引很多患者上门，迷你实验室的低通量势必会造成长时间等待，Theranos所承诺的快速得知检验结果就成为笑话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kyle Logan, a young chemical engineer who'd joined Theranos right out of Stanford after earning an academic award there named after Channing Robertson, had frequent debates with Sam Anekal about this issue. He thought the company should migrate to a more reliable system that didn't involve pipettes, such as the one Abaxis used in its Piccolo Xpress analyzer. Sam would reply that the Piccolo could perform only one class of blood test, general chemistry assays. (Unlike immunoassays, which measure a substance in the blood by using antibodies that bind to the substance, general chemistry assays rely on other chemical principles such as light absorbance or electrical signal changes.) Elizabeth wanted a machine that was more versatile, he'd remind Kyle.</div>

<div class="line_en">In an attempt to remedy this problem, someone had come up with the idea of stacking six miniLabs one on top of the other and having them share one cytometer to reduce the size and cost of the resulting contraption. This Frankenstein machine was called the "six-blade," a term borrowed from the computer industry, where stacking servers on top of one another is common to save space and energy. In these modular stacking configurations, each server is referred to as a "blade."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了解决这个问题，有人想出把六台迷你实验室堆栈起来，共用一个血细胞计数器，以缩减这个奇怪设备的尺寸和成本。他们把这台有如科学怪人的机器称为「六刀锋」（six-blade），这个用语来自电脑产业（编按：来自刀片服务器［Blade Server］），为了节省空间和能源，把服务器一个一个叠起来是电脑界常见的方法，在这种模块堆栈的结构中，每一台服务器都被称为一个「刀锋」（blade）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But no one had stopped to consider what implications this design would have with respect to one key variable: temperature. Each miniLab blade generated heat, and heat rises. When the six blades were processing samples at the same time, the temperature in the top blades reached a level that interfered with their assays. Kyle, who was twenty-two and just out of college, couldn't believe something that basic had been overlooked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是却没有人停下来想想，这种设计可能会影响某个关键变量：温度。每个迷你实验室刀锋会产生热，而热会上升，如果六个刀锋同时处理样本，最上方的刀锋温度会达到足以干扰测定的程度。二十二岁、刚从大学毕业的凯尔，不敢相信这么基本的事实竟然完全被忽略。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aside from its cartridge, pipette, and temperature issues, many of the other technical snafus that plagued the miniLab could be chalked up to the fact that it remained at a very early prototype stage. Less than three years was not a lot of time to design and perfect a complex medical device. These problems ranged from the robots' arms landing in the wrong places, causing pipettes to break, to the spectrophotometers being badly misaligned. At one point, the blood-spinning centrifuge in one of the miniLabs blew up. These were all things that could be fixed, but it would take time. The company was still several years away from having a viable product that could be used on patients.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="撇开卡匣、吸量管、温度这三个问题，迷你实验室其他种种技术混乱可全部归因于一个事实：这是一台仍处于很初期原型机阶段的机器。以设计、完善一台复杂的医疗设备来说，三年不到的时间其实并不长。那些技术问题包括机器手臂落错位置而造成吸量管断裂、光谱仪歪斜得太厉害等，曾经有一次，一台迷你实验室里旋转血液的离心机还爆炸。这些问题都可以修正，但需要时间，Theranos还要好几年才可能做出真正可用于病人身上的产品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next few weeks, Alan observed Sam spend hours opening the machine up and filming its innards with his iPhone camera. He was hacking into it to try to make it compatible with small finger-stick blood samples, Alan realized. It seemed like confirmation of what Paul Patel had told him: the 4S must not be working, otherwise why resort to such desperate measures? Alan knew the Edison could only perform immunoassays, so it made sense that Daniel and Sam would choose the ADVIA, which specialized in general chemistry assays.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the panels of blood tests most commonly ordered by physicians was known as the "chem 18" panel. Its components, which ranged from tests to measure electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride to tests used to monitor patients' kidney and liver function, were all general chemistry assays. Launching in Walgreens stores with a menu of blood tests that didn't include these tests would have been pointless. They accounted for about two-thirds of doctors' orders.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the ADVIA was designed to handle a larger quantity of blood than you could obtain by pricking a finger. So Daniel and Sam thought up a series of steps to adapt the Siemens analyzer to smaller samples. Chief among these was the use of a big robotic liquid handler called the Tecan to dilute the little blood samples collected in the nanotainers with a saline solution. Another was to transfer the diluted blood into custom-designed cups half the size of the ones that normally went into the ADVIA.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，ADVIA所需的血液样本远比扎手指取得血液多很多，于是丹尼尔和山姆想出一连串步骤改装西门子那台分析仪，让它可以适用于小样本。其中首要步骤是，采用大型自动分注机器人Tecan，加入生理食盐水稀释纳米容器里的小样本；另一个步骤是，将稀释后的血液转移到订做的杯子里，杯子尺寸是ADVIA原有杯子的一半。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The combination of these two steps solved a problem known as "dead volume." Like many commercial analyzers, the ADVIA featured a probe that dropped down into the blood sample and aspirated it. Although it aspirated most of the sample, there was always some unused liquid left at the bottom. Reducing the sample cup's size brought its bottom closer to the probe's tip and diluting the blood created more liquid to work with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两个步骤合力解决了「残量」（dead volume）问题。跟许多商用分析仪一样，ADVIA也是用探针插入血液样本中吸取血液，虽然大部分血液都吸走了，但底部总会留下一些血液未用到，现在把承装样本的杯子尺寸缩小，可让杯子底部更靠近探针尖端，而稀释血液则制造出更多液体可供使用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moreover, this double dilution lowered the concentration of the analytes in the blood samples to levels that were below the ADVIA's FDA-sanctioned analytic measurement range. In other words, it meant using the machine in a way that neither the manufacturer nor its regulator approved of. To get the final patient result, one had to multiply the diluted result by the same factor the blood had been diluted by, not knowing whether the diluted result was even reliable. Daniel and Sam were nonetheless proud of what they'd accomplished. At heart, both were engineers for whom patient care was an abstract concept. If their tinkering turned out to have adverse consequences, they weren't the ones who would be held personally responsible. It was Alan's name, not theirs, that was on the CLIA certificate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更何况，经过两次稀释后，血液中所含的被测定物质浓度会降低，低于ADVIA被FDA核可的量测范围，换句话说，等于是用不符合制造商和主管机关核可的方式来使用这台机器。血液稀释后的检测结果必须乘上稀释倍数，才是最终检测结果，而稀释后的检测结果可不可信甚至还不知道。尽管如此，丹尼尔和山姆对他们所做的事仍然很自豪，这两人骨子里是工程师，对他们来说，照顾病患是个抽象概念，就算他们修改机器最后产生负面后果，需要负起责任的人也不是他们，而是艾伦，因为CLIA证书上的名字是艾伦，不是他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alan had reservations about the dilution part. The Siemens analyzer already diluted blood samples when it performed its assays. The protocol Daniel and Sam had come up with meant that the blood would be diluted twice, once before it went into the machine and a second time inside it. Any lab director worth his salt knew that the more you tampered with a blood sample, the more room you introduced for error.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦对稀释的部分持保留态度。那台西门子分析仪在运行测定时原本就会稀释样本，若采用丹尼尔和山姆想出的方法，代表血液会被稀释两次，一次是放进分析仪之前，一次是放进去之后。任何称职的实验室主管都知道，乱动血液样本的次数愈多，愈可能产生误差。">查看中文翻译</div>

Alan suspected the cause of the latter was a phenomenon known as "hemolysis," which occurs when red blood cells burst and release extra potassium into the sample. Hemolysis was a known side effect of finger-stick collection. Milking blood from a finger put stress on red blood cells and could cause them to break apart.</div>
