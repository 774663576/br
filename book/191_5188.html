<div class="line_en">"If you wish," said the Lion, "I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子说：“如果你愿意，我将跑到森林中去，为你杀一只鹿来。你可以用火烤煮它，因为你们的嗜好是这样的特别，喜欢吃煮熟了的食物，这样一烤，你们会有一顿很精美的早餐了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天夜里，他们不得不露宿在森林中的一株大树底下，因为附近没有一间屋子。那株大树长得很高很茂盛，在下露的夜里，保护了他们。铁皮人用他的斧头，斫下一大堆木柴，多萝茜燃起了一股美丽的火来，使她温暖着，并且不觉得寂寞。她和托托吃着最后剩下的面包，现在她不知道明天拿什么东西来当早餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天是旅行者们多事的日子。他们辛苦地走了一个钟头，看见前面有一条极大的壕沟，横在道路上，并且把森林划分开来，阔得使他们只能望见对岸的侧边，那真是一条十分宽阔的大壕沟。当他们爬到沟边望下去时，也可以看见这沟是十分深的，在那沟底下面有许多巨大的锯齿形的石块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天亮了，小女孩子醒来起身，在一条水声潺潺的小河里，洗过了她的脸后，立刻和大家一块儿动身，向翡翠城进发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是稻草人不在乎放满一篮子的硬壳果，要花怎样长的时间，因为干这件事情，能够使他离开那火，他害怕这一股闪闪发光的东西，可以钻进他的稻草，因此烧死了他。所以他和火焰保持着一个相当远的距离，不过当多萝茜躺下去睡觉的时候，他跑近她的身边去，用干叶子遮盖着她。这些树叶子，使她觉得十分舒适和温暖，一直酣睡到早晨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我愿意，”稻草人坚决地说：“因为，如果你发觉你不能够跳过这个深沟时，多萝茜将被跌死的，或者铁皮人跌在下面的石块上，会剧烈地撞坏的。但是如果我坐在你背上，就不在乎这些了，因为摔了下去也丝毫不能伤害我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子回过去，第三次驮了铁皮人过来。于是他们一起坐下来歇了一会儿，让狮子有一个休息的机会。因为它的几次大跳，使得它呼吸短促，气喘得像一只跑得太长久的大狗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="稻草人问：“为什么你不跑着跳过去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because that isn't the way we Lions do these things," he replied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the ditch again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不是我们狮子跳的方式，”它回答说。马上来了一个大跳，迅疾地跃过空中，平安地登上那一边。他们看它这样容易地跳过去，皆大欢喜。当稻草人从它的背上下来以后，狮子再跳回到壕沟的这边来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.

<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜想她应该第二个过去，所以在她的臂弯里带着托托，爬上狮子的背，一只手紧紧地揪住它的鬃毛，一会儿，她似乎在空中飞过。当她还在想的时候，已经平安地到达那一边了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们发觉在这一边的森林，十分深密，望进去模糊而且黑暗。狮子休息好了以后，他们沿着黄砖铺砌的路出发，寂静无声，他们每一个都在心上想，能不能够跑出这森林，再跑到有明亮的太阳的地方去。不久，他们在树林深处，听到有一种奇异的声音，加深了他们的不愉快。狮子低声地对他们说，这部分的国土，是开力大住的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could not leap across it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然地，他们走到了另外一条壕沟旁边。这一条又阔又深的壕沟，横断在路上，使得狮子立刻知道它跳不过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Scarecrow said: "Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就坐下来商量，应该怎么办，在郑重地思考过以后，稻草人说：“这里有一株大树，挺立在壕沟旁。如果铁皮人能够砍倒它，使它横倒了搁上那一边，我们就能够很容易地走过去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is a first-rate idea," said the Lion. "One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一个第一等的思想，”狮子说，“差不多谁都要尊敬你，在你的头壳里已经有了脑子代替稻草了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁皮人立刻动手，他的斧头劈得这样地猛烈，一会儿，那树几乎要倒下去了。于是狮子就把它有力的前腿，抵住了树干，尽力气推着它。这株大树逐渐倾斜着，砰的一声响，就横着倒躺在壕沟上面，那有枝叶的树顶，落到壕沟的那一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not surprised that you are," returned Dorothy. "They must be dreadful beasts."</div>

<div class="line_en">So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next.
