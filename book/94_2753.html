He's about a year younger, but almost exactly as tall, and they have the same hairstyle and almost the same color too. The only thing that sets them apart is that Elsa is different and the boy has a syndrome, which is a very special kind of difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看着爱莎，但当爱莎回看他时，他却低头让头发盖住了眉眼，就像爱莎有时候会做的那样。他比爱莎小一岁，但差不多高，他们的发型和发色也几乎一样。唯一的不同是，爱莎比较另类，而那男孩生了病，其实也算是另一种“另类”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that was the day Elsa heard the story of the boy with a syndrome. A fairy tale she'd never heard before. A tale so terrible it makes you want to hug yourself as hard as you can. Lennart tells her about the boy's father, who has more hatred in him than anyone could think would be possible to fit into one person. The father used narcotics. Lennart stops himself, and seems worried about frightening Elsa, but she straightens her back and buries her hands in the wurse's fur and says it doesn't matter. Lennart asks if she knows what narcotics are, and she says she's read about them on Wikipedia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，爱莎知道了生病男孩的故事，一个她从没有听过的故事。这故事可怕得让你想将自己的身体紧紧蜷缩起来。莱纳特说，男孩的父亲内心有常人不可想象的仇恨。那父亲吸毒。莱纳特顿了顿，似乎是担心吓到爱莎，但她坐直了身体，双手埋在呜嘶的毛里，说没有关系的。莱纳特问她知不知道毒品是什么，她说自己在维基百科上看过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lennart describes how the father became a different creature when he used drugs. How he became dark in his soul. How he hit the boy's mother while she was pregnant, because he didn't want to become anyone's father. Lennart's eyes start blinking more and more slowly, and he says that maybe it was because the father feared the child would be as he was. Filled with hatred and violence. So when the boy was born, and the doctors said he had a syndrome, the father was beside himself with rage. He couldn't tolerate that the child was different. Maybe it was because he hated everything that was different. Maybe because, when he looked at the boy, he saw everything that was different in himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱纳特形容那父亲在吸毒之后，会变成怎样一个不同的人。灵魂变得阴暗。他在男孩母亲怀孕的时候打她，因为他不想成为任何人的父亲。莱纳特的眼睛开始眨得越来越慢，说也许是因为那父亲害怕孩子会变成像他一样的人——充满仇恨和暴力。当男孩出生，而医生说他有先天性疾病的时候，那父亲愤怒至极。他不能容忍那个孩子和正常人不一样。或许是因为，他讨厌一切异乎寻常的东西。也或许因为，当他看着那男孩时，他看到的所有一切都与自己不同。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sometimes he came home utterly calm and withdrawn. Sometimes he cried, explaining that he'd had to keep out of the way until he'd wrung his own anger out of himself.

<div class="line_en">Lennart inhales unhappily. His and Maud's eyes meet again, then he explains: "But I'm afraid that first of all we have to tell you about our son, Elsa. We have to tell you about Sam. And that's one of the things your grandmother apologizes for in her letter. She writes that she's sorry she saved Sam's life…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Maud's voice cracks until her words are like little whistles: "And then she wrote that she was sorry for writing to say she was sorry about it, sorry for regretting that she had saved our son's life. Sorry because she no longer knew if he deserved to live. Even though she was a doctor…"</div>

<div class="line_en">The son of the world's kindest couple, who became more evil than anyone could understand. Who became the father of the boy with a syndrome, who, in turn, had less evil in him than anyone could have believed, as if his father took it all on his shoulders and passed none of it on. She heard the story of how Sam was once a little boy himself, and how Maud and Lennart, who had waited for a child for so long, had loved him, as parents love their children. As all parents, even the very, very worst possible, must at some point have loved their children. That is how Maud puts it. "Because otherwise one can't be a human being, I just can't imagine one could be a human otherwise," she whispers. And she insists that it has to be her fault, because she can't imagine that any child is born evil. It has to be the mother's fault if a boy who was once so small and helpless grows up into something so terrible, she's quite sure of that. In spite of Elsa saying that Granny always said some people are actually just shits and that it's no one else's fault other than the shit's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世界上最善良的一对父母的儿子，却变成了无人能理解的恶魔，变成了生病男孩的父亲。而男孩的身上没有一丝邪恶，就好像他父亲自己承担了一切，没有将分毫传给他的儿子。她聆听着这故事。山姆曾经也是个小男孩，是莫德和莱纳特期盼了很久的孩子，他们深爱着他。所有父母，就算再怎么不可能，都曾经爱过他们的孩子。这是莫德说的。“否则，那就不是人类了，我不相信这世上有没爱过自己孩子的父母。”她轻声说。她坚持说是自己的错，因为她不能想象有哪个孩子一生下来就是邪恶的。如果一个无助的小男孩成长为一个坏人，那一定是母亲的错。她坚持这么认为，并不理会爱莎说的——外婆总说有些人就是一坨屎，那不是任何人的错，只能怪那坨屎本身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she talks about a boy who grew up and always fought, always tormented other children at school, always chased those who were different. And about how when he was an adult he became a soldier and went to far-off lands because he thirsted for war, and how he met a friend there. His first real friend. About how everyone who saw it said that it had changed him, brought out something good in him. His friend was also a soldier, but another sort of soldier, without that thirst.

He convinced Sam and the rest of the soldiers to stay until the village was safe, and took as many injured children as they could fit into their cars to the nearest hospital, many miles away, because Sam's friend knew a woman who worked as a doctor there, and everyone said she was the most skillful surgeon in the whole world.</div>
