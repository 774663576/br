<div class="line_en">Often, when I looked back over my first three months as an immortal, I imagined how the thread of my life might look in the Fates' loom -- who knew but that it actually existed? I was sure my thread must have changed color; I thought it had probably started out as a nice beige, something supportive and non-confrontational, something that would look good in the background. Now it felt like it must be bright crimson, or maybe glistening gold.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was surprised by some of the threads I got to include in my life. The werewolves, with their deep, woodsy colors, were not something I'd expected; Jacob, of course, and Seth, too. But my old friends Quil and Embry became part of the fabric as they joined Jacob's pack, and even Sam and Emily were cordial. The tensions between our families eased, mostly due to Renesmee. She was easy to love.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sue seemed to have taken it on herself to smooth Charlie's transition into the world of make-believe. She came with him to the Cullens' most days, though she never seemed truly comfortable here the way her son and most of Jake's pack did. She did not speak often; she just hovered protectively near Charlie. She was always the first person he looked to when Renesmee did something disturbingly advanced -- which was often. In answer, Sue would eye Seth meaningfully as if to say, Yeah, tell me about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏似乎自发的承担起了帮助查理适应这个“虚幻”世界的任务。她总是陪他来卡伦家这边，虽然自己对这儿也不太适应，不像她儿子还有杰克的那些同伴那样。她不经常讲话，只是保护性的在查理周围徘徊。当蕾妮斯梅又有了什么令人不安的成长时，查理求助的眼神总是第一个就给了她。作为回答，苏就会很意味深长的瞄着塞思，像是在说：嗯，还不告诉我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leah was even less comfortable than Sue and was the only part of our recently extended family who was openly hostile to the merger. However, she and Jacob had a new camaraderie that kept her close to us all. I asked him about it once -- hesitantly; I didn't want to pry, but the relationship was so different from the way it used to be that it made me curious. He shrugged and told me it was a pack thing. She was his second-in -- command now, his "beta," as I'd called it once long ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但比起利亚，苏还算适应的好的了。利亚是唯一一个作为我们的新成员又反对两家合并的。但不管怎么说，她还是和雅各布发展出一种新的类似同志的感情，让她和我们亲密起来。有一次我吞吞吐吐的问他这事，不是想打探什么，但这种关系跟原来的完全不同，让我非常好奇。他只是耸耸肩告诉我，是狼群的事。现在她是他的副官了，是他的“beta”，很久以前我听说过的那种。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a flipside to the joy, though. If you turned the fabric of our lives over, I imagined the design on the backside would be woven in the bleak grays of doubt and fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事物总是两面的。当翻过光鲜漂亮的挂毯时，我以为另一面会是用一种寒冷灰色的怀疑和害怕编织而成。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Renesmee spoke her first word when she was exactly one week old. The word was Momma, which would have made my day, except that I was so frightened by her progress I could barely force my frozen face to smile back at her. It didn't help that she continued from her first word to her first sentence in the same breath. "Momma, where is Grandpa?" she'd asked in a clear, high soprano, only bothering to speak aloud because I was across the room from her. She'd already asked Rosalie, using her normal (or seriously abnormal, from another point of view) means of communication. Rosalie hadn't known the answer, so Renesmee had turned to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮斯梅刚满一周时，她讲了人生第一个词——妈妈，这让我一整天都合不拢嘴，除了因为对她的进步实在是太惊讶了而僵在那里，以至于忘了向她回笑。但这没有阻止她马上从第一个词发展到第一句话：“妈妈，外公在哪儿？”她用清晰的女高音般的说，只是有点太大声，因为我在房间的另一边。她甚至还问罗莎莉，用她平常的（或者从另一个角度说，非常不正常的）交流方式。不过罗莎莉并不知道答案，所以她又回过头看我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she walked for the first time, fewer than three weeks later, it was similar. She'd simply stared at Alice for a long moment, watching intently as her aunt arranged bouquets in the vases scattered around the room, dancing back and forth across the floor with her arms full of flowers. Renesmee got to her feet, not in the least bit shaky, and crossed the floor almost as gracefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个多星期前，她第一次走路的时候，情形也非常相似。一开始她只是观察了爱丽丝好几十分钟，看着自己的阿姨忙着为房间各处的花瓶插花，捧着一堆的鲜花优雅的跑上跑下。于是蕾妮斯梅自己站起来，一点晃荡都没有，用同样优雅的步子在地板上走着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob had burst into applause, because that was clearly the response Renesmee wanted. The way he was tied to her made his own reactions secondary; his first reflex was always to give Renesmee whatever she needed. But our eyes met, and I saw all the panic in mine echoed in his. I made my hands clap together, too, trying to hide my fear from her. Edward applauded quietly at my side, and we didn't need to speak our thoughts to know they were the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布送上一阵热烈的掌声，很清楚的知道这是她想要的回应。跟她的联系，让他自己的行为都变得异常起来；他的第一反应永远是给她想要的任何东西，无论是什么。但当我们眼神交汇的时候，我能看见他眼里跟我一样的惊慌失措。不管怎样，我还是鼓起掌来，不想让她发现自己的害怕。爱德华安静的在我身边拍着手，不需要语言也能明白彼此想着同样的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At three months, Renesmee could have been a big one-year-old, or a small two-year -- old. She wasn't shaped exactly like a toddler; she was leaner and more graceful, her proportions were more even, like an adult's. Her bronze ringlets hung to her waist; I couldn't bear to cut them, even if Alice would have allowed it. Renesmee could speak with flawless grammar and articulation, but she rarely bothered, preferring to simply show people what she wanted. She could not only walk but run and dance. She could even read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个月的时间，蕾妮斯梅就长得像一个一岁多、或者说不到两岁的孩子了。但体型并不太像刚学会走路的小孩，更苗条和优雅，反而像个成人的。褐色的卷发长到腰处，即便爱丽丝也同意把它剪了，我还是下不了手。现在蕾妮斯梅能用精准的语法和发音讲话了，却很少叽叽喳喳，她比较喜欢直接把自己想要说的东西秀给我们看。除了慢步，她还能跑能跳能舞，甚至还会看书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice and Rosalie usually began our day with a fashion show. Renesmee never wore the same clothes twice, partly because she outgrew her clothes almost immediately and partly because Alice and Rosalie were trying to create a baby album that appeared to span years rather than weeks. They took thousands of pictures, documenting every phase of her accelerated childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天都是从爱丽丝和罗莎莉的服装秀开始，连蕾妮斯梅都从来没穿过同样的衣服。一部分是因为她长的太快，衣服都是用过就小了；另一部分更是因为爱丽丝和罗莎莉试图在这几个星期的时间里，整理出一个看上去像是几年时间的宝宝相册。她们拍了几千张相片，几乎把她加速着前进的童年的每一刻都记录下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd been reading Tennyson to her one night, because the flow and rhythm of his poetry seemed restful. (I had to search constantly for new material; Renesmee didn't like repetition in her bedtime stories as other children supposedly did, and she had no patience for picture books.) She reached up to touch my cheek, the image in her mind one of us, only with her holding the book. I gave it to her, smiling.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carlisle and Edward discussed our options for the future from every angle in low voices that I tried not to hear. They never had these discussions when Jacob was around, because there was one sure way to halt aging, and that wasn't something Jacob was likely to be excited about. I wasn't. Too dangerous! my instincts screamed at me. Jacob and Renesmee seemed alike in so many ways, both half-and-half beings, two things at the same time. And all the werewolf lore insisted that vampire venom was a death sentence rather than a course to immortality…</div>

Caius was planning to send a hunting party to see if I was still human, against their edict (because I knew about the secret vampire world, I either must join it or be silenced… permanently).

<div class="line_en">Even in the short time I'd known Aro, I'd been able to see that he was a collector -- and his most prized treasures were his living pieces. He coveted beauty, talent, and rarity in his immortal followers more than any jewel locked in his vaults. It was unfortunate enough that he'd begun to covet Alice's and Edward's abilities. I would give him no more reason to be jealous of Carlisle's family. Renesmee was beautiful and gifted and unique -- she was one of a kind. He could not be allowed to see her, not even through someone's thoughts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice did not see any trouble with my trip, but she was worried by the indistinct quality of her visions. She said they were sometimes similarly hazy when there were outside decisions that might conflict but that had not been solidly resolved. This uncertainty made Edward, already hesitant, extremely opposed to what I had to do. He wanted to come with me as far as my connection in London, but I wouldn't leave Renesmee without both her parents. Carlisle was coming instead. It made both Edward and me a little more relaxed, knowing that Carlisle would be only a few hours away from me.</div>
