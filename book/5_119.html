<div class="line_en">Tully shouldn't have drunk so much. She stood on the stage, holding Johnny's hand to keep herself steady. "Thank you all," she said, flashing her smile to the crowd. "The Girlfriend Hour is so successful because of you." She lifted a glass to everyone, and they answered with applause. It occurred to her in a burst that her sentence hadn't been quite right, had maybe made no sense, but since she couldn't remember what she'd said, it was hard to tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉不该喝这么多。她站在舞台上，抓着强尼的手以免摔倒。“谢谢大家。”她对所有来宾嫣然一笑，“《私房话时间》因为有你们才能成功。”她举杯向所有人致意，台下掌声如雷。她忽然发觉自己说的话好像颠三倒四，似乎毫无意义，但她不记得自己说了什么，所以很难判断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The band started up; they were playing a slow song. Tully took his hand and led him out to the dance floor. She was still laughing when she recognized the song: "Crazy for You."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乐团开始演奏，这是首慢歌。塔莉牵着他的手领他进舞池，她笑得很开心，过了许久才察觉这首曲子是麦当娜的《为你疯狂》。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这是他们在婚宴上开舞的曲子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully tilted her head and looked up at him; suddenly she was remembering what she shouldn't remember: the last time she'd danced in his arms. The song had been "Didn't We Almost Have it All?" and when the dance was over, he'd kissed her. If she'd chosen differently back then, reached for love instead of fame, maybe he would have loved her, given her Marah and a home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉歪着头，抬起视线看他，霎时，不该忆起的回忆窜进脑海：她最后一次在他怀中跳舞的感受。那时的曲子是惠特妮·休斯顿的《我们不是近乎完美吗》，那支舞跳完之后，他吻了她。假使当初她做了不同的决定，选择爱情而非名声，或许他会爱上她，给她和玛拉一个家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the pale golden light from the old-fashioned chandelier, he looked as handsome as she'd ever seen him. He had the kind of dark Irish looks that only improved with age. Somehow the way he looked at her, so seriously, reminded her of the old days, when he'd been just a little broken by life, and she'd made him laugh for that one romantic night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老式水晶灯的浅金色灯光下，他显得无比英俊，那种爱尔兰人的深沉俊美随着时间变得更有韵味。他看着她的眼神很认真，让她想起当年他因为人生不顺遂而忧郁颓废，她给了他一夜的浪漫欢笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不该喝那么多香槟，我快跟不上你的舞步了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You always were a good dancer," she said, and as she said it, she felt a little flare of caution go up. She was drunk; she needed to draw away, but it felt so good to be in a man's arms, and it wasn't like anything would happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的舞技一直很不错。”话一说出口，她立刻察觉不对。她喝醉了，她应该拉开距离，但是在这男人怀中的感觉好舒服，何况他们之间不可能发生什么事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Following has never been your strong suit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“跟随向来不是你的强项。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And with those few words, she remembered all of it again, the details. Memories came crashing through the walls she'd built to contain them. She stopped and looked up at him. "What happened to us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话再次勾起她的回忆，所有细节清晰无比。她原本建了一道墙阻隔那些记忆，但现在瞬间溃堤，她停下脚步，抬头看他，“我们当年为什么分开？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was there ever an 'us,' Tully, really?" he asked quietly. The way he said it, so easily, so quickly, made her wonder if he'd been wanting to ask the question for years. She couldn't tell if his smile was rueful or indulgent; all she knew was that they were no longer dancing, but he hadn't let her go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“塔莉，当年我们真的在一起过吗？”他轻声问。他回答得太快、太自然，她不禁怀疑这个问题是否藏在他心中很多年了。她无法判断他的笑容是惆怅或纵容，她只知道舞步停了，但他没有放开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully knew that, had always known it. Without ever actually talking about their shared past with Johnny, she and Kate had tucked it away in the name of friendship. There in the dark was where it should remain, but as always with Tully, booze and loneliness weakened her, and so, despite her best intentions, she found herself asking, "Did you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉知道，一直都很清楚。塔莉与强尼过去的那段韵事，她和凯蒂从不提起，为了维护友谊而深深埋藏。这段往事应该永远留在黑暗中，但塔莉酒醉又寂寞时总是特别软弱，于是尽管知道不应该，她还是问了：“不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully was on the dance floor, hanging all over Johnny. He held her with an easy familiarity, as if they'd spent a lifetime together. Although they should have been dancing, they were just standing there, a still pair amid the colorful swirl of the other dancers. Tully was looking up at him as if she'd just asked him to take her to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉在舞池中，整个人黏在强尼身上，他抱着她的动作很轻松自在，仿佛他们在一起过了一辈子。他们应该要跳舞，但他们只是站在那里，静静矗立在形形色色回旋舞动的人海中。塔莉抬起头看他，那眼神仿佛要求他带她上床。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The song always made her smile. At the entrance to the ballroom, she paused, looking around. The dinner tables were emptying out. Lines were forming again at the bar. She saw Marah in the corner, talking to a remarkably skinny girl in a dress that was smaller than a handkerchief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次听到这首歌她都会微笑。进入宴会厅后，她停下脚步，环顾四周。宴席已经散了，宾客聚集在酒吧边排队，她看到玛拉站在角落和一个年轻女生说话，她瘦得可怕，身上的布料比手帕还小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The song ended and Johnny stepped back from Tully. Turning, he saw Kate. Through the jeweled array of gowns, their gazes met. There, in front of anyone who might be watching, she started to cry. Embarrassed, she walked out of the ballroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一曲奏罢，强尼放开塔莉后退，一转身正好看见凯蒂。隔着珠光宝气的衣香鬓影，他们四目交会，她当场哭了出来，不顾会被多少人看见。她觉得很丢脸，于是走出会场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two weeks later, Tully stood at the window of her enormous office, staring out. She'd known for ages that something was missing in her life. She'd hoped that moving back to Seattle and starting her own show would somehow fill that empty place inside of her, but she hadn't been so lucky. Now she was simply more famous, endlessly wealthy, and still vaguely dissatisfied.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're insane," Johnny said, pacing in front of the window that looked out over Elliott Bay. "Format is king in television. You know that. Our ratings are second only to Oprah, and last year you were nominated for an Emmy. Companies can't line up fast enough to provide giveaways and promos to our audience. These are indicators of success."</div>

Like most girls her age, she was too thin, a jangle of points and hollows, but none of that mattered. She was the kind of girl who'd be called coltish until she was thirty; that was when she'd settle into her body like royalty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点也不晚，快进来吧。”她后退让玛拉先进去。干女儿总是令她惊为天人，现在也不例外。这个年纪的少女大多过瘦，全身都是明显的凸起与凹陷，玛拉也一样，但无损她的美貌。她是那种在三十岁之前都会被称为俏丽的女生，过了那个年纪就会适应自己的身体，流露出王族般的气质。">查看中文翻译</div>
