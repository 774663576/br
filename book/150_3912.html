<div class="line_en">"Missionaries always have large dining-tables," Waddington explained. "They get so much a year more for every child they have and they buy their tables when they marry so that there shall be plenty of room for little strangers."</div>

<div class="line_en">From the ceiling hung a large paraffin lamp, so that Kitty was able to see better what sort of a man Waddington was. His baldness had deceived her into thinking him no longer young, but she saw now that he must be well under forty. His face, small under a high, rounded forehead, was unlined and fresh-coloured; it was ugly like a monkey's, but with an ugliness that was not without charm; it was an amusing face. His features, his nose and his mouth, were hardly larger than a child's, and he had small, very bright blue eyes. His eyebrows were fair and scanty. He looked like a funny little old boy. He helped himself constantly to liquor and as dinner proceeded it became evident that he was far from sober. But if he was drunk it was without offensiveness, gaily, as a satyr might be who had stolen a wine-skin from a sleeping shepherd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋顶上悬挂着一盏石蜡灯，这时候凯蒂可以更清楚地观察韦丁顿一番。他秃了顶的头曾误使她以为他已经不再年轻，然而现在看来他应该还不到四十岁。他有着高高圆圆的额头，额头以下的脸很小，但是圆圆胖胖的，毫无棱角，脸色也十分红润。这张脸很像猴子的脸，虽然难看，但是不乏魅力，因为它十分逗趣。他的五官里面，鼻子和嘴大小跟小孩的差不多；眼睛不算大，但是又亮又蓝；他的眉毛是浅色的，十分稀疏。远远看去，他活像是一个老男孩儿。他不停地给自己倒酒，随着晚餐的进行，凯蒂越加觉得他这个人一点也不郑重内敛。不过，就算是他喝醉了酒，也没有说出什么酒过伤人的话，反而是兴高采烈，样子颇像一个酒过三巡的好色之徒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From the other side of the river they heard the beating of gongs and the clatter of fire-crackers. There, so short a way from them, the great city lay in terror; and death, sudden and ruthless, hurried through its tortuous streets. But Waddington began to speak of London. He talked of the theatres. He knew everything that was being played at the moment and he told them what pieces he had seen when he was last home on leave. He laughed as he recollected the humour of this low comedian and sighed as he reflected on the beauty of that star of musical comedy. He was pleased to be able to boast that a cousin of his had married one of the most celebrated. He had lunched with her and she had given him her photograph. He would show it to them when they came and dined with him at the Customs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河的对岸响起了听听铛铛的敲锣声，接着爆竹也劈劈啪啪地响了起来。在那里，离他们不远的地方，一座城镇正处于惊恐之中；死亡随时会无情地光顾那些曲曲折折的街巷。但是韦丁顿却开始谈起了伦敦。他的话题放到了戏院上。他清楚地知道此刻伦敦正在上演哪出剧目，还将上次临来之时看的一出戏的细节娓娓道来。当他讲到那位滑稽的男演员时不禁哈哈大笑，而描述起那位音乐剧女明星的美貌来，却又叹息不已。他高兴地告知他们，他的一个表弟已经同一位杰出的女明星成了婚。他曾与她共进午餐，并荣幸地受赠了一张她的玉照。等他们到海关做客时，他会把照片拿出来给他们一看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shouldn't wonder," he answered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Walter looked at his guest with a cold and ironic gaze, but he was evidently not a little amused by him, and he made an effort to show a civil interest in topics of which Kitty was well aware he knew nothing. A faint smile lingered on his lips. But Kitty, she knew not why, was filled with awe. In the house of that dead missionary, over against the stricken city, they seemed immeasurably apart from all the world. Three solitary creatures and strangers to each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦尔特专注地看着他的客人，但目光漠然且略带嘲讽，显然他丝毫没有被对方的幽默所打动。他试图礼貌地想对那些话题表示兴趣，但凯蒂明白他其实一无所知。话间，瓦尔特始终面带着微笑，然而凯蒂的心里却不明所以地充满了恐惧。在这座已故传教士留下的房子里，虽然离那座瘟疫肆虐的城市仅一水之隔，但是他们似乎与整个世界完全隔绝。坐在这里的仅仅是三个孤独且彼此陌生的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
