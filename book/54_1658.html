<div class="line_en">I was eager to be in the fields again, to feel the furrowed rows of damp, soft earth beneath my feet; eager to walk barefooted through the cool forest, hug the trees, and sit under their protective shadow. But although every living thing knew it was spring, Miss Crocker and the other teachers evidently did not, for school lingered on indefinitely. In the last week of March when Papa and Mr. Morrison began to plow the east field, I volunteered to sacrifice school and help them. My offer was refused and I trudged wearily to school for another week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想到田里去，踩着犁过的田地，感受温热的泥土覆上我的双脚。我想到森林里去，光着双脚走着，拥抱一棵树，在树荫底下坐着。所有人，所有生物，都知道春天来了，可克洛克小姐和学校里的其他老师却无动于衷。三月最后一个星期，爸爸和莫里森先生已经开始犁东边的田了，我提出放弃这学期剩下的学业来帮他们，不过被拒绝了。我只好拖着沉重的步伐继续到学校去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Spring. It seeped unseen into the waiting red earth in early March, softening the hard ground for the coming plow and awakening life that had lain gently sleeping through the cold winter.</div>

<div class="line_en">But by the end of March it was evident every- where: in the barn where three new calves bellowed and chicks the color of soft pale sunlight chirped; in the yard where the wisteria and English dogwood bushes readied themselves for their annual Easter bloom, and the fig tree budded producing the forerunners of juicy, brown fruit for which the boys and I would have to do battle with fig-loving Jack; and in the smell of the earth itself. Rain-drenched, fresh, vital, full of life, spring enveloped all of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了三月底，处处是春的模样：谷仓里，三只小牛“哞哞”叫着，小鸡们也跟着“叽叽喳喳”；院子里，紫藤与山茱萸等待着开苞结果，而无花果树已经挂上了多汁美味的果实，我和男孩们还得跟喜爱无花果果实的杰克争抢。哦，还有泥土的气息。大雨过后，空气中清新自然的味道将我们环抱。">查看中文翻译</div>
