<div class="line_en">It all starts with the boy waking up late in the afternoon and feeling hungry. The wurse and Samantha come flopping out of the wardrobe because the mulled wine is finished. Elsa marches in circles around Alf and intimates that it's time to get the Santa suit. Elsa and the wurse follow Alf down to the garage. He gets into Taxi. When Elsa opens the passenger door and sticks her head in and asks what he's doing, he turns the ignition key and grunts: "If I have to impersonate Santa for the rest of the day, I'm nipping out for a newspaper first."</div>

And when Alf grumpily taps the meter and points out that taxi journeys cost money, Elsa says that she'd like to have this taxi journey as her Christmas present. And then Alf looks very grumpy for a long time, and then they go off for Elsa's Christmas present.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是。”阿尔夫回答，似乎这件事情不言而喻。受到这话的冲击，爱莎看着他并等待着，因为她知道只有等待才能让他说出整个故事。快八岁的小孩明白这道理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then after two red lights Alf sighs resignedly, like you do while preparing yourself to tell a story even though you don't like telling stories. And then he recounts the tale of Britt-Marie. And himself. Although the latter part may not be his intention. There are quite a lot of swearwords in it, and Elsa has to exert herself quite a lot not to correct the grammar. But after a lot of "ifs" and "buts" and quite a few "damneds," Alf has explained that he and Kent grew up with their mother in the flat where Alf now lives. When Alf was ten, another family moved into the flat above theirs, with two daughters of the same age as Alf and Kent. The mother was a renowned singer and the father wore a suit and was always at work. The elder sister, Ingrid, apparently had an outstanding singing talent. She was going to be a star, her mother explained to Alf and Kent's mother. She never said anything about the other daughter, Britt-Marie. Alf and Kent caught sight of her anyway. It was impossible not to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个红灯之后，阿尔夫无奈地叹了口气，准备说出这个他并不想说出的故事。接着他详细讲述了布里特—玛丽以及他自己的故事，虽然后者也许并非他的本意。讲述中含有太多脏话，爱莎也尽力控制自己不要去纠正他的语法错误。但在许多许多的“如果”“但是”和“见鬼”之后，阿尔夫解释说，他和肯特以及他们的妈妈曾一起在如今阿尔夫住的公寓里生活。阿尔夫十岁时，另一户人家搬进了楼上的房间，他们家有两个跟阿尔夫、肯特同龄的女儿。那位母亲是知名歌手，父亲总是穿着西装去工作。两个女孩中的姐姐叫英格丽德，拥有惊人的歌唱天赋。她将成为一名巨星，她的母亲对阿尔夫和肯特的妈妈这么说过。她从不提起另一个女儿，布里特—玛丽。尽管如此，阿尔夫和肯特还是注意到了她。不可能不注意到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wasn't at home a great deal, of course, and whenever she was, she was always accompanied by outlandish friends and, from time to time, stray dogs. One evening she brought home a large black cur that she'd apparently also won in a game of poker, Alf explains. Alf and Kent and the daughters of the neighboring family only wanted to play with it; they didn't understand that it was sleeping. Alf was quite certain it never meant to bite Britt-Marie, it was just caught unawares. She was too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她经常不在家，而在家时，身边总是围着一群异国朋友，时不时还会有几条流浪狗。有一天傍晚，她带了一条巨大的黑色野狗回家，显然也是在一场扑克牌局里赢来的，阿尔夫解释道。阿尔夫、肯特和邻居家的女孩们只是想跟它玩，他们不明白它在睡觉。阿尔夫很肯定，它并不是故意咬布里特—玛丽的，只是有点儿措手不及。她也是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one remembers exactly when the young female medical student first showed up in the house. One day she was just there in the enormous flat that took up the entire top floor of the house in those days, and when Alf and Kent's mother interrogated her about why she lived by herself in such a big flat, the young female medical student replied that she'd "won it in a game of poker."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人记得那位年轻的医学院女生第一次出现在房子里是什么时候的事。某一天，她就这么出现在了当时占据公寓楼整个顶层的巨大公寓里。阿尔夫和肯特的妈妈询问过她，为什么她一个人住这么大的一套公寓，那个年轻的医学院女生回答说这房子是她“打扑克赢的”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dog disappeared after that. But Britt-Marie's mother still hated the young medical student, and nothing anyone said could make her change her mind. And then came the car accident in the street just outside the house. Britt-Marie's mother never saw the truck. The impact shook the whole building. The mother emerged from the front seat of the car with nothing worse than a few grazes, reeling and confused, but no one came out of the backseat. The mother screamed the most terrible of screams when she saw all the blood. The young medical student came running out in her nightie, her whole face full of cinnamon bun crumbs, and she saw the two girls in the backseat. She had no car of her own and she could only carry one girl. She wedged the door open and saw that one of them was breathing and the other wasn't. She picked up the girl who was still breathing and ran. Ran all the way to the hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来那条狗就消失了，但布里特—玛丽的妈妈还是非常恨那个年轻的女学生，没人能改变她的想法。然后就发生了那场房子外的车祸。布里特—玛丽的妈妈没有看见那辆卡车。撞击震撼了整栋楼。母亲爬出驾驶座，只有一点儿擦伤、头晕和迷糊，但没人从后座出来。当那位母亲看见到处都是鲜血时，她发出了最可怕的尖叫声。年轻的医学院女生穿着睡衣跑了出来，满脸都是肉桂卷屑。她看见了后座的两个女孩。她没有自己的车，只能带上一个女孩。她撬开车门，看见一个女孩还有呼吸，而另一个没有。她抱起那个还在呼吸的女孩，一路跑去了医院。">查看中文翻译</div>
