<div class="line_en">My mother used to tell me, "I chose to have you because I wanted something to love and something that would love me unconditionally in return." I was a product of her search for belonging. She never felt like she belonged anywhere. She didn't belong to her mother, didn't belong to her father, didn't belong with her siblings. She grew up with nothing and wanted something to call her own.</div>

<div class="line_en">My grandparents' marriage was an unhappy one. They met and married in Sophiatown, but one year later the army came in and drove them out. The government seized their home and bulldozed the whole area to build a fancy, new white suburb, Triomf. Triumph. Along with tens of thousands of other black people, my grandparents were forcibly relocated to Soweto, to a neighborhood called the Meadowlands. They divorced not long after that, and my grandmother moved to Orlando with my mom, my aunt, and my uncle.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mom was the problem child, a tomboy, stubborn, defiant. My gran had no idea how to raise her. Whatever love they had was lost in the constant fighting that went on between them. But my mom adored her father, the charming, charismatic Temperance. She went gallivanting with him on his manic misadventures. She'd tag along when he'd go drinking in the shebeens. All she wanted in life was to please him and be with him. She was always being swatted away by his girlfriends, who didn't like having a reminder of his first marriage hanging around, but that only made her want to be with him all the more.</div>

<div class="line_en">When my mother was nine years old, she told my gran that she didn't want to live with her anymore. She wanted to live with her father. "If that's what you want," Gran said, "then go." Temperance came to pick my mom up, and she happily bounded up into his car, ready to go and be with the man she loved. But instead of taking her to live with him in the Meadowlands, without even telling her why, he packed her off and sent her to live with his sister in the Xhosa homeland, Transkei -- he didn't want her, either. My mom was the middle child. Her sister was the eldest and firstborn. Her brother was the only son, bearer of the family name. They both stayed in Soweto, were both raised and cared for by their parents. But my mom was unwanted. She was the second girl. The only place she would have less value would be China.</div>

<div class="line_en">The homelands were, ostensibly, the original homes of South Africa's tribes, sovereign and semi-sovereign "nations" where black people would be "free." Of course, this was a lie. For starters, despite the fact that black people made up over 80 percent of South Africa's population, the territory allocated for the homelands was about 13 percent of the country's land. There was no running water, no electricity. People lived in huts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从表面上看，黑人家园就是南非部落的原址，它们是主权或半主权的“国家”，在这里的黑人都是“自由的”。当然了，这是个谎言。首先，黑人人口占了整个南非人口的80%之多，但黑人家园的领土只占整个国家领土的13%。那里没有自来水，没有电，人们住在棚屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Where South Africa's white countryside was lush and irrigated and green, the black lands were overpopulated and overgrazed, the soil depleted and eroding. Other than the menial wages sent home from the cities, families scraped by with little beyond subsistence-level farming. My mother's aunt hadn't taken her in out of charity. She was there to work. "I was one of the cows," my mother would later say, "one of the oxen." She and her cousins were up at half past four, plowing fields and herding animals before the sun baked the soil as hard as cement and made it too hot to be anywhere but in the shade.</div>

<div class="line_en">But my mother was blessed that her village was one of the places where a mission school had contrived to stay open in spite of the government's Bantu education policies. There she had a white pastor who taught her English. She didn't have food or shoes or even a pair of underwear, but she had English. She could read and write. When she was old enough she stopped working on the farm and got a job at a factory in a nearby town. She worked on a sewing machine making school uniforms. Her pay at the end of each day was a plate of food. She used to say it was the best food she'd ever eaten, because it was something she had earned on her own. She wasn't a burden to anyone and didn't owe anything to anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我妈妈还算幸运的，尽管政府实施了班图教育政策，这个村子里有一所教会学校还在坚持开门。她在那里遇到了一位白人牧师，教她学英语。尽管她没有吃的，没有鞋，连一套内衣都没有，但她学会了英语。她可以读，可以写。长大一点儿后，她就离开了农场，去隔壁镇的工厂找了份工作。工作是坐在缝纫机前缝校服，每天的报酬是一盘食物。她经常说，那是她吃过最好吃的东西，因为那是她自己挣来的。她自己照顾自己，不再是任何人的负担，也不欠别人任何。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For dinner there might be one chicken to feed fourteen children. My mom would have to fight with the bigger kids to get a handful of meat or a sip of the gravy or even a bone from which to suck out some marrow. And that's when there was food for dinner at all. When there wasn't, she'd steal food from the pigs. She'd steal food from the dogs. The farmers would put out scraps for the animals, and she'd jump for it. She was hungry; let the animals fend for themselves. There were times when she literally ate dirt. She would go down to the river, take the clay from the riverbank, and mix it with the water to make a grayish kind of milk. She'd drink that to feel full.</div>

<div class="line_en">So many black families spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past. That is the curse of being black and poor, and it is a curse that follows you from generation to generation. My mother calls it "the black tax." Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring everyone behind you back up to zero. Working for the family in Soweto, my mom had no more freedom than she'd had in Transkei, so she ran away. She ran all the way down to the train station and jumped on a train and disappeared into the city, determined to sleep in public restrooms and rely on the kindness of prostitutes until she could make her own way in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有太多的黑人家庭穷极一生在填补过去的缺口。这是身为黑人以及贫穷的诅咒，这也是一代代人无法逃离的梦魇。我母亲将其称为“黑人债”。因为你的长辈们已经被剥夺殆尽，你不能把这些钱用在自己身上，让自己进步，你只能把你挣来的钱给他们，把他们拉回生活的起点。在索韦托的家里，我妈妈获得的自由并不比在特兰斯凯的时候多，所以她又逃离了。她径直跑到火车站，跳上一列车，消失在了城市中。她下定决心，哪怕要睡在公共厕所，哪怕要依赖好心妓女们的善意帮助，她也要自己闯出一片天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When my mom turned twenty-one, her aunt fell ill and that family could no longer keep her in Transkei. My mom wrote to my gran, asking her to send the price of a train ticket, about thirty rand, to bring her home. Back in Soweto, my mom enrolled in the secretarial course that allowed her to grab hold of the bottom rung of the white-collar world. She worked and worked and worked but, living under my grandmother's roof, she wasn't allowed to keep her own wages. As a secretary, my mom was bringing home more money than anyone else, and my grandmother insisted it all go to the family. The family needed a radio, an oven, a refrigerator, and it was now my mom's job to provide it.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mom told me these things so that I'd never take for granted how we got to where we were, but none of it ever came from a place of self-pity. "Learn from your past and be better because of your past," she would say, "but don't cry about your past. Life is full of pain. Let the pain sharpen you, but don't hold on to it. Don't be bitter." And she never was. The deprivations of her youth, the betrayals of her parents, she never complained about any of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as she let the past go, she was determined not to repeat it: my childhood would bear no resemblance to hers. She started with my name. The names Xhosa families give their children always have a meaning, and that meaning has a way of becoming self-fulfilling. You have my cousin, Mlungisi. "The Fixer." That's who he is. Whenever I got into trouble he was the one trying to help me fix it. He was always the good kid, doing chores, helping around the house. You have my uncle, the unplanned pregnancy, Velile. "He Who Popped Out of Nowhere." And that's all he's done his whole life, disappear and reappear. He'll go off on a drinking binge and then pop back up out of nowhere a week later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走出了过去的阴影，并决心不会再重复过去：我的童年绝不能像她的一样，从取名开始。科萨家庭给自己小孩取的名字总要带有点儿什么含义，而且这个含义总能在他后面的人生中有所体现。譬如我的表哥穆隆格斯的名字意为“修补的人”。他真的就是这样的人。每当我遇到麻烦，他总会过来帮我摆平事情。他是一贯的好孩子，会做家务，处理家事。而我的舅舅维莱尔，他是意外怀孕生下的孩子，名字的意思是“不知从哪儿冒出来的人”。而这基本就是他一生的写照，他总是动不动就消失，然后又突然出现。他可以跑去喝酒狂欢，人就不见了，然后一个星期后不知道从哪儿又冒出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother never sat me down and told me the whole story of her life in Transkei. She'd give me little bursts, random details, stories of having to keep her wits about her to avoid getting raped by strange men in the village. She'd tell me these things and I'd be like, Lady, clearly you do not know what kind of stories to be telling a ten-year-old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我妈妈从来没有坐下和我好好讲过她在特兰斯凯的故事。她只是偶尔爆一两句料，随便讲一点儿细节，譬如怎么在村庄中保持警惕，不被陌生男人强奸这种事。每当她跟我讲起这些，我就想，女士，你可能不知道十岁的小孩适合听什么样的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then you have my mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. "She Who Gives Back." That's what she does. She gives and gives and gives. She did it even as a girl in Soweto. Playing in the streets she would find toddlers, three- and four-year-olds, running around unsupervised all day long. Their fathers were gone and their mothers were drunks. My mom, who was only six or seven herself, used to round up the abandoned kids and form a troop and take them around to the shebeens. They'd collect empties from the men who were passed out and take the bottles to where you could turn them in for a deposit. Then my mom would take that money, buy food in the spaza shops, and feed the kids. She was a child taking care of children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我妈妈的名字叫帕特莉莎·努拜伊赛罗·诺亚，意思是“奉献的人”。这也是她一直在做的事。她总是在奉献，奉献，奉献。当她还是个住在索韦托的小女孩时，就已经是这样了。她在街上玩的时候，经常碰到三四岁大没人管的小孩满街乱跑，这种孩子的父亲应该是不在身边，而母亲则一直酗酒。我母亲只有六七岁大，但她会把这样的小孩全都聚到一起，带着他们一起到小酒馆去。他们会从那些醉倒的大人身边捡空酒瓶，带去可以换瓶子的地方，拿到找回的零钱。然后她会带着这些钱，到小卖铺买吃的，给这些小孩吃。她是一个会照顾小孩的小孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

Church was where we got most of our other books, too. My mom would bring home boxes that white people had donated -- picture books, chapter books, any book she could get her hands on. Then she signed up for a subscription program where we got books in the mail. It was a series of how-to books. How to Be a Good Friend. How to Be Honest. She bought a set of encyclopedias, too; it was fifteen years old and way out of date, but I would sit and pore through those.</div>

<div class="line_en">If my mother had one goal, it was to free my mind. My mother spoke to me like an adult, which was unusual. In South Africa, kids play with kids and adults talk to adults. The adults supervise you, but they don't get down on your level and talk to you. My mom did. All the time. I was like her best friend. She was always telling me stories, giving me lessons, Bible lessons especially. She was big into Psalms. I had to read Psalms every day. She would quiz me on it. "What does the passage mean? What does it mean to you? How do you apply it to your life?" That was every day of my life. My mom did what school didn't. She taught me how to think.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eden Park was a colored neighborhood adjacent to several black townships on the East Rand. Half-colored and half-black, she figured, like us. We'd be camouflaged there. It didn't work out that way; we never fit in at all. But that was her thinking when we made the move. Plus it was a chance to buy a home -- our own home. Eden Park was one of those "suburbs" that are actually out on the edge of civilization, the kind of place where property developers have said, "Hey, poor people. You can live the good life, too. Here's a house. In the middle of nowhere. But look, you have a yard!" For some reason the streets in Eden Park were named after cars: Jaguar Street. Ferrari Street. Honda Street. I don't know if that was a coincidence or not, but it's funny because colored people in South Africa are known for loving fancy cars. It was like living in a white neighborhood with all the streets named after varietals of fine wine.</div>

It was flat, not many trees, the same dusty red-clay dirt and grass as Soweto but with proper houses and paved roads and a sense of suburbia to it. Ours was a tiny house at the bend in the road right off Toyota Street. It was modest and cramped inside, but walking in I thought, Wow. We are really living. It was crazy to have my own room.

On the commute to work and school, there was a long stretch of the road into town that was completely deserted. That's where Mom would let me drive. On the highway. I was six. She'd put me on her lap and let me steer and work the indicators while she worked the pedals and the stick shift. After a few months of that, she taught me how to work the stick. She was still working the clutch, but I'd climb onto her lap and take the stick, and she'd call out the gears as we drove. There was this one part of the road that ran deep into a valley and then back up the other side.

My mom would always say, "My job is to feed your body, feed your spirit, and feed your mind." That's exactly what she did, and the way she found money for food and books was to spend absolutely nothing on anything else. Her frugality was the stuff of legend. Our car was a tin can on wheels, and we lived in the middle of nowhere. We had threadbare furniture, busted old sofas with holes worn through the fabric.

We must have gone to every park in Johannesburg. My mom would sit under a tree and read the Bible, and I'd run and play and play and play. On Sunday afternoons after church, we'd go for drives out in the country. My mom would find places with beautiful views for us to sit and have a picnic. There was none of the fanfare of a picnic basket or plates or anything like that, only baloney and brown bread and margarine sandwiches wrapped up in butcher paper.

My mom used to take me on drives through fancy white neighborhoods. We'd go look at people's houses, look at their mansions. We'd look at their walls, mostly, because that's all we could see from the road. We'd look at a wall that ran from one end of the block to the other and go, "Wow. That's only one house. All of that is for one family." Sometimes we'd pull over and go up to the wall, and she'd put me up on her shoulders like I was a little periscope.

Consider this: Chinese people were classified as black in South Africa. I don't mean they were running around acting black. They were still Chinese. But, unlike Indians, there weren't enough Chinese people to warrant devising a whole separate classification.
