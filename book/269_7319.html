<div class="line_en">Gran hadn't changed much; her face looked just the same as I remembered it. The skin was soft and withered, bent into a thousand tiny creases that clung gently to the bone underneath. Like a dried apricot, but with a puff of thick white hair standing out in a cloud around it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶没有发生很大的变化；她的脸庞还是我记忆中的模样。她的皮肤柔软而松弛，形成一道道弯弯曲曲的小的细纹，轻轻地依附在骨骼上；她像一棵干瘪的杏树，只不过她头上还顶着一团蓬松浓密的白发，像云朵一样盘旋在她的周围，漂浮在空中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们的嘴唇——她的嘴巴干瘪，嘴角布满褶皱——就在同一时间向两边咧开，露出同样惊讶的半个笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reasons I was so certain were that, first, I was standing in a bright shaft of sunlight -- the kind of blinding clear sun that never shone on my drizzly new hometown in Forks, Washington -- and second, I was looking at my Grandma Marie. Gran had been dead for six years now, so that was solid evidence toward the dream theory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我之所以如此确信的理由是：第一，我正站在一束明亮的阳光下——那种令人目眩的，明净的太阳从未照耀在我的新家乡——华盛顿州的福克斯镇上，这里常年笼罩在如烟似雾的绵绵细雨之中；第二，我正注视着玛丽祖母，奶奶至今去世已经有六年多了，因此，这一确凿的证据足以证明我是在做梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

Was Pop okay, and had they found each other, wherever they were? -- but she opened her mouth when I did, so I stopped to let her go first. She paused, too, and then we Goth smiled at the little awkwardness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我正准备问她问题；我有好多问题想要问奶奶——她在我的梦里做什么？她过去六年过得怎么样？爷爷还好吗？无论他们在哪里，他们找到彼此了吗？——但是，她在我开口的时候也张开了嘴巴，所以我停了下来，让她先说。奶奶也停顿了一下，接着，我们俩都感到有些笨拙，笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I panicked because Gran didn't know that I was in love with a vampire -- nobody knew that -- so how was I supposed to explain the fact that the brilliant sun beams were shattering off his skin into a thousand rainbow shards like he was made of crystal or diamond?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我惊慌失措是因为奶奶不知道我和一个吸血鬼相爱了——没有人知道这件事——那么，一束束光辉灿烂的光柱散落成千万颗彩虹般的光珠，洒落到爱德华的皮肤上，使他看起来像是由水晶或钻石做成的一样，我该如何解释这一事实呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bella!" It wasn't Gran who called my name, and we both turned to see the addition to our small reunion. I didn't have to look to know who it was; this was a voice I would know anywhere -- know, and respond to, whether I was awake or asleep… or even dead, I'd bet. The voice I'd walk through fire for -- or, less dramatically, slosh every day through the cold and endless rain for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是贝拉吗”不过不是奶奶在叫我，我们俩都转过身来看着加入到我们两个人的小团聚中的那个人。我没必要看就知道是谁；不管在哪里我都能认出这个声音——它是那么熟悉，无论是在我清醒的时候，还是在睡梦中，…我敢打赌，就算我死了，我都能感应到它的存在。这个声音是我宁愿穿越火海都要寻找到的，——或者，不那么夸张地说，它是我宁愿每天跋涉在寒冷无尽的雨中都要寻找到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was he doing? The whole reason he lived in Forks, the rainiest place in the world, was so that he could be outside in the daytime without exposing his family's secret. Yet here he was, strolling gracefully toward me -- with the most beautiful smile on his angel's face -- as if I were the only one here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正在做什么？他住在福克斯这个世界上最陰雨绵绵的地方的全部原因就是他能够在白天外出，同时又不会暴露他的家族秘密。然而，爱德华现在正优雅地向我款款走来——他天使般的脸庞上挂着最美丽的微笑——仿佛这里只有我一个人一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In that second, I wished that I was not the one exception to his mysterious talent; I usually felt grateful that I was the only person whose thoughts he couldn't hear just as clearly as if they were spoken aloud. But now I wished he could hear me, too, so that he could hear the warning I was screaming in my head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那一刻，我希望我没有被排除在他神秘的天赋之外；而我原先也一直很庆幸他唯独不能看透我的心思，但是现在我希望他也能听清我的想法，这样的话他就能听见我脑海里尖声喊出的警告。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gran's expression surprised me. Instead of looking horrified, she was staring at me sheepishly, as if waiting for a scolding. And she was standing in such a strange position -- one arm held awkwardly away from her body, stretched out and then curled around the air. Like she had her arm around someone I couldn't see, someone invisible…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶的表情令我惊讶不已。她看起来毫不恐惧，相反，她怯懦地盯着我，仿佛在等待责备一样。而且她站立的姿势也很奇怪——一只手臂笨拙地抬了起来，向外伸出去，接着环绕着空气弯曲起来，就像她的胳臂环抱着某个我看不见的人——某个隐形的人一样…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward -- still smiling so beautifully that my heart felt like it was going to swell up and burst through my chest -- put his arm around my shoulder and turned to face my grandmother.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only then, as I looked at the bigger picture, did I notice the huge gilt frame that enclosed my grandmother's form. Uncomprehending, I raised the hand that wasn't wrapped around Edward's waist and reached out to touch her. She mimicked the movement exactly, mirrored it. But where our fingers should have met, there was nothing but cold glass… With a dizzying jolt, my dream abruptly became a nightmare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正大画面逐渐变大的时候，我才注意到围绕着我祖母的巨大的镀金镜框。我根本想不通这是怎么回事，于是我抬起那只没有搂着爱德华的腰的手臂，伸出手想要触摸她。奶奶一模一样地模仿着我的动作，简直就像从镜子里反射出来的一样。但是就在我们的手指头应该相遇的地方，我却只感觉到冷冰冰的玻璃…仿佛遭到狠狠的打击一样，我感到头晕眼花，梦突然变成了梦魇。">查看中文翻译</div>

I stared at myself, looking for some sign of impending wrinkles in my ivory skin.

My eyebrows stayed lodged in a worried line over my anxious brown eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">I struggled to get a grip on myself as I drove to school. The vision of Gran -- I would not think of it as me -- was hard to get out of my head. I couldn't feel anything but despair until I pulled into the familiar parking lot behind Forks High School and spotted Edward leaning motionlessly against his polished silver Volvo, like a marble tribute to some forgotten pagan god of beauty. The dream had not done him justice. And he was waiting there for me, just the same as every other day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在开车到学校去的路上，我努力地控制住自己的情绪。奶奶的幻景——尽管我不会把它当成自己——但是却很难把它从脑海中驱逐出去。除了绝望我毫无感觉，直到当我把车开到福克斯高中后面熟悉的停车场，发现爱德华仿佛一尊美神大理石雕像——那位被遗忘了的异教神——一动不动地靠在他的抛过光的银色沃尔沃轿车上。我的梦没有公正地对待他，他比梦境中更加迷人。爱德华每天都会等我，就像往常一样，他现在正在那儿等我呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course Edward and Alice weren't really related (in Forks the story was that all the Cullen siblings were adopted by Dr. Carlisle Culler and his wife, Esme, both plainly too young to have teenage children), but their skin was precisely the same pale shade, their eyes had the same strange golden tint, with the same deep, bruise -- like shadows beneath them. Her face, like his, was also startlingly beautiful. To someone in the know -- someone like me -- these similarities marked them for what they were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，爱德华和爱丽丝并没有血缘关系（在福克斯流传着这样的故事，卡伦家族所有的兄弟姐妹都是由卡莱尔？卡伦医生和他的妻子埃斯梅领养回来的，他们两个人太年轻了，不可能有十几岁大的孩子），但是他们的脸庞蒙着一层如出一辙的苍白与朦胧，双眸也闪烁着同样奇异的金色光芒，淤青般的陰影笼罩着深深的眼窝。爱丽丝的脸庞像爱德华的一样，美丽得令人惊叹。在知悉内情的人心中——就像我这样的知情人一样——他们的相似之处正是他们真实身份的标记。">查看中文翻译</div>

He smiled now instead, and I was glad he seemed to have accepted that we could only be friends. Mike had changed over the summer -- his face had lost some of the roundness, making his cheek bones more prominent, and he was wearing his pale blond hair a new way; instead of bristly, it was longer and gelled into a carefully casual disarray.

<div class="line_en">We were pulling up to the house now. Bright light shined from every window on the first two floors. Along line of glowing Japanese lanterns hung from the porch eaves, reflecting a soft radiance on the huge cedars that surrounded the house. Big bowls of flowers -- pink roses -- lined the wide stairs up to the front doors.</div>

Alice, I assumed, had covered every flat surface with pink candles and dozens of crystal bowls filled with hundreds of roses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都在巨大的白色客厅里等我们；我一走进门，他们全部齐声唱“祝你生日快乐，贝”欢迎我的到来，我一下脸红了，羞赧地低下头。我猜是爱丽丝用红色的蜡烛和十几个装满几百枝玫瑰花的水晶碗装扮了每层楼的地面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he'd gone back to exactly how he'd acted before -- avoiding me as much as possible -- the moment he was free from that temporary obligation to protect me. I knew it wasn't personal, just a precaution, and I tried not to be overly sensitive about it. Jasper had more trouble sticking to the Cullens' diet than the rest of them; the scent of human blood was much harder for him to resist than the others -- he hadn'tbeen trying as long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他还是回复到他以前的态度——尽可能地避开我——在他不需要暂时肩负起保护我的义务的时候。我知道这不是针对个人的，不过是为了以防万一，我也努力不要对此过于敏感。在坚持卡伦家的食谱方面，贾斯帕比他们其余的人遇到了更多的困难；与其他人相比，人类鲜血的气味对他而言难以抗拒得多——况且，他还没试多久。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll try." Alice let go of Jasper's hand and skipped forward, all her teeth sparkling in the bright light. Jasper smiled, too, but kept his distance.
