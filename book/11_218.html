<div class="line_en">They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side.</div>

<div class="line_en">Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds of mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandybucks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew and grew, and after his days continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很久以前，沼泽地或甚至是夏尔一带历史最悠久的老雄鹿家族，在家长葛和达—老雄鹿的带领之下，越过了烈酒河。烈酒河原先是哈比人东方领土的边界。他建造（和挖掘）了烈酒厅，将姓改为烈酒鹿，在此地定居下来，并且成为这个与世隔绝区域的首领。他的家族不停的扩张，在他死后依旧没有稍歇，最后，终于把整个山丘底下都给挤满了。光是这座山丘就有三个大门、许多个边门，一百多个窗户。烈酒鹿家人和难以记数的亲戚们接着开始往底下挖，稍后则是在旁边盖，形成了一个以雄鹿丘为中心的聚落。这就是雄鹿地的起源。这是一块夹在河边和老林之间，人口密集的狭长地带，可以被视作夏尔扩张的殖民地。它最大的村子则是巴寇伯理，位在烈酒厅后面的斜坡上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沼泽地的居民对雄鹿地的住民十分友善，烈酒厅之长（烈酒鹿家族家长的称号）的权威也受到史塔克和卢谢一带居民的认同。但大部分的夏尔居民都认为雄鹿地的家伙都怪里怪气的，几乎可以算是半个外国人。不过，事实上，他们和其它四区的人并没有多大的差别。唯一的不同是，他们喜欢船只，甚至有些人还会游泳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四名哈比人走下渡船。梅里负责将船系牢，皮聘领着小马往岸上走。此时，山姆（他正好往后看，似乎准备向夏尔道别）突然间用沙哑的声音低语道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many generations ago, and was now thick and tail, for it was constantly tended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in the Shire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起先他们的土地和东方来客之间没有任何的屏障；不过，稍后他们盖了一道篱笆：高篱，用来阻隔和保护自己。那是好几个世代以前建筑的防护，在经常的保养和加盖之下，目前已经变得又高又厚。它沿着烈酒桥一路过来，直到篱尾（也就是柳条河从森林里面流出，和烈酒河汇流的地方）：总共大概有二十哩长。不过，这当然不是滴水不漏的防护。很多地方的高篱都很靠近森林。因此，雄鹿地的居民在晚上都会锁上门，和夏尔的人没有多大的差别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="渡船缓缓的航过水上。雄鹿地的河岸越来越靠近。一行人中只有山姆以前从来没有渡过河。当河水潺潺流过脚下时，他有种奇异的感觉：往日的生活都已留在迷雾中，前方只有黑暗的冒险。他抓抓头，心中有些希望佛罗多先生可以一直在袋底洞终老。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind.

<div class="line_cn" title="在不远的对岸，昏黄的油灯照耀下，他们勉强可以看见一个黑色的身影站在码头上。当他们注视对方的时候，那人似乎在不停的左右移动和晃动着，好像在搜寻些什么。接着他趴了下去，或者是弯下腰，退回了油灯照不到的黑暗中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo's new house at Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the country.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从烈酒河到佛罗多在溪谷地的新家距离并不近。他们绕过雄鹿丘和烈酒厅，在巴寇伯理的郊外走上雄鹿地从桥往南走的主要干道。沿着这条路往北走了半哩左右，他们遇上了往右边的岔路。一行人右转走进这条岔路，在渺无人迹的荒野上又跋涉了几哩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们终于来到一堵厚重篱笆中的一扇小门前。它在外面草地和里面庭院的矮树包围中显得有些孤单。佛罗多选择这个住所是因为它位在不为人知的角落，附近没有其他的住家。你可以神不知鬼不觉的进进出出。这是很久以前烈酒鹿家为了招待客人所建造的；有时，想暂时躲避烈酒厅吵嚷生活的家人也会搬到这里暂住。这是老式的乡间小屋，尽可能的模仿哈比人住的洞穴。建筑本身又长又矮，没有加高的楼层。它有着干草铺成的屋顶、圆形的窗户和大大的圆门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们沿着小径走向大门时，庭院内没有任何的灯光。窗户紧闭，连百叶窗也拉了下来。佛罗多敲敲门，小胖博格前来应门；友善的灯火随着流泄而出。他们飞快的走进屋内，希望没有被任何人注意到。出现在他们眼前的是一个宽广的大厅，两边有着几扇门，中间则是一条贯穿整栋房屋的走廊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, what do you think of it?" asked Merry coming up the passage. "We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday."</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite things -- or Bilbo's things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling) -- were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very night, before they all went to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多四下打量着。这里看起来的确像老家。有很多他自己最喜欢的东西和比尔博的东西（这些东西搭配上新环境变得格外醒目）摆设在四周，梅里都尽量将它们照着袋底洞的布置来安排。这是个十分舒适、美丽、温馨的地方；让佛罗多有了种幻觉，彷佛自己真的是要在这边定居，享受退休生活。让老朋友为了这样一个烟幕付出这么多心力让他觉得实在惭愧；他更不知道该怎么对朋友表明自己必须立刻离开的真相。但，这件事不能再拖，一定要在所有人上床之前处理才行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have all been scared," said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak. "You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们全都很害怕，”佛罗多看着炉火一言不发，片刻之后才由皮聘开口。“如果你连续两天都被黑骑士紧追不舍，你也会害怕的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“骑着黑马的黑衣人，”皮聘回答。“佛罗多如果不愿意说，我就从头开始讲了。”他接着从他们离开哈比屯一路说到遇上梅里。山姆在其间有时点头，有时插嘴补充。佛罗多依旧沉默不语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I should think you were making it all up," said Merry, "if I had not seen that black shape on the landing-stage -- and heard the queer sound in Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cousin Frodo has been very close," said Pippin. "But the time has come for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot's guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo's treasure."</div>

But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think," answered Frodo slowly, "that it was a good guess, as far as it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo's old adventures, and the Riders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not safe here or anywhere else." He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way.

"Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: "Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder", and things like that.

<div class="line_en">"Oh no!" said Merry. "Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell you the truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever since he left. I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. We have been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so easily!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，没有啦！”梅里说。“这你就不用担心了！当然，这秘密也不可能隐藏太久。不过，目前的确只有我们这几个陰谋策划者知道。毕竟，我们已经认识你那么久，又经常和你玩在一起。我们这才猜的到你在想些什么。我也认识比尔博。说实话，从他离开之后，我就一直很注意你。我认为你迟早都会跟随他的脚步，我本来以为你会更早离开的；而近来的情势让我们更担心。我们很害怕你会和他一样神秘兮兮的消失，突然间离开。从今年春天以来，我们就对你紧迫盯人，也做了一些特别的安排。这次你要脱逃可没这么简单了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我最亲爱、最体贴的哈比朋友，”佛罗多极度感动的说。“可是我不能这么做。我很久以前就决定了。你们只知道危险，但你们不明白这有多危险。这不是去找宝藏的任务，更不是轻松来回的冒险。我为了躲避危机，而必须投入更大的危机。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, the Ring," said Merry. "My dear old hobbit, you don't allow for the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring for years -- before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful -- but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，魔戒，”梅里说。“我亲爱的哈比朋友，你太低估了周遭朋友的好奇心。我已经知道魔戒的存在好多年了；事实上，在比尔博离开前我就知道了。但既然他把这当做秘密，我就把这消息藏在心底。直到我们开始构思这计划时才派上用场。当然，我对比尔博的认识没有像对你那么深。我那时太年轻了，而他也比你更小心；但这还是无法阻挡我的好奇心。如果你想要知道这背后的故事，我愿意和你分享。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Suddenly in the distance the S. -- B. s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping through into the road, after the S. -- B. s had passed, and was looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“至于第二个问题的答案，”梅里说，“我们在一小时之内就可以出发。我已经准备好一切必要的东西。对面的马房里面有六匹小马，所有的补给品和装备都已经打包好了；我们只需要把预先打包会坏的食物处理好，和准备一些额外的衣物即可。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不确定，”佛罗多回答道。“我担心那些黑骑士的动向，我很确定任何地方只要待太久就不安全，特别是在这个大家都知道我去向的地方。吉尔多也建议我一刻也不要等。但我很希望甘道夫能够及时赶到。连吉尔多听见甘道夫没有出现时都露出了担忧的表情。关键是在两个地方。黑骑士赶到巴寇伯理要花多久时间？我们能够多快出发？我看这可能要花不少时间准备。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"They could have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the Hall -- for they would not like the look of the Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“安不安全的关键在于你认为这些黑骑士找到你之后会怎么做，”梅里回答。“如果他们没有在北门，也就是高篱和河交会的地方被拦下来，他们现在可能就已经到了这里。守卫不可能晚上开门让他们通过，但他们也有可能会硬闯。我想，即使在白天他们可能也不会让这些骑士进来，因为他们绝不可能对这些骑士的外表不起疑，也一定会感到不安。至少，他们会送口信到烈酒厅主人的耳中。不过，雄鹿地也无法长期抵抗对方的攻击。即使黑骑士登门寻找巴金斯先生，可能明早守卫也会放他们过去。毕竟大家都知道你已经回来在溪谷地定居了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo sat for a while in thought. "I have made up my mind," he said finally. "I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don't know how many there are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多坐着沉思了片刻。“我已经决定了，”他最后终于说。“我明天天一亮就出发。不过我不会走大路，那种明目张胆的方式恐怕比在这里等待还危险。如果我从北门离开，那么全雄鹿地就会知道我的行踪，而没办法让追兵至少有几天搞不清楚状况。不只如此，就算黑骑士进不了雄鹿地，烈酒桥和靠近边境的东方大路一定也有人监视。我们不知道到底有多少名黑骑士，但我们遇到了两名，可能还有更多。我们唯一的选择就是采取出奇不意的方向。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo's to help him in playing the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然小胖博格是佛罗多的好友，但他一点也不想离开夏尔，或是见识外面的大千世界。他的家族是来自夏尔东区，精确一点说，是大桥地的羊皮渡口。而且，他连烈酒桥都没有踏出去过。在原本的计划中，他就是要留下来，应付那些多嘴多舌的闲人，尽可能让大家以为佛罗多先生还居住在溪谷地。他甚至还带了些佛罗多的旧衣服来协助自己假扮对方。他们压根没想到这会是多危险的任务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes they do!" said Merry. "The Brandybucks go in -- occasionally when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“才不呢！”梅里说。“烈酒鹿家人只要心情好，就会进去晃晃。我们有自己的入口。佛罗多很久以前也进去过一次。我自己进去过几次，当然，通常是在白天，树木昏昏欲睡，不敢蠢动的时候。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, do as you think best!" said Fredegar. "I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long."</div>

<div class="line_en">When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Excellent!" said Frodo, when he understood the plan. "We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don't know whether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了！”当佛罗多了解整个计划之后，他不禁说。“反正我们也没别的办法留口信给甘道夫。当然，我也不确定黑骑士识不识字，但我可不敢冒险把消息写下来，一旦被他们搜到就糟糕了。不过，既然小胖愿意留下来，那甘道夫就有办法知道我们的行踪。这让我终于下定决心：我们明天一早就进老林。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of thunder.</div>
