<div class="line_en">We were in a brightly lit, unremarkable hallway. The walls were off-white, the floor carpeted in industrial gray. Common rectangular fluorescent lights were spaced evenly along the ceiling. It was warmer here, for which I was grateful. This hall seemed very benign after the gloom of the ghoulish stone sewers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们来到一条明亮的、普通的走廊。两边的墙壁是白色的，地板是灰色的。天花板上均匀地挂着很平常的矩形煤油灯。这个地方暖和些，我感到很开心，在走过阴森的下水道后感觉这个大厅尤其温馨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jane waited by the elevator, one hand holding the doors open for us. Her expression was apathetic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简等在电梯旁，一只手扶着门，她面无表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward didn't seem to agree with my assessment. He glowered darkly down the long hallway, toward the slight, black shrouded figure at the end, standing by an elevator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华的感受似乎和我很不一样。他眉头紧锁，看着长长的走廊，走廊尽头的电梯口似乎站着一身黑色的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once inside the elevator, the three vampires that belonged to the Volturi relaxed further. They threw back their cloaks, letting the hoods fall back on their shoulders. Felix and Demetri were both of a slightly olive complexion -- it looked odd combined with their chalky pallor. Felix's black hair was cropped short, but Demetri's waved to his shoulders. Their irises were deep crimson around the edges, darkening until they were black around the pupil. Under the shrouds, their clothes were modern, pale, and nondescript. I cowered in the corner, cringing against Edward. His hand still rubbed against my arm. He never took his eyes off Jane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进了电梯后，那三个沃尔图里的吸血鬼更加没有顾忌了。他们拿掉斗篷，把帽子留在肩上。费力克斯和德米特里的肤色都有点儿橄榄绿——和整体粉笔般的苍白很不协调。费力克斯的黑头发减得很短，但是德米特里的头发却长及肩膀。他们的眼膜周边鲜红，越往中央越黑，到了眼珠子那里已经是漆黑的了。他们的斗篷里面的衣服是现代的、苍白的，说不上有什么特色。我蜷缩在角落，紧紧靠着爱德华，他的手依然在我手臂上搓着，他的双眼死死地盯着简。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He pulled me along, and Alice walked on my other side. The heavy door creaked shut behind us, and then there was the thud of a bolt sliding home.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of the room was a high, polished mahogany counter. I gawked in astonishment at the woman behind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间的中间是一个高高的、光泽的桃花心木柜台，我惊奇地看着柜台上的女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no surprise in her face as she glanced at Jane's company. Not Edward, his bare chest glinting dimly in the white lights, or even me, disheveled and comparatively hideous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到和简一起的这班人她一点也不惊奇。就算看到爱德华袒露的胸膛在白色的光线下微微发光，还有我蓬头垢面，狼狈不堪的样子，她也毫不奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The elevator ride was short; we stepped out into what looked like a posh office reception area. The walls were paneled in wood, the floors carpeted in thick, deep green. There were no windows, but large, brightly lit paintings of the Tuscan countryside hung everywhere as replacements. Pale leather couches were arranged in cozy groupings, and the glossy tables held crystal vases full of vibrantly colored bouquets. The flowers' smell reminded me of a funeral home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们乘电梯时间很短，走出电梯，来到一个像是邮局前台的地方。墙壁是木头做成的，地板是很深很深的蓝色。没有窗户，取而代之的是大幅的色彩鲜艳的托斯卡纳风格的乡村风景画。白色的皮沙发整齐地摆放着，光滑的桌面上摆着水晶花瓶，插满了艳丽的花束，这些花的香气使我联想到殡仪馆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was tall, with dark skin and green eyes. She would have been very pretty in any other company -- but not here. Because she was every bit as human as I was. I couldn't comprehend what this human woman was doing here, totally at ease, surrounded by vampnes.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“亚力克。”简回应他，拥抱那个男孩儿，互相亲吻对方的脸颊，然后他看着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other side of the wooden doors was a different kind of reception. The pale boy in the pearl gray suit could have been Jane's twin. His hair was darker, and his lips were not as full, but he was just as lovely. He came forward to meet us. He smiled, reaching for her. "Jane."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木门的后面的接待处和前面的那个完全不一样，有个穿着白珍珠颜色西装的男孩儿看起来像简的双胞胎兄弟。他的头发比简黑，嘴唇没有简饱满，但是同样那么讨人喜爱。他迎上来，微笑地和简打招呼：“简。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They exchanged a long glance, and I wished I could hear what she was telling him. I figured that it was something to do with not attacking Felix, because Edward took a deep breath and turned back to Alec.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们交换了一个眼神，我真希望自己能听见她对他说了什么。我猜大概是让爱德华不要出手打费力克斯，因为爱德华深吸一口气，然后转向亚力克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They ignored the doors at the end of the hall -- doors entirely sheathed in gold -- stopping halfway down the hall and sliding aside a piece of the paneling to expose a plain wooden door. It wasn't locked. Alec held it open for Jane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走过大厅尽头的几扇门——这几扇门完全镀了一层金——在大厅中间停下，拉开一块嵌板，露出一扇普通的木门。这门没上锁，亚力克推开门让简过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The stone antechamber was not large. It opened quickly into a brighter, cavernous room, perfectly round like a huge castle turret… which was probably exactly what it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石头砌成的接待室不大。很快我们就来到一个亮堂些，洞穴般的房间，圆圆的像极了一座城堡的大灯塔……可能它就是座灯塔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to groan when Edward pulled me through to the other side of the door. It was the same ancient stone as the square, the alley, and the sewers. And it was dark and cold again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华把我推过门的时候，我都快呻吟了。和广场、小巷、下水道一样，又是一些古老的石头，又变得又冷又暗了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was not empty. A handful of people were convened in seemingly relaxed conversation. The murmur of low, smooth voices was a gentle hum in the air. As I watched, a pair of pale women in summer dresses paused in a patch of light, and, like prisms, their skin threw the light in rainbow sparkles against the sienna walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这房间不是空着的，有几个人好像正在轻松地开会讨论什么，他们低沉、平淡的声音在空气中嗡嗡作响。我正看着，两个穿着夏装的女人停在一束光中，她们的皮肤像棱镜一样，把阳光反射到黄色的墙上，像彩虹般色彩斑斓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two stories up, long window slits threw thin rectangles of bright sunlight onto the stone floor below. There were no artificial lights. The only furniture in the room were several massive wooden chairs, like thrones, that were spaced unevenly, flush with the curving stone walls. In the very center of the circle, in a slight depression, was another drain. I wondered if they used it as an exit, like the hole in the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往上两层楼，两道阳光从长长的窗户射到石板地面上，没有其他的光源。房间里仅有的家具就是几张很大的木椅，像君主的宝座，毫无秩序地摆在那里，和弯弯绕绕的石墙相互反光。在圆圈的中间，光线很暗，又是一个排水道。我猜想他们是不是把它当成一个出口。就像街上的洞那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was only more astonished as he floated closer and I could see his face. It was not like the unnaturally attractive faces that surrounded him (for he did not approach us alone; the entire group converged around him, some following, and some walking ahead of him with the alert manner of bodyguards). I couldn't decide if his face was beautiful or not. I suppose the features were perfect. But he was as different from the vampires beside him as they were from me. His skin was translucently white, like onionskin, and it looked just as delicate -- it stood in shocking contrast to the long black hair that framed his face. I felt a strange, horrifying urge to touch his cheek, to see if it was softer than Edward's or Alice's, or if it was powdery, like chalk. His eyes were red, the same as the others around him, but the color was clouded, milky; I wondered if his vision was affected by the haze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他飘得更近了，看到了他的脸，我更是惊呆了。他那迷人的脸不像其他人那样美得不自然（因为不仅仅他走进我们，所有人围绕着他，有些跟在后面，有些像保镖似的警觉地走在前方）。我说不清楚他的脸是不是很美丽，我认为五官长得很完美，但是和我一样，他长得和他身边的吸血鬼不一样。他的皮肤白得透明，像洋葱的皮，看起来也非常精致——这张脸镶嵌在他那头乌黑的头发衬托出的轮廓中显得异常突出。我突然有种奇怪、可怕的冲动，我想摸摸他的脸，看看是不是比爱德华或爱丽丝的脸柔软，还是像粉笔那样粗糙。他的眼睛和其他人一样是红色的，但是红色上面有朦朦胧胧的薄膜，我怀疑他的视力会不会受这个影响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drifted forward, and the movement flowed with such surreal grace that I gawked, my mouth hangmg open. Even Alice, whose every motion looked like dancing, could not compare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他轻快地走过来，那动作是如此的优雅，显得不真实，我看傻了眼，嘴巴张得大大的，即使是举手投足都像是在跳舞的爱丽丝也望尘莫及。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jane, dear one, you've returned!" he cried in evident delight. His voice was just a soft sighing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The exquisite faces all turned toward our party as we entered the room. Most of the immortals were dressed in inconspicuous pants and shirts -- things that wouldn't stick out at all on the streets below. But the man who spoke first wore one of the long robes. It was pitch-black, and brushed against the floor. For a moment, I thought his long, jet-black hair was the hood of his cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一走进房间，那些尊贵的脸孔都转过来。大部分的吸血鬼都穿着普通的裤子和衬衫，在街上不会被认出来，但是第一个说话的人穿着长袍，长袍很黑，拖地的长度。一开始，我还以为他那很长的黑发是他斗篷的头巾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很抱歉，我们还没有正式地相互认识吧？只是我觉得自己已经和你认识了，我这人意识有点超前。你的兄弟昨天和我说过你，他从很意外的方式介绍了你。你看，我和你兄弟的能力相当，只是我比他多一些限制。”阿罗无奈地摇了摇头，语气中透露出嫉妒之情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I'm far from infallible." She flashed a dazzling smile. She looked perfectly at ease, except that her hands were balled into tight little fists. "As you can see today, I cause problems as often as I cure them."</div>
