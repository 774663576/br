<div class="line_en">Harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest Thestral, placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily on to the horse's silken back. It did not object, but twisted its head around, fangs bared, and attempted to continue its eager licking of his robes.</div>

<div class="line_en">He found there was a way of lodging his knees behind the wing joints that made him feel more secure, then looked around at the others. Neville had heaved himself over the back of the next Thestral and was now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature's back. Luna was already in place, sitting side-saddle and adjusting her robes as though she did this every day.

<div class="line_en">For a moment Harry's Thestral did nothing at all; then, with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him, the wings on either side extended; the horse crouched slowly, then rocketed upwards so fast and so steeply that Harry had to clench his arms and legs tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backwards over its bony rump. He closed his eyes and pressed his face down into the horses silky mane as they burst through the topmost branches of the trees and soared out into a blood-red sunset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那匹夜骐纹丝不动地站了一会儿；然后突然展开双翼，动作大得差一点把哈利甩下去；它先慢慢地蹲伏下来，随后箭一般地向天空冲去，速度之快，角度之陡，令哈利不得不手脚并用紧紧抱住它的身躯，以免从它瘦骨嶙峋的尾部滑落下来。他们冲过树梢，飞向火红的夕阳，他紧闭双眼，把脸颊紧贴在夜骐光滑如丝的鬃毛上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were over the Hogwarts grounds, they had passed Hogsmeade; Harry could see mountains and gullies below them. As the daylight began to fail, Harry saw small collections of lights as they passed over more villages, then a winding road on which a single car was beetling its way home through the hills…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们飞越霍格沃茨的场地，掠过霍格莫德上空；哈利能看到下面的群山和溪谷。白昼开始隐去，他们飞过一个又一个村庄，哈利看到了星罗棋布的灯光，接着是一辆孤零零的小汽车在归途中沿着弯弯曲曲的盘山路飞速穿越一座座小丘…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry did not think he had ever moved so fast: the Thestral streaked over the castle, its wide wings hardly beating; the cooling air was slapping Harry's face; eyes screwed up against the rushing wind, he looked round and saw his five fellows soaring along behind him, each of them bent as low as possible into the neck of their Thestral to protect themselves from his slipstream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利从没想到自己会飞得这样快。夜骐从城堡上空急速掠过，宽大的双翼有力地挥动着；冰凉的气流拍打在哈利的脸上；他顶着疾风眯紧眼睛，扭头看到五个伙伴们正跟着他飞翔，为了避开他卷起的尾流，他们一个个都尽可能地弯下身子躲在夜骐的脖子后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is bizarre!" Harry barely heard Ron yell from somewhere behind him, and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible means of support.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太奇特了！”哈利勉强听到罗恩的叫喊声从后面什么地方传来，心里想象着在这么高的空中疾驰，又看不到自己的坐骑会是什么样的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Twilight fell: the sky was turning to a light, dusky purple littered with tiny silver stars, and soon only the lights of Muggle towns gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were, or how very fast they were travelling. Harry's arms were wrapped tightly around his horse's neck as he willed it to go even faster. How much time had elapsed since he had seen Sirius lying on the Department of Mysteries floor? How much longer would Sirius be able to resist Voldemort? All Harry knew for sure was that his godfather had neither done as Voldemort wanted, nor died, for he was convinced that either outcome would have caused him to feel Voldemort's jubilation or fury course through his own body, making his scar sear as painfully as it had on the night Mr. Weasley was attacked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暮色降临：天空渐渐呈现出淡淡的、朦胧的紫色，散落着一颗颗银光闪闪的小星星。很快，只有麻瓜城镇的灯光才能让他们知道自己离地面有多高，速度有多快。哈利的胳膊缠绕着马脖子，搂得紧紧的，想要它飞得更快些。自从他看到小天狼星躺在神秘事务司的地板上那一刻起到现在已经流逝了多少时间？小天狼星抵御伏地魔还能坚持多久？哈利只能断定，他的教父既没有顺从伏地魔的命令，也没有被害，因为他确信，不管是哪种结果，都会让他感到伏地魔的喜悦或愤怒在自己的身体中流过，让他的伤疤灼痛得就像韦斯莱先生遭袭的那个夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On they flew through the gathering darkness; Harry's face felt stiff and cold, his legs numb from gripping the Thestral's sides so tightly, but he did not dare shift his position lest he slip… he was deaf from the thundering rush of air in his ears, and his mouth was dry and frozen from the cold night wind. He had lost all sense of how far they had come; all his faith was in the beast beneath him, still streaking purposefully through the night, barely flapping its wings as it sped ever onwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在一片黑暗中飞行；哈利觉得自己的脸僵硬、冰冷，紧紧夹在夜骐两侧的双腿也麻木了，但他不敢调换姿势，惟恐滑落下去…他什么也听不到，只有隆隆的气流在耳边疾驰，嘴巴被冰冷的夜风吹干了，冻僵了。他们究竟走了多远，他对此已经没有意识；他的希望全部寄托在身下的夜骐上，它仍在坚定地飞速穿越漆黑的夜空，向前飞行时几乎从不拍打双翼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's stomach gave a jolt; the Thestral's head was suddenly pointing towards the ground and he actually slid forwards a few inches along its neck. They were descending at last… he thought he heard a shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously, but could see no sign of a falling body… presumably they had all received a shock from the change of direction, just as he had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的肚子震动了一下；夜骐的脑袋突然俯向地面，他顺着它的脖子向前滑动了几英寸。他们终于要着陆了…他似乎听到背后有一声尖叫，于是紧张地扭过头去，没有看到正在坠落的躯体…大概他们也都像他一样，在改变方向的时候吃了一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now bright orange lights were growing larger and rounder on all sides; they could see the tops of buildings, streams of headlights like luminous insect eyes, squares of pale yellow that were windows. Quite suddenly, it seemed, they were hurtling towards the pavement; Harry gripped the Thestral with every last ounce of his strength, braced for a sudden impact, but the horse touched the dark ground as lightly as a shadow and Harry slid from its back, looking around at the street where the overflowing skip still stood a short way from the vandalised telephone box, both drained of colour in the flat orange glare of the streetlights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四周明亮的橘黄色灯光变得越来越大，越来越圆；他们可以看到建筑物的房顶，车流的前灯灯光就像是甲虫闪亮的眼睛，四四方方的窗户透出暗淡的黄色光芒。猛然间，他们好像在朝人行道冲去；哈利竭尽全力，拼命抓住夜骐，准备应付突然着地时的撞击。然而夜骐像影子一样，轻盈地落在黑黢黢的地面上。哈利从它背上滑下来，环视了一眼这条街道，那辆满得快要溢出来的翻斗车仍然停在离破旧的电话亭不远的地方，在单调的橘黄色街灯的照射下，看不清它们本来的颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never again," he said, struggling to his feet. He made as though to stride away from his Thestral, but, unable to see it, collided with its hindquarters and almost fell over again. Never, ever again… that was the worst --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不想再来一次。”他说，挣扎着站起来。他似乎想要大步离开夜骐，可他看不到它，所以撞到了它的后腿上，又差一点仰面倒下去。“绝对，绝对不能再来一次…这就够糟了——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ron landed a short way off and toppled immediately from his Thestral on to the pavement.</div>

<div class="line_en">A chink of soft golden light hit their feet and, widening, rose up their bodies. Harry bent his knees and held his wand as ready as he could in such cramped conditions as he peered through the glass to see whether anybody was waiting for them in the Atrium, but it seemed, to be completely empty. The light was dimmer than it had been by day; there were no fires burning under the mantelpieces set into the walls, but as the lift slid smoothly to a halt he saw that golden symbols continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一道细细的金色光线照射在他们的脚上，越来越宽，移到了他们的身上。在如此狭窄的空间里，哈利抓着魔杖，尽可能蹲下来透过玻璃注视着外面，看看是不是有人正在正厅等着他们，但是正厅好像空无一人。光线比白天要暗一些；镶嵌在墙上的壁炉架里没有生火，但是当升降梯平稳地停下来时，他看到在深蓝色的顶篷上，那个金色符号仍在不停地无规则地扭动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins normally appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny's head; he glanced at the topmost one, Harry Potter, Rescue Mission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六枚徽章从应该用来退出硬币的金属斜糟里滑了出来。赫敏捧起它们，一声不响地越过金妮头顶递给哈利；哈利看了一眼最上面的一个：哈利．波特，援救任务。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past its glass windows; the scavenging Thestrals were sliding out of sight; blackness closed over their heads and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depths of the Ministry of Magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电话亭的地面突然晃动起来，外面的人行道逐渐升高没过了窗子，正在觅食的夜骐慢慢滑出了视线；黑暗在他们的头顶合拢了，伴着枯燥的磨擦声，他们下到了魔法部的深处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“过来。”哈利轻轻地说，六个人在大厅里全速跑着，他在最前面经过喷泉朝安检台跑去，那里曾坐着一个给哈利豹魔杖称重的巫师看守，可现在那里空无一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry felt sure there ought to be a security person there, sure their absence was an ominous sign, and his feeling of foreboding increased as they passed through the golden gates to the lifts. He pressed the nearest "down" button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately, the golden grilles slid apart with a great, echoing clanking and they dashed inside. Harry stabbed the number nine button; the grilles closed with a bang and the lift began to descend, jangling and rattling. Harry had not realised how noisy the lifts were on the day he had come with Mr. Weasley; he was sure the din would raise every security person within the building, yet when the lilt halted, the cool female voice said, "Department of Mysteries," and the grilles slid open. They stepped out into the corridor where nothing was moving out but the nearest torches, flickering in the rush of air from the lift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利认为这里是应该有保安人员的，并相信没有人把门是个不祥的兆头。当他们穿过黄金大门走向升降梯时，他的这种不祥预感更加强烈了。他按下最近处的一个“向下”按钮，升降梯几乎立刻咔哒一下出现在跟前，金色的栅栏从中闯滑到两边，发出震耳的、回荡的铿锵声，他们冲了进去。哈利戳了一下九号按钮，栅栏砰的一声关上了。升降梯发出咔哒咔哒的响声，很是刺耳，哈利在那天白天随韦斯莱先生来这里时并没有注意到它这么吵。他相信这样的噪音一定能引起建筑物里每一个保安人员的注意。然而当升降梯停下来时，那个冷漠的女人的声音说道：“神秘事务司。”栅栏打开了，他们走出来进入走廊，这里除了最近处的火把在升降梯搅起的气流中摇曳闪烁之外，什么动静也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door of the telephone box burst open; Harry toppled out of it, closely followed by Neville and Luna. The only sound in the Atrium was the steady rush of water from the golden fountain, where jets from the wands of the witch and wizard, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat and the house-elf's ears continued to gush into the surrounding pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电话亭的门猛地打开了，哈利一个趔趄冲了出来，紧跟着的是纳威和卢娜。正厅里惟一能听到的声音就是黄金喷泉中持续的疾流声，水流从男女巫师的魔杖里，马人的箭头上，妖精帽子尖上和家养小精灵的耳朵里不停地喷出，落在圆形水池中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his dream, Harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on. But there were around a dozen doors here. Just as he was gazing ahead at the doors opposite him, trying to decide which was the right one, there was a great rumbling noise and the candles began to move sideways. The circular wall was rotating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在哈利的梦里，他始终都是毫不犹豫地走过这问屋子，径直来到正对入口的那扇门前，然后又继续向前走去。可是现在周围有十二扇门。正当他凝视着面前的几扇门，想判定应该进哪一扇时，随着一声轰隆隆的巨响，蜡烛开始向一侧移动。圆形的墙壁旋转起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He regretted giving this order the moment Neville had obeyed it. Without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them, the place became so dark that for a moment the only things they could see were the bunches of shivering blue flames on the walls and their ghostly reflections in the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当纳威照他的话办了以后，他真后悔下了这个指令。没有了从身后走廊倾泻进来的那道狭长的光束，这个地方变得暗了，以至于在一段时间里他们只能看见墙上摇曳着的蓝色烛火以及它们在地板上映出的可怕倒影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hermione grabbed Harry's arm as though frightened the floor might move, too, but it did not. For a few seconds, the blue flames around them were blurred to resemble neon lines as the wall sped around; then, quite as suddenly as it had started, the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again.</div>

<div class="line_en">This room was larger than the last, dimly lit and rectangular, and the centre of it was sunken, forming a great stone pit some twenty feet deep. They were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone benches running all around the room and descending in steep steps like an amphitheatre, or the courtroom in which Harry had been tried by the Wizengamot. Instead, of a chained chair, however, there was a raised stone dais in the centre of the pit, on which stood a stone archway that looked so ancient, cracked and crumbling that Harry was amazed the thing was still standing. Unsupported by any surrounding wall, the archway was hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which, despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air, was fluttering very slightly as though it had just been touched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一问比刚才的那一问大一些，光线昏暗，呈方形，中心凹陷，形成一个巨大的石坑，大约有二十英尺深。石头台阶环绕着整个屋子，如同石凳，一级一级逐渐F降，每一级都很陡峭，就像是阶梯教室，或是哈利曾被威森加摩审问过的审判室，他们所站的位置处于最高一级台阶上。但石坑的中心没有放着带铁链的椅子，取而代之的是一个凸起的石台，它的上面立着一个拱门，看上去很古老，破烂不堪，哈利奇怪它居然还能立在那里不倒下来。拱门四周没有任何墙壁支撑，一幅破破烂烂的黑色窗帘抑或是帷幔挂在上面，尽管这里的空气冷冷的，没有一丝风，可它却在轻轻地摆动，仿佛是刚刚被人触摸过。">查看中文翻译</div>

Still the veil swayed gently, as though somebody had just passed through it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利快速逐层爬下石凳来到石坑最底部，然后慢慢走向石台，脚步声在屋子里回荡，这个尖顶的拱门现在看上去要比从上面俯视它时高得多。帷幔还在轻轻摆动，像是有人刚刚穿过它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It can't be, Harry could get through all the doors in his dream," said Hermione, marking the door with another fiery cross as Harry replaced the now-useless handle of Sirius's knife in his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不可能，哈利在他的梦里可以穿过所有的门。”赫敏说着在门上又做了个x，与此同时，哈利把已经报废的小天狼星的小刀刀柄放回了口袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew it at once by the beautiful, dancing, diamond-sparkling light. As Harry's eyes became accustomed to the brilliant glare, he saw clocks gleaming from every surface, large and small, grandfather and carriage, hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room, so that a busy, relentless ticking filled the place like thousands of minuscule, marching footsteps. The source of the dancing, diamond-bright light was a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他看到美丽的、钻石般闪烁的跳跃光芒时，立刻就认出正是这一间屋子。他的眼睛逐渐适应了这里灿烂夺目的光芒之后，才看清楚许许多多的钟表的表盘在闪着微光。它们大小不一，有落地大座钟也有旅行钟，或是悬挂在书架之间，或是立在有整个屋子那么长的桌子上。正因为如此，一种急促的永无休止的嘀答声充满了整个屋子，像是成千上万细微的脚步声。那道钻石般明亮的跳跃光芒来自房间尽头一个高高耸立着的钟形水晶玻璃罩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know what could be in there?" said Luna eagerly, as the wall started to spin yet again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们觉得那里面可能有什么呢？”卢娜热切地问道，这时候墙壁又开始转动了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wall slid to a halt and Harry, with a feeling of increasing desperation, pushed the next door open.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's heart was pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track; he led the way down the narrow space between the lines of desks, heading, as he had done in his dream, for the source of the light, the crystal bell jar quite as tall as he was that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing, glittering wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦知道他们走的路线是正确的，哈利的心就猛烈地跳动起来。他走在前面，顺着桌子之间狭窄的空隙走向光源，就像他在梦里所做的一样。这个钟形的水晶玻璃罩有哈利那么高，立在一张桌子上，看上去里面充满了一股翻腾着的、闪闪发光的气流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, look!" said Ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，看呀！”当他们走近时，金妮指着钟形玻璃罩的中心说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这边走！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keep going!" said Harry sharply, because Ginny showed signs of wanting to stop and watch the egg's progress back into a bird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“继续走，别停下！”哈利厉声说，因为金妮好像很想停下来观察蛋变成鸟的过程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You dawdled enough by that old arch!" she said crossly, but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你倒是在老拱门那儿待够了！”她顶了一句，但还是跟在他的后面，经过钟形水晶玻璃罩走向它后面仅有的一扇门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Drifting along in the sparkling current inside was a tiny, jewel-bright egg. As it rose in the jar, it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged, which was carried to the very top of the jar, but as it fell on the draught its feathers became bedraggled and damp again, and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in its egg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在闪烁的光线中，飘浮着一个小小的像宝石一般明亮的蛋。当它在玻璃罩里升起来的时候，啪的一下裂开了，一只蜂鸟冒出来，径直升到玻璃罩的最顶部，但随着气流的下落，小鸟的羽毛被再次弄脏、淋湿，直到降落到玻璃罩的最底部，被再次关进蛋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这儿。”哈利又说了一遍。他心跳得厉害，他想一定是心跳影响了他的语言表达，“它是穿过这里——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah," breathed Harry, looking up at the end of the closest row. Beneath the branch of blue-glowing candles protruding from it glimmered the silver figure fifty-three.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”哈利轻声回应，抬头朝最近一排的尽头望去。蜡烛发出蓝色的火苗，支架下面闪烁着银色的数字53。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were there, they had found the place: high as a church and full of nothing but towering shelves covered in small, dusty glass orbs. They glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle-brackets set at intervals along the shelves. Like those in the circular room behind them, their flames were burning blue. The room was very cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们来到了里面，他们终于找到了这个地方。这里像教堂一样高，里面排满高耸的架子，上面摆满灰扑扑的小玻璃球，除此之外什么也没有。更多的烛台隔着一定的间隔嵌在架子上，暗淡的光线从上面射出来，同那问黑色圆形屋子里的一样，火苗是蓝色的。那些小玻璃球在这些光线中隐隐发光。房子里面很冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisles between two rows of shelves. He could not hear anything or see the slightest sign of movement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利慢慢走向前，低头审视了一眼两排架子之间的一条阴暗的过道，他听不到一丝声音，也感觉不到动静，哪怕是最微小的动静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你说过是第97排。”赫敏在他旁边悄悄地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They crept forward, glancing behind them as they went on down the long alleys of shelves, the further ends of which were in near-total darkness. Tiny, yellowing labels had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelves. Some of them had a weird, liquid glow; others were as dull and dark within as blown light bulbs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们蹑手蹑脚地沿着架子之间长长的过道朝前走去，不时回头瞥瞥身后，远处几乎是一片漆黑。每个玻璃球下面的架子上都贴着泛黄的小标签。一些小球发出神秘的流动的光，另外一些则模糊而黑暗，就像熄灭了的灯泡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not want to hear what Ron had to say; did not want to hear Ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to Hogwarts, but the heat was rising in his face and he felt as though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the Atrium above and the others' accusing stares…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不想听罗恩说话；不想听罗恩说他很蠢，或者是建议他们应该回到霍格沃茨去，但是他的脸越来越火辣辣的，好像自己想在面对高高的明亮的正厅和其他责备的目光之前，偷偷地在这里的黑暗中躲藏一段时间…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stepped forwards. Not as tall as Ron, he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously, and below that:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走上前，因为不如罗恩高，他不得不伸直了脖子去看贴在架子上的玻璃球下面的泛黄的标签。上面用精巧的字体标着一个大约是十六年以前的一个日期，接下来是：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" said Harry, but eagerly this time -- it had to be a sign that Sirius had been there, a clue. He strode back to where they were all standing, a little way down row ninety-seven, but found nothing except Ron staring at one of the dusty glass spheres on the shelf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”哈利问，他这次的语气很急切——一定是小天狼星曾在这里待过的痕迹或线索。其他人都站在第97排架子尽头靠向里一点的地方，他大步走到他们跟前，什么也没有发现，只是看见罗恩正在注视着架子上的一个脏兮兮的玻璃球。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty ball's surface. He had expected it to feel cold, but it did not. On the contrary, it felt as though it had been lying in the sun for hours, as though the glow of light within was warming it. Expecting, even hoping, that something dramatic was going to happen, something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worth while after all, Harry lifted the glass ball down from its shelf and stared at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他心想管他呢，豁出去了，于是他握住了那个肮脏的小球。他原以为它是冰凉的，但是正相反，它让人觉得它好像已经在阳光下放了几个小时，好像被它自身的光芒温暖着。哈利期待着，甚至是希望有什么戏剧性的事情会发生，希望有一些令人兴奋的东西可以令他们这漫长且危机四伏的旅行最终有些价值，他把这个玻璃球从架子上取了下来，瞪眼看着它。">查看中文翻译</div>
