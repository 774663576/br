<div class="line_en">They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her. To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared for-and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe. "Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively." They were laying themselves open to that very phrase-and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her heart. She still intended him for her friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等大家都坐下后，情况有了好转。在爱玛看来，情况好多了，因为弗兰克·邱吉尔变得健谈了，来了兴致，把她作为首要目标。他竭力把心思都花在她身上，似乎一心就逗她高兴，讨她喜欢——而爱玛正想活跃一下，听一听对她的奉承，于是也变得快活、随和起来，给了他友好的鼓励，听任他献殷勤。在最初交往的日子里，两人关系最热烈的时候，她曾鼓励过他、听任他。可是现在，她认为她这样做已经毫无意义，不过在大多数旁观者看来，他们的所作所为最好用“调情”两字来形容。“弗兰克·邱吉尔先生和伍德豪斯小姐调情调过头了。”他们受到了这样的非议——一位女士写信把这事传到了枫园，另一位女士写信这事传到了爱尔兰。其实，爱玛并不是真的快活得忘乎所以，恰恰相反，她觉得自己并不快活。她因为失望而放声大笑。虽说她喜欢他献殷勤，认为这种殷勤不管是出于友谊、爱慕还是逢场作戏，都是十分妥当的，但是已经无法赢回她那颗心了。她仍然希望他做她的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing -- looked without seeing-admired without intelligence-listened without knowing what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛从一开始就意兴索然。她从未见过弗兰克·邱吉尔如此沉闷，如此迟钝，他的话没有一句值得一听——两眼视而不见——赞叹起来不知所云——听人说话又不知对方说些什么。他如此沉闷，也就难怪哈丽特会同样沉闷。他们两人真叫爱玛难以忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing: --"How well they suit one another! -- Very lucky-marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place! -- They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky! -- for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give-it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment.

<div class="line_en">They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she hoped never to be betrayed into again.</div>

Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation -- but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her-and before her niece, too-and before others, many of whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided by your treatment of her. -- This is not pleasant to you, Emma-and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will, -- I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now."</div>

<div class="line_en">While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself, mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome-then reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and the horses were in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed-almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no denying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!</div>
