<div class="line_en">It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in BerkeleyStreet, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of hiswife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feelit necessary to pay her a visit. -- This was an obligation, however, which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not theassistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, notcontented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent toprevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though hercarriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked afterthe late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by takingEdward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her companyagain. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay avisit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to runthe risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others hadso much reason to dislike.</div>

After a few moments'chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of hersister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor wasleft to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gayunconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying sounfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the prejudiceof his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course oflife, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her mostunfavourable opinion of his head and heart.</div>

That was what I said immediately. -- I was most uncommonlyshocked, indeed! -- Poor Edward! -- he has done for himselfcompletely-shut himself out for ever from all decent society! -- but, asI directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be expected. My poormother was half frantic."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可以把这当作玩笑，”他终于止住了笑声，说道。其实，真正没有那么多好乐的，他只不过想要矫揉造作地多笑一阵子罢了。“不过，说句真心话，这是一件极其严肃的事情。可怜的爱德华！他水远被毁灭了。我感到万分惋惜，因为我知道他是个好心人，也许是个心肠比谁都好的人。达什伍德小姐，你不能凭着你和他的泛泛之交，就对他妄下结论。可怜的爱德华！他的言谈举止当然不是最讨人喜欢的。不过你知道，我们大家生下来并不是样样能力一般齐——言谈举止也不一致。可怜的家伙！你若是见他和一伙生人在一起，那可真够可怜的！不过，说句良心话，我相信他有一副好心肠，好得不亚于王国的任何人。说实在的，这事猛然一出来，我生平从没那么震惊过。我简直不敢相信。我母亲第一个把这件事告诉了我，我觉得她是求我采取果断行动，于是我立即对她说：‘亲爱的母亲，我不知道你在这个关头会打算怎么办，但是就我而论，我要说，如果爱德华真的娶了这个年轻女人，那我决不要再见到他。’这就是我当时说的话。的确，我这一惊吃得非同小可！可怜的爱德华！他完全把自己葬送了！永远把自己排除在上流社会之外！不过，正如我立即向我母亲说的，我对此一点也不感到惊讶。从他所受的教育方式看，他总要出这种事的。我可怜的母亲简直有点发疯了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop infor ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkwardcountry girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. -- I remember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should supposelikely to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as mymother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuadehim from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of ittill after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, youknow, to interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hoursearlier-I think it is most probable-that something might have beenhit on. I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a verystrong light. 'My dear fellow,' I should have said, 'consider what youare doing. You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such aone as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot helpthinking, in short, that means might have been found. But now it isall too late. He must be starved, you know; -- that is certain; absolutely starved."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，见过一次，当她呆在这座房子里的时候。我偶然进来逗留了十分钟，把她好好看了看。只不过是个别别扭扭的乡下姑娘，既不风流，也不漂亮。我还清清楚楚地记得她。我想她就是可以迷住可怜的爱德华的那种姑娘。我母亲把事情对我一说，我就立即提出要亲自和他谈谈，说服他放弃这门婚事。但是我发现，当时已经为时过晚，无法挽救了。因为不幸的是，我一开始不在家，直到关系破裂之后，我才知道这件事，不过你知道，这时候我已经无法干预了。我若是早得知几个小时的话，我想十有八九是可以想出办法来的。我势必会极力向爱德华陈说的。‘我的好伙计，’我会说，‘考虑一下你这是在做什么。你在谋求一桩极不体面的婚事，遭到了你一家人的一致反对。’总之一句话，我认为当时是有办法的。但是现在太晚了。你知道，他肯定要挨饿，这是确定无疑的，绝对要挨饿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entranceof Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though SHE neverspoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence onher mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which sheentered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself. Sheeven proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and hersister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more ofthem; -- an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into theroom, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish everything that was most affectionate and graceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗伯特刚刚泰然自若地说完这一点，约翰。达什伍德夫人走了进来，打断了这个话题。不过，虽然她从不同外人谈论这件事，可埃丽诺还是看得出来这件事给她精神上带来的影响：她才进来时，神气就有点慌乱，后来又试图对埃丽诺表现得热诚些。当她发现埃丽诺和她妹妹很快就要离开城里时，她甚至还表示关切，好像她一直希望能多见见她们。她一面在说，陪她一起进来的丈夫一面在洗耳恭听，好像哪里说得最富有感情，哪里说得最温文尔雅，他都能辨别得一清二楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
