<div class="line_en">Until two days ago, Lindy Gardner was my next-door neighbour. Okay, you're thinking, if Lindy Gardner was my neighbour, that probably means I live in Beverly Hills; a movie producer, maybe, or an actor or a musician. Well, I'm a musician all right. But though I've played behind one or two performers you'll have heard of, I'm not what you'd call big-league. My manager, Bradley Stevenson, who in his way has been a good friend over the years, maintains I have it in me to be big-league. Not just big-league session player, but big-league headliner. It's not true saxophonists don't become headliners any more, he says, and repeats his list of names. Marcus Lightfoot. Silvio Tarrentini. They're all jazz players, I point out. "What are you, if you're not a jazz player?" he says. But only in my innermost dreams am I still a jazz player. In the real world -- when I don't have my face entirely wrapped in bandages the way I do now -- I'm just a jobbing tenor man, in reasonable demand for studio work, or when a band's lost their regular guy. If it's pop they want, it's pop I play. R&amp;B? Fine. Car commercials, the walk-on theme for a talk show, I'll do it. I'm a jazz player these days only when I'm inside my cubicle.</div>

<div class="line_en">You've guessed by now Lindy Gardner never lived next to this apartment I'm talking about. Neither was she one of the neighbors who banged the door whenever I played outside the cubicle. When I said she was my neighbour, I meant something else, and I'm going to explain this right now.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd prefer to play in my living room, but our apartment's so cheaply made the neighbours would start complaining all the way down the hall. So what I've done is convert our smallest room into a rehearsal room. It's no more than a closet really -- you can get an office chair in there and that's it -- but I've sound-proofed it with foam and egg-trays and old padded envelopes my manager Bradley sent round from his office. Helen, my wife, when she used to live with me, she'd see me going in there with my sax and she'd laugh and say it was like I was going to the toilet, and sometimes that's how it felt. That's to say, it was like I was sitting in that dim, airless cubicle taking care of personal business no one else would ever care to come across.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我更想在客厅里吹萨克斯，可是我们的公寓是造价低廉的那种，整条走廊上的邻居都会抱怨。于是我就把最小的房间改造成一间练习室。说是房间，其实也不过就一个厕所那么大——在里面放把办公椅就满了——可是我用泡沫、鸡蛋托和布拉德利从办公室寄来的旧加垫信封把这里隔了音。我妻子海伦，以前还和我住在一起的时候，看我拿着萨克斯要去那个房间时，就会笑着说，我像是要去厕所，而有时候感觉就是这样。也就是说，我坐在那间阴暗、不通风的房间里，做着自己的事，没人会想要来打扰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So how does someone like me get to be here among these stars and millionaires, having my face altered by the top man in town? I guess it started with my manager, Bradley, who isn't so big-league himself, and doesn't look any more like George Clooney than I do. He first mentioned it a few years ago, in a jokey sort of way, then seemed to get more serious each time he brought it up again. What he was saying, in a nutshell, was that I was ugly. And that this was what was keeping me from the big league.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么像我这种人怎么会跟这些大明星和大富翁住在一起，让全城最顶尖的医生给我整容呢？我想这事儿是我的经纪人布拉德利起的头。他自己也不是什么大腕，也不比我长得更像乔治·克鲁尼。他第一次提起这事儿是在几年前，半开玩笑地，后来再提起的时候，一次比一次认真。他的大意就是我太丑了。正是这一点阻碍我成名。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Until two days ago, Lindy was in the next room here at this swanky hotel, and like me, had her face encased in bandages. Lindy, of course, has a big comfortable house nearby, and hired help, so Dr. Boris let her go home. In fact, from a strictly medical viewpoint, she could probably have gone much sooner, but there were clearly other factors. For one, it wouldn't be so easy for her to hide from cameras and gossip columnists back in her own house. What's more, my hunch is Dr. Boris's stellar reputation is based on procedures that aren't one hundred per cent legal, and that's why he hides his patients up here on this hush-hush floor of the hotel, cut off from all regular staff and guests, with instructions to leave our rooms only when absolutely necessary. If you could see past all the crêpe, you'd spot more stars up here in a week than in a month at the Chateau Marmont.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天前，琳迪还住在这家豪华酒店的隔壁，而且和我一样，整张脸都缠着绷带。琳迪当然在这附近有一所舒适的大房子，还有帮佣，所以鲍里斯医生就让她回家了。事实上，从严格的医学角度来讲，她大概早就可以回去了，但很明显还有其他原因。比如说，回到自己家里就不那么容易躲开照相机和八卦专栏作者了。再者，我的直觉告诉我鲍里斯医生名声好是因为他的做法不是百分百合法，所以他把病人藏在酒店里极其隐秘的这一层，普通员工和客人是找不到这里的，他也嘱咐我们不到万不得已不要离开房间。要是你能透视这些纱布，你在这里待上一个星期比你在夏特蒙特酒店住上一个月更能发现名人。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then Helen came over, put her arms around me and told me that for her at least, I was the most handsome guy in the universe. Then she kind of took a step back and went quiet, and when I asked her what was wrong, she said nothing was wrong. Then she said that perhaps, just perhaps, Bradley had a point. Maybe I should consider having a little work done.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No need to look at me like that!" she yelled back. "Everyone's doing it. And you, you have a professional reason. Guy wants to be a fancy chauffeur, he goes and buys a fancy car. It's no different with you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没必要这么看着我！”她喊道。“大家都这么做。而你，你这么做是出于职业需要。想要当好司机的人就得去买一辆好车。你也一样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at that stage I gave the idea no further thought, even if I was beginning to accept this notion that I was "loser ugly." For one thing, I didn't have the money. In fact, the very moment Helen was talking about fancy chauffeurs, we were nine and a half thousand dollars in debt. This was characteristic of Helen. A fine person in many ways, but this ability to forget completely the true state of our finances and start dreaming up major new spending opportunities, this was very Helen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而那个时候我没有细想这件事，虽说我开始接受这个说法：我是“失败者的丑”。一方面，我没有钱。实话告诉你，海伦说什么好司机的那会儿，我们欠债九千五百美元。这就是海伦。就很多方面而言她是个好人，可是这种全然忘记我们实际的经济状况、开始幻想大笔新的花销的能力，这就是海伦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Money aside, I didn't like the idea of someone cutting me up. I'm not so good with that kind of thing. One time, early in my relationship with Helen, she invited me to go running with her. It was a crisp winter's morning, and I've never been much of a jogger, but I was taken by her and anxious to impress. So there we were running around the park, and I was doing fine keeping up with her, when suddenly my shoe hit something very hard jutting out of the ground. I could feel a pain in my foot, which wasn't so bad, but when I took off my sneaker and sock, and saw the nail on my big toe rearing up from the flesh like it was doing a Hitler-style salute, I got nauseous and fainted. That's the way I am. So you can see, I wasn't wild about face surgery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了钱以外，一想到要被人切来划去的，我就满心的不喜欢。我受不了这类事情。我刚开始和海伦拍拖时，有一次，她叫我跟她一起跑步。那是一个寒冷而干燥的冬天的早晨，我自己从来不怎么跑步，但是那时我被她迷住了，急于想表现自己。于是我们就绕着公园慢跑，一开始我稳稳地跟在她后面，突然我的鞋踢到了地上凸出来的什么硬物，脚疼了一下，但不太厉害。可是当我脱掉运动鞋和袜子一看，大拇指上的趾甲翘了起来，像在做一个希特勒式的敬礼。我感到一阵恶心，昏了过去。我就是这个样子。所以你瞧，我对整容这事儿不感冒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first Helen seemed to see it my way, and the topic didn't come up again for some time. That is, not until she phoned from Seattle to say she was leaving me and moving in with Chris Prendergast, a guy she'd known since high school and who now owned a string of successful diners across Washington. I'd met this Prendergast a few times over the years -- he'd even come to dinner once -- but I'd never suspected a thing. "All that sound-proofing in that cupboard of yours," Bradley said at the time. "It works both ways." I suppose he had a point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始海伦像是站在我这边的，有一段时间没有再提起这件事。就是说，直到她从西雅图打电话来，说她要离开我去跟克里斯·普伦德加斯特在一起。这个普伦德加斯特她从高中起就认识，如今在华盛顿拥有成功的连锁餐厅。这些年我见过这个普伦德加斯特几次——他还来吃过一次晚饭——可是我从来没有怀疑过。“你那个隔音的碗柜，”那时布拉德利说道，“作用是双向的。”我想他说得对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, naturally, there was the principle of the thing. Okay, I've told you before, I'm no stickler for artistic integrity. I play every kind of bubble-gum for the pay. But this proposition was of another order, and I did have some pride left. Bradley was right about one thing: I was twice as talented as most other people in this town. But it seemed that didn't count for much these days. Because it has to do with image, marketability, being in magazines and on TV shows, about parties and who you ate lunch with. It all made me sick. I was a musician, why should I have to join in this game? Why couldn't I just play my music the best way I knew, and keep getting better, if only in my cubicle, and maybe some day, just maybe, genuine music lovers would hear me and appreciate what I was doing. What did I want with a plastic surgeon?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，当然了，还有原则问题。好吧，像我刚才说的，我并不坚持只做什么类型的音乐。为了赚钱，我什么都演。但整容就是另外一码事了，我还是有点尊严的。布拉德利说对了一件事：我的才华是这座城市里大多数人的两倍。然而如今这个不重要了。重要的是形象好、有市场、上杂志、上电视、去派对，还有你和什么人吃饭。这些统统让我恶心。我是个音乐家，我为什么要加入这个游戏呢？我为什么不能按照我心中最理想的方式演奏我的音乐，并且不断进步呢？即使只是在我的小卧室里，也许有一天，只是也许，真正喜欢音乐的人会听见并且欣赏我的演奏。我为什么要整容呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What happened was that a few weeks after her phone call, Helen came back to the apartment to organise moving out her belongings. She looked sad walking around the place -- where, after all, we'd had some happy times. I kept thinking she was about to cry, but she didn't, and just went on putting all her things into neat piles. Someone would be along to pick them up in a day or two, she said. Then as I was on my way to my cubicle, tenor in hand, she looked up and said quietly:</div>

But she felt bad about leaving me, especially at a time when my career wasn't going so good. So she'd thought things over and talked with her new guy, and he too had felt bad about me. Apparently, what he'd said was: "It's just too bad Steve has to pay the price for all our happiness." So here was the deal. Prendergast was willing to pay for me to have my face fixed by the best surgeon in town. "It's true," she said, when I looked back at her blankly. "He means it. No expense spared. All the hospital bills, recuperation, everything. The best surgeon in town." Once my face was fixed, there'd be nothing holding me back, she said.

<div class="line_en">I stopped him here to point out that though over the years I'd become accustomed to the depths to which he could sink when persuading me to do something to his professional advantage, this latest ploy was somewhere so far down in the pits it was a place no light penetrated and where steaming horseshit would freeze in seconds. And on the subject of horseshit, I told him that while I understood how he, on account of his nature, couldn't help shoveling the stuff all the time, it would still be sound strategy on his part to come up with the sort that had at least a chance of taking me in for a minute or two.

<div class="line_en">Finally, maybe six weeks after Helen came up with the offer, I mentioned casually to Bradley that I was thinking it over again. That was all he needed. He was off, making phone calls and arrangements, shouting a lot and getting excited. To give him his due, he was true to his word: he did all the go-between stuff so I didn't have to have a single humiliating conversation with Helen, let alone with Prendergast. At times Bradley even managed to create the illusion he was negotiating a deal for me, that it was me who had something to sell. Even so, I was having doubts several times each day. When it happened, it happened suddenly. Bradley called to say Dr. Boris had a last-minute cancellation and I had to get myself to a particular address by three-thirty that same afternoon with all my bags packed. Maybe I had some final jitters at that point, because I remember Bradley yelling down the phone at me to pull myself together, that he was coming to get me himself, and then I was being driven up winding roads to a big house in the Hollywood Hills and put under anesthetic, just like a character in a Raymond Chandler story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，大概在海伦提议后六个星期，我随口跟布拉德利说到我重新考虑了这件事情。有我这句话就够了。他立马行动，打电话、做安排、又喊又叫，兴奋得不得了。说句公道话，他说到做到：所有的中间协商他全包了，我一次也不用跟海伦进行丢脸的谈话，更不用说跟普伦德加斯特了。有时候布拉德利甚至能够制造出这种假象，感觉他在替我谈一桩生意，感觉有东西可卖的人是我。即便如此，我还是每天都要怀疑好几次。当事情真的来临的时候，来得很突然。布拉德利打电话来说鲍里斯医生突然临时取消了原定计划，我得自己一个人拿着行李在当天下午三点半之前到达指定地点。大概那个时候我临阵退缩了，因为我记得布拉德利在电话里冲我大嚷，叫我振作起来，说他会亲自送我去。接下来，经过九拐十八弯，我被载到了好莱坞山上的一所大房子，打了麻药，就像雷蒙德·钱德勒小说里的人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the next few weeks, work seemed scarcer than ever, and each time I called Bradley to see if he had anything, he'd say something like: "It's hard to help a guy who won't help himself." In the end, I began considering the whole matter more pragmatically. I couldn't get away from the fact that I needed to eat. And if going through with this meant that eventually a lot more people got to hear my music, was that such a bad result? And what about my plans to lead my own band one day? How was that ever going to happen?</div>

I had to sleep propped up on pillows, which meant I didn't sleep much at all, and because my nurse insisted on keeping the room dark all the time, I lost sense of what hour of the day it was. Even so, I didn't feel at all bad. In fact, I felt exhilarated and optimistic. I felt complete confidence in Dr. Boris, who was after all a guy in whose hands movie stars placed their entire careers. What's more, I knew that with me he'd completed his masterpiece; that on seeing my loser's face, he'd felt his deepest ambitions stir, remembered why he'd chosen his vocation in the first place, and put everything into it and more. When the bandages came off, I could look forward to a cleanly chiseled face, slightly brutal, yet full of nuance. A guy with his reputation, after all, would have thought through carefully the requirements of a serious jazz musician, and not confused them with, say, those of a TV anchorman. He may even have put in something to give me that vaguely haunted quality, kind of like the young De Niro, or like Chet Baker before the drugs ravaged him. I thought about the albums I'd make, the line-ups I'd hire to back me. I felt triumphant and couldn't believe I'd ever hesitated about the move.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was during this phase that Gracie first told me Lindy Gardner was next door. Had she brought this news in my earlier, euphoric phase, I'd have greeted it with delight. I might even have taken it as the first indicator of the glamorous life I was now headed for. Coming when it did though, just as I was falling into my trough, the news filled me with such disgust it set off another bout of nausea. If you're one of Lindy's many admirers, I apologise for what's coming up here. But the fact was, at that moment, if there was one figure who epitomised for me everything that was shallow and sickening about the world, it was Lindy Gardner: a person with negligible talent -- okay, let's face it, she's demonstrated she can't act, and she doesn't even pretend to have musical ability -- but who's managed all the same to become famous, fought over by TV networks and glossy magazines who can't get enough of her smiling features. I went past a bookstore earlier this year and saw a snaking line and wondered if someone like Stephen King was around, and here it turns out to be Lindy signing copies of her latest ghosted autobiography. And how was this all achieved? The usual way, of course. The right love affairs, the right marriages, the right divorces. All leading to the right magazine covers, the right talk shows, then stuff like that recent thing she had on the air, I don't remember its name, where she gave advice about how to dress for that first big date after your divorce, or what to do if you suspect your husband is gay, all of that. You hear people talk about her "star quality," but the spell's easy enough to analyse. It's the sheer accumulation of TV appearances and glossy covers, of all the photos you've seen of her at premieres and parties, her arm linked to legendary people. And now here she was, right next door, recovering just like me from a face job by Dr. Boris. No other news could have symbolised more perfectly the scale of my moral descent. The week before, I'd been a jazz musician. Now I was just another pathetic hustler, getting my face fixed in a bid to crawl after the Lindy Gardners of this world into vacuous celebrity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就是在这期间，格雷西第一次告诉我琳迪·加德纳住在隔壁。她要是早点告诉我这件事，在亢奋期的时候，我听了会很开心，甚至把它当作我美好新生活的首个标志。可我偏巧在这个时候听说这件事，在我跌入低潮的时候，听了这个消息我讨厌得又是一阵恶心。若你是琳迪众多的崇拜者之一，我说声抱歉。但事实就是，那时，如果有这么一个人能代表世上所有肤浅和恶心的东西，非琳迪·加德纳莫属：一个一无是处的人——实事求是吧，她已经证明她不会演戏，也不假装有什么音乐才能——可她还是照样能走红，电视和杂志争相报道她，怎么拍都拍不够她的笑脸。之前，我路过一家书店，书店外大排长龙。我以为是斯蒂芬·金什么的来了，结果是琳迪在签售她最新的口述自传。她是怎么做到的？当然是靠老一套。适时的绯闻，适时的结婚，适时的离婚。这样她自然而然就上了应景的封面、脱口秀，或者是像最近她在广播上做的那个节目，我不记得节目的名字了，她在节目里教大家离婚后的首个重要约会应该如何着装打扮，抑或是如果你怀疑你丈夫是同志，你该怎么做，等等。你会听见人们谈论她有什么“明星气质”，但其中的秘诀再简单不过了。就是不断地在电视和杂志封面上抛头露脸，不停地出席各种首映礼和派对，把自己的手搭到名人的胳膊上。如今她就在这里，在隔壁，和我一样接受了鲍里斯医生的面部手术，在休养中。没有什么比这件事更能反映出现在我堕落到了什么地步。一个星期前，我还是一个爵士乐手。如今我成了又一个可怜的骗子，妄图通过整容跟在琳迪·加德纳们的后面，爬进空虚的名流堆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then came the second week, when the effect of the drugs wore off, and I felt depressed, lonely and cheap. My nurse, Gracie, now let a little more light into the room -- though she kept the blinds at least halfway down -- and I was allowed to walk about the room in my dressing gown. So I put one CD after another into the Bang &amp; Olufsen and went round and round the carpet, now and then stopping in front of the dressing-table mirror to inspect the weird bandaged monster gazing back through peephole eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was towards the end of the second week, when I was starting to feel a little better both physically and mentally, my nurse handed me an envelope with a knowing smile, saying: "Now that ain't something you'll get every day."

<div class="line_cn" title="第二个星期快过去的时候，我肉体上和精神上的情况都开始好转。就在这时，我的护士递给我一个信封，神秘地笑了笑，说：“这可不是天天都有的。”信封里是一张酒店的便笺纸。这张纸现在就在我手边，我转抄如下：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next few days, I tried to pass the time reading, but couldn't concentrate. Under the bandages, parts of my face throbbed awfully, others itched like hell and I had bouts of feeling hot and claustrophobic. I longed to play my sax, and the thought that it would be weeks yet until I could put my facial muscles under that kind of pressure made me even more despondent. In the end, I worked out the best way to get through the day was to alternate listening to CDs with spells of staring at sheet music -- I'd brought the folder of charts and lead sheets I worked with in my cubicle -- and humming improvisations to myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lindy gardner had on even more bandages than I did. I'd at least been left an opening at the top, from which my hair sprang up like palms in a desert oasis. But Boris had encased the whole of Lindy's head so it was a contoured coconut shape, with slots only for eyes, nose and mouth. What had happened to all that luxuriant blonde hair, I didn't know.

The song -- I just about remembered it -- was something called "Back at Culver City," a ballad that never quite made it and which no one plays much any more. All the time Tony Gardner sang, the sax kept up with him, replying to him line by line. The whole thing was utterly predictable, and way too sugary.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tony Gardner stopped singing a moment, the strings swelled into the bridge, and the piano player started a solo. At this point, Lindy seemed to come back to the planet. She stopped swaying around, turned the music off with the remote, then came and sat down in front of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托尼·加德纳的声音停了下来，弦乐器在桥段达到高潮，最后只剩下钢琴独奏。这时，琳迪好像回到了人间，停止摇摆，用遥控器关掉音响，然后走过来在我对面坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a while, though, I'd stopped paying much attention to the music because there was Lindy in front of me, gone into a kind of dream, dancing slowly to the song. Her movements were easy and graceful -- clearly the surgery hadn't extended to her body -- and she had a shapely, slim figure. She was wearing something that was part night-gown, part cocktail dress; that's to say, it was at the same time vaguely medical yet glamorous. Also, I was trying to work something out. I'd had the distinct impression Lindy had recently divorced Tony Gardner, but given I'm the nation's worst when it comes to showbiz gossip, I began to think maybe I'd got it wrong. Otherwise why was she dancing this way, lost in the music, evidently enjoying herself?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，我的注意力从音乐上面转移到了琳迪身上。她在我面前缓缓地随着歌曲起舞，自我陶醉了。她动作轻盈、优雅——显然手术没有影响到她的身体——而且她身材苗条、匀称。她穿着一件半是睡衣半是晚礼服的衣服，也就是说，看上去既像病人但又迷人。与此同时，我努力在搞清楚一件事。我印象中琳迪最近刚刚和托尼·加德纳离了婚，但说到演艺圈的八卦，我是全国最差的一个，所以我渐渐地怀疑是我搞错了。要不然她怎么会这样跳着舞，沉醉在音乐里，一副很陶醉的样子？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">SHE TOO HAD ON a dressing gown, but it was the kind she could have worn to a movie premiere without too much embarrassment. Sure enough, the chess set was there on the low glass table, and we sat down on opposite sides like before and began a game. Maybe because we had something to do with our hands, things felt much more relaxed than the last time. As we played, we found ourselves talking about this and that: TV shows, her favourite European cities, Chinese food. There was far less name-dropping this time round, and she seemed much calmer. At one point she said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琳迪也穿着晨衣，可她穿着这身衣服去参加个电影首映礼也没多大问题。棋盘确实已经在矮矮的玻璃桌上摆好了。我们像上次那样面对面坐下，开始下棋。大概是因为有事可做，这次的气氛比上次轻松多了。我们边下棋边东聊西聊：电视节目啦、她最喜欢的欧洲城市啦、中国菜啦。这次没有像上次那样提到很多人的名字，她似乎也比上次安静许多。下着下着，她突然说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The chess set's all laid out, sweetie," she said. "You ready to play? Don't say no, I'm going crazy here with boredom. Oh, and don't forget now, bring those CDs. I'm just dying to hear your playing."</div>

<div class="line_en">I put down the phone, then sat on the edge of the bed trying to figure out how it was I hadn't stood my ground better. In fact, I hadn't put up even a hint of a "no." Maybe it was plain spinelessness. Or maybe I'd taken on board much more of Bradley's argument on the phone than I'd admitted. But now there wasn't time to think about it, because I had to decide which of my CDs were most likely to impress her. The more avant-garde stuff was definitely out, as was the stuff I'd recorded with the electro-funk guys in San Francisco last year. In the end, I chose just the one CD, changed into a fresh shirt, put my dressing gown back over the top and went next door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我放下电话，坐在床边，想不通刚才为什么没有更加坚定自己的立场。我甚至连暗示说“不”都没有。也许我就是没有骨气。也有可能我虽然嘴上不承认，但其实认同了布拉德利的话。可是现在没时间想这些了，我得赶紧决定我的哪些CD最有可能感动她。前卫的是肯定不行的，比如去年我在旧金山跟一群电子乐手合录的那些。最后，我选了一张CD，换上干净的衬衫，再把晨衣披上，到隔壁去。">查看中文翻译</div>

Just inside this building, but it's so vast you can walk around forever. And in the dead of night, it's amazing. Last night I was out there maybe a whole hour? You have to be careful, there's still staff roving around all the time, but I've never been caught. I hear anything at all, I run away and hide somewhere. Once these cleaning guys saw me for a second, but like that I was away into the shadows! It's so exciting. All day you're this prisoner, then it's like you're completely free, it's truly wonderful. I'm gonna take you with me some night, sweetie. I'll show you great things. The bars, the restaurants, conference rooms. Wonderful ballroom. And there's no one there, everything's just dark and empty. And I discovered the most fantastic place, a kind of penthouse, I think it's gonna be a presidential suite?

I swear to you he's not one bit better than he used to be, not one bit. And you know what this news was?

Individually we'd all had more radical ambitions, but we'd formed the band with the express purpose of playing quality mainstream material, the sort the supper crowd would want. Our version of "The Nearness of You" -- which featured my tenor all the way through -- wasn't a hundred miles from Tony Gardner territory, but I'd always been genuinely proud of it. Maybe you think you've heard this song done every way possible. Well, listen to ours. Listen, say, to that second chorus. Or to that moment as we come out of the middle eight, when the band go III-5 to VIx-9 while I rise up in intervals you'd never believe possible and then hold that sweet, very tender high B-flat. I think there are colors there, longings and regrets, you won't have come across before.</div>

<div class="line_en">So you could say I was confident this recording would meet with Lindy's approval. And for the first minute or so, she looked to be enjoying herself. She'd stayed on her feet after loading the CD, and just like the time she'd played me her husband's record, she began swaying dreamily to the slow beat. But then the rhythm faded from her movements, until she was standing there quite still, her back to me, head bent forward like she was concentrating. I didn't at first see this as a bad sign. It was only when she came walking back and sat down with the music still in full flow, I realised something was wrong. Because of the bandages, of course, I couldn't read her expression, but the way she let herself slump into the sofa, like a tense mannequin, didn't look good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此可以说，我有信心这首歌能让琳迪满意。头一两分钟，她似乎很享受。把CD放进去以后她就站在原地，像上次放她丈夫的唱片时那样开始随着缓缓的节拍恍恍惚惚地摇摆起来。可是渐渐地，她的动作越来越小，最后站在那里不动了，背对着我，低着头，像是在专心思考。一开始我并不觉得这是什么坏兆头。可歌还没播完，她就走回来坐下，这时我才意识到有哪里不对了。隔着绷带，我当然没办法看到她的表情，可是她跌倒在沙发里的样子可不好看，像个紧绷绷的模特衣架。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I've said already how my sleep rhythm had been screwed up after the surgery. That evening I became suddenly tired, went to bed early, slept soundly for a few hours, then woke in the dead of night unable to go back to sleep. After a while I got up and turned on the TV. I found a movie I'd seen as a kid, so pulled up a chair and watched what remained of it with the volume down low. When that was over I watched two preachers shouting at each other in front of a baying audience. All in all, I was contented. I felt cosy and a million miles from the outside world. So my heart just about jumped out of my chest when the phone rang.</div>

The ceiling had a fancy central chandelier. At the far end there was a raised stage, probably large enough to put on a fair-sized show, though right now the curtains were drawn across it. Someone had left a step-ladder in the middle of the room and an upright vacuum cleaner against the wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then two evenings ago she knocked on my door and said she was about to check out. Boris was pleased with her and had agreed to take the bandages off in her own house. We said our goodbyes in a friendly way, but it was like our real goodbyes had been said already, that morning right after our escapade, when I'd reached forward and kissed her on both cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，大前天晚上，她过来敲门说她要离开酒店了。鲍里斯对她的情况很满意，同意她回家拆绷带。我们友好地道别，可是似乎我们真正的道别已经说过了，就在那次大冒险过后的早上，当我上前亲吻她的两个脸颊的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I did eventually go round there, maybe four days later, she was welcoming, but distant. Like that first time, she talked a lot about her famous friends -- though none of it about getting them to help with my career. Still, I didn't mind that. We gave chess a try, but her phone kept ringing and she'd go into the bedroom to talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我终于又过去的时候，大概是四天以后，她欢迎我，但有点冷淡。和第一次一样，她侃侃而谈她的名人朋友——虽然没有一个跟帮助我的事业有关，可是我不介意。我们下了棋，可是她的电话响个不停，她老得去卧室接电话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We talked a lot of unimportant stuff -- what she'd watched on TV, how her friend had stopped by with her baby. Then she said Prendergast was asking for me, and when she said that, there was a noticeable tightening in her voice. And I almost said: "Hello? Do I detect a note of irritation associated with lover boy's name?" But I didn't. I just said to say hi to him, and she didn't bring him up again. I'd probably imagined it anyway. For all I know, she was just angling for me to say how grateful I was to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们尽谈些无关紧要的事——她看了什么电视，她的朋友带着孩子顺道去看望她。接着她说普伦德加斯特向我问好，她说这句话的时候语气明显变紧张了。我差点要说：“喂？我是不是听见你说情人的名字时没好气？”可是没有。我只说向他问声好，她没有再提起他。也有可能是我自己想象出来的。说不定她是希望我感激一下他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hasn't she married again?" she asked. And when I put her straight on that, she said: "Oh, right. I must have been thinking about that other one. You know. What's her name."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她还没再婚吗？”她问。当我把事情说给她听，她说：“哦，好吧。我一定是把她跟什么人混起来了，她叫什么名字来着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she was about to go, I said: "I love you," in that fast, routine way you say it at the end of a call with a spouse. There was a silence of a few seconds, then she said it back, in the same routine way. Then she was gone. God knows what that meant. There's nothing to do now, I guess, but wait for these bandages to come off. And then what? Maybe Lindy's right. Maybe, like she says, I need some perspective, and life really is much bigger than loving a person. Maybe this really is a turning point for me, and the big league's waiting. Maybe she's right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她准备挂机的时候，我用夫妻间打完电话时那种快速、例行公事的语气说：“我爱你。”几秒钟的沉默，然后她也用同样例行公事的语气说“我也爱你”，就挂了。天知道她什么意思。我想如今我没什么可做的了，只能等着拆绷带。然后呢？也许琳迪说得对。也许像她说的，我应该向前看，生活确实不单单只是爱一个人。也许这次真的是我的转折点，我的明星梦不远了。也许她说得对。">查看中文翻译</div>
