<div class="line_en">Philip did not find living in Paris as cheap as he had been led to believe and by February had spent most of the money with which he started. He was too proud to appeal to his guardian, nor did he wish Aunt Louisa to know that his circumstances were straitened, since he was certain she would make an effort to send him something from her own pocket, and he knew how little she could afford to. In three months he would attain his majority and come into possession of his small fortune. He tided over the interval by selling the few trinkets which he had inherited from his father.</div>

<div class="line_en">At about this time Lawson suggested that they should take a small studio which was vacant in one of the streets that led out of the Boulevard Raspail. It was very cheap. It had a room attached, which they could use as a bed-room; and since Philip was at the school every morning Lawson could have the undisturbed use of the studio then; Lawson, after wandering from school to school, had come to the conclusion that he could work best alone, and proposed to get a model in three or four days a week. At first Philip hesitated on account of the expense, but they reckoned it out; and it seemed (they were so anxious to have a studio of their own that they calculated pragmatically) that the cost would not be much greater than that of living in a hotel. Though the rent and the cleaning by the concierge would come to a little more, they would save on the petit dejeuner, which they could make themselves. A year or two earlier Philip would have refused to share a room with anyone, since he was so sensitive about his deformed foot, but his morbid way of looking at it was growing less marked: in Paris it did not seem to matter so much, and, though he never by any chance forgot it himself, he ceased to feel that other people were constantly noticing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这个节骨眼儿，劳森正好提议租一间通往拉斯帕尔大街路上的小画室。这间画室是空的，租价非常便宜。画室旁还有个小屋，可以用来当作卧室。菲利普每天早上都去学校，劳森可以利用这段时间静心作画，他去过这么多所学校，最后得出结论：一个人画画的时候才最能出成绩。他提议一周请三四天模特，自己练习。起先菲利普觉得花销有点大，不知道该不该一起租。可后来他们一合计，租间画室并不比住在旅馆里贵多少（他们都急切想有一间属于自己的画室，所以算得很仔细）。虽说房租和付给看门人的清扫费加起来是笔挺大的开销，但是他们能从早餐里省出这笔钱，以后可以自己在家做早餐。要是放在一两年前，菲利普是绝对不会和别人住一间的，因为他对自己的跛脚太敏感。但现在这种病态的心理已经慢慢改善了些。在巴黎，好像残疾并算不上什么了不起的，尽管自己还是对此介意，但已经不再疑神疑鬼，老是觉得其他人也在打量自己的脚了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They moved in, bought a couple of beds, a washing-stand, a few chairs, and felt for the first time the thrill of possession. They were so excited that the first night they went to bed in what they could call a home they lay awake talking till three in the morning; and next day found lighting the fire and making their own coffee, which they had in pyjamas, such a jolly business that Philip did not get to Amitrano's till nearly eleven. He was in excellent spirits. He nodded to Fanny Price.</div>

<div class="line_en">He began to work, vaguely wondering why Fanny Price made herself so disagreeable. He had come to the conclusion that he thoroughly disliked her. Everyone did. People were only civil to her at all from fear of the malice of her tongue; for to their faces and behind their backs she said abominable things. But Philip was feeling so happy that he did not want even Miss Price to bear ill-feeling towards him. He used the artifice which had often before succeeded in banishing her ill-humour.</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave a gasp and threw him a sudden look of anguish. Then two tears rolled down her cheeks. She looked frowsy and grotesque. Philip, not knowing what on earth this new attitude implied, went back to his work. He was uneasy and conscience-stricken; but he would not go to her and say he was sorry if he had caused her pain, because he was afraid she would take the opportunity to snub him. For two or three weeks she did not speak to him, and, after Philip had got over the discomfort of being cut by her, he was somewhat relieved to be free from so difficult a friendship. He had been a little disconcerted by the air of proprietorship she assumed over him. She was an extraordinary woman. She came every day to the studio at eight o'clock, and was ready to start working when the model was in position; she worked steadily, talking to no one, struggling hour after hour with difficulties she could not overcome, and remained till the clock struck twelve. Her work was hopeless. There was not in it the smallest approach even to the mediocre achievement at which most of the young persons were able after some months to arrive. She wore every day the same ugly brown dress, with the mud of the last wet day still caked on the hem and with the raggedness, which Philip had noticed the first time he saw her, still unmended.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="范宁·普里斯深吸一口气，朝菲利普看了一眼，表情里写满了痛苦。两颗泪珠从她的脸颊缓缓滑下。她看上去脏兮兮的，古怪之极。菲利普不知道眼前这演的又是哪一出，只得默不作声地转身继续画画。他的心里也不好受，好像良心受到了谴责。但他不会再跑去找普里斯小姐说话，也不会因为害她伤心而道歉，唯恐她会再抓住个机会数落自己一顿。整整两三个礼拜，普里斯小姐都没和菲利普说一句话。菲利普既然已经从被她打击冷落时的沮丧中缓过劲儿来，也不禁为摆脱了这段棘手的友谊而感到宽慰。普里斯总想把他据为己有，这让他感到很困扰。她确是个与众不同的女人，每天一早八点钟就到画室，模特的姿势一摆好就提笔开画。她画画从不松懈，也不和别人交头接耳，总是一个钟头一个钟头地硬啃那些永远也解决不了的难题。直到正午十二点的钟响了，才会离开画室。她的画烂得无药可救。一般年轻人来画室学上几个月就能达到的普通水平都离她还有一定距离。每天都穿着那件又脏又丑的棕色裙子，裙角上还留着上次下雨时溅上的泥点子。菲利普第一次见到她时，那裙子上破烂的地方到现在也没补好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were walking along the boulevard, and she turned down a side street, then led him into another, poorer still, with cheap shops on the ground floor, and at last stopped. They climbed flight after flight of stairs. She unlocked a door, and they went into a tiny attic with a sloping roof and a small window. This was closed and the room had a musty smell. Though it was very cold there was no fire and no sign that there had been one. The bed was unmade. A chair, a chest of drawers which served also as a wash-stand, and a cheap easel, were all the furniture. The place would have been squalid enough in any case, but the litter, the untidiness, made the impression revolting. On the chimney-piece, scattered over with paints and brushes, were a cup, a dirty plate, and a tea-pot.</div>

It was not only that they were ill-drawn, or that the colour was put on amateurishly by someone who had no eye for it; but there was no attempt at getting the values, and the perspective was grotesque. It looked like the work of a child of five, but a child would have had some naivete and might at least have made an attempt to put down what he saw; but here was the work of a vulgar mind chock full of recollections of vulgar pictures.
