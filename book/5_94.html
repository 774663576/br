<div class="line_en">"Heavenly Father," she prayed, head bowed and hands clasped, "please watch out for Tully Hart and help her through this hard time. Also, please heal her mother's cancer. I know You can help them. Amen." She said a few Hail Marys, and then went back to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她双手合十，低着头开始祈祷：“天上的父啊，请眷顾塔莉·哈特，帮助她渡过这次难关，也求您治愈她母亲的癌症。我知道您一定能帮助她们，阿门。”她念了几次《圣母经》祷文后才回到床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Downstairs, she found what she needed: a small statue of the Virgin Mary, a votive candle in a red glass holder, a book of matches, and her grandmother's old rosary beads. Taking everything back up to her room, she created an altar on top of her dresser, and lit the candle.</div>

<div class="line_en">But all night she tossed and turned, dreaming about the encounter with Tully, wondering what would happen in the morning. Should she talk to Tully today at school, smile at her? Or was she expected to pretend it had never happened? There were rules to popularity, secret codes written in invisible ink that only girls like Tully could read. All Kate knew was that she didn't want to make a mistake and embarrass herself. She knew that sometimes the popular girls were "secret friends" with nerds; like, they smiled and said hi when they weren't in school or when their parents were friends. Maybe that was how it would be with her and Tully.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, she quit trying to sleep and got up. Putting on her robe, she went downstairs. In the living room, her dad looked up from the newspaper and smiled. "Top of the mornin' to you, Katie Scarlett. Come give your old man a hug."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然无法入睡，她决定干脆起床。她穿上睡袍下楼，爸爸在客厅看报纸，听到她下楼的声音，他抬起头微笑，“凯蒂·斯嘉丽，你今天起得真早。快来给老爸抱一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tucked a strand of hair around her ear. She could see how tired he looked; he was working so hard, doing double shifts at Boeing so they could afford their yearly family camping trip. "How's school going?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将一绺发丝塞到她耳后。她看得出来爸爸有多累，他工作非常辛苦，在波音工厂上两轮班，这样才负担得起每年全家一起露营的费用，“你在学校过得好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the same question he always asked. Once, a long time ago, she'd actually answered, said, "Not so good, Dad," and then waited for his advice or comfort or something, but no such words had come. He'd heard what he wanted to hear, not what she'd said. Her mom had said it was because he worked so many hours at the plant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他每次都问同样的问题，很久以前有一次她老实说：“不好，爸爸。”然后等他给予劝告或安慰，什么都好，但他没有反应。他只听到他想听的回答，而不是她真正说的话，妈妈说是因为他在工厂待太久了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kate could have been upset by his distraction, but somehow it had made her love him even more. He never yelled at her or told her to pay attention or reminded her that she was responsible for her own happiness. Those were her mother's words; her dad just quietly went on loving her no matter what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸没有专心听她说话，她或许应该生气才对，但她反而因此更爱他。他从来不会吼她，也不会叫她要专心，更不会叨念着幸福要靠她自己去寻找，这些是妈妈会说的话，爸爸只是静静地爱着她，无论如何都不会改变。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All through morning classes, she looked for Tully, but didn't see her. At lunch she hurried past the crowd of popular kids, who were busy cutting to the front of the food line whenever they felt like it, and sat down at one of the long tables at the very end of the cafeteria. On the other side of the room, kids were laughing and talking and shoving each other; these tables in social Siberia were sadly quiet, though. Kate, like the others seated around her, rarely looked up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个早上她一直在课堂上寻找塔莉，但怎样都找不到。午休时间到了，一群人气高的学生任意插队，凯蒂快步由他们旁边经过，走到最后面的长桌边坐下。餐厅另一头，同学嬉闹聊天、互相推打，而这边的座位却形同社交西伯利亚，完全一片死寂。像同桌的其他人一样，凯蒂很少抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a survival skill the unpopular kids learned early: junior high was like the jungles of Vietnam; it was best to crouch low and keep quiet. So intent was she on her lunch that when someone came up to her and said, "Hey," she practically jumped out of her seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人气的学生很快就学会这种求生技巧：初中宛如越南丛林，最好保持低姿态，不要随便出声。她专心注视着午餐，以至于有人来到她旁边说“嗨”的时候，她吓得由座位上跳起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even on this cool May day, she wore a cut-to-there miniskirt, white go-go boots, shiny black panty hose, and a tube top. Several peace-symbol necklaces bounced against her cleavage. Her hair glinted with copper streaks in the light. A huge macramé-knot purse hung against her thigh. "Have you told anyone about last night?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She and Tully rode their bikes all over the valley and spent hours inner-tubing down the Pilchuck River. In the late afternoons, they stretched out on tiny towels, wearing neon-colored crocheted bikinis, their skin slick with a mixture of baby oil and iodine, listening to Top 40 music on the transistor radio they never left behind. They talked about everything: fashion, music, boys, the war and what was still going on over there, what it would be like to be a reporting duo, movies. Nothing was off-limits; no question couldn't be volleyed over the net. Now it was late August and they were in Kate's bedroom, packing makeup for their trip to the fair. As usual, Kate had to change clothes and put on makeup after she left the house. If she wanted to look cool, anyway. Her mom still thought she was too young for everything. "You got your tube top?" Tully asked.</div>

Every weekday, she rushed through her morning chores without complaint and babysat her brother until three o'clock, when her mom came home from running errands and volunteering on the 4-H council. After that, Kate was free. Weekends were, for the most part, her own.</div>
