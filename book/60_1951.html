<div class="line_en">The next time he answered her summons, the wine and two glasses stood waiting on the table. And this time everything went like clockwork. Before long, they were standing face to face in the bedroom (where the sun was setting on the birches in the painting) and kissing. But when he gave her his standard Strip! command, she not only failed to comply but counter-commanded, No, you first!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她第二次请他去，一瓶葡萄酒、两个杯子早已摆在桌上等着。然而，这次一切都很快。他们很快就来到卧室（画中，夕阳洒落在白桦林上），面面相对，拥在一起。他习惯性地命令道：“把衣服脱了！”然而，她没有服从，而是反过来命令他：“不，您先脱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The odd asymmetry of the woman who looked like a giraffe and a stork continued to excite his memory: the combination of the flirtatious and the gawky; the very real sexual desire offset by the ironic smile; the vulgar conventionality of the flat and the originality of its owner. What would she be like when they made love? Try as he might, he could not picture it. He thought of nothing else for several days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个像长颈鹿又像鹤的女人身上很不协调，令人称奇，只要一想到它，就给他以刺激：笨拙以风骚为伴；天真直白的性渴望与讥讽的微笑相随；住宅平庸俗气，女主人却奇特不凡。做爱时，她会是什么模样？他试图去想象，但不容易。接连几天，他脑子里尽想着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unaccustomed to such a response, he was somewhat taken aback. She started to open his fly. After ordering Strip! several more times (with comic failure), he was forced to accept a compromise. According to the rules of the game she had set up during his last visit ( do as I do ), she took off his trousers, he took off her skirt, then she took off his shirt, he her blouse, until at last they stood there naked. He placed his hand on her moist genitals, then moved his fingers along to the anus, the spot he loved most in all women's bodies. Hers was unusually prominent, evoking the long digestive tract that ended there with a slight protrusion. Fingering her strong, healthy orb, that most splendid of rings called by doctors the sphincter, he suddenly felt her fingers on the corresponding part of his own anatomy. She was mimicking his moves with the precision of a mirror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对这种反应很不习惯，一时有点儿慌张。她开始解他裤子的纽扣。“把衣服脱了！”他又下达了命令，一连几次（很可笑，不奏效），于是，他只有妥协。根据上次她强制的游戏规则（“你一下，我一下”），她为他脱裤子，他为她脱裙子。接着，她脱去他的衬衫，他脱掉她的罩衫，一直到两人赤身相对。他的手放在她潮湿的私处，手指滑向肛门，女人身上的这个地方是他的最爱。她的肛门极其突出，让人明确地联想到长长的消化管道在此处以一个微微的隆节结束。他触摸着这紧闭完整的环形，这最美的圆戒，在医学术语中被称为括约肌。突然，他在臀部同样的位置上感受到了女人的指触。她镜子般精确地重复着他的每个动作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So precipitous was his move that he caught her off guard. As her towering frame fell on its back, he caught among the red blotches on her face the frightened expression of equilibrium lost. Now that he was standing over her, he grabbed her under the knees and lifted her slightly parted legs in the air, so that they suddenly looked like the raised arms of a soldier surrendering to a gun pointed at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这突如其来的举动令她措手不及。细高的身躯仰面倒下，布满红色雀斑的脸闪现出失去平衡的惶恐神情。他站在她面前，抓住她的膝盖，把她微微叉开的双腿举得高高的。这下子，那两条腿就像惊惶的士兵面对挥舞的武器投降时高举的双臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though, as I have pointed out, he had known approximately two hundred women (plus the considerable lot that had accrued during his days as a window washer), he had yet to be faced with a woman who was taller than he was, squinted at him, and fingered his anus. To overcome his embarrassment, he forced her down on the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经说过，他经历过约摸两百个女人（当玻璃擦洗工之后还要多得多），即便如此，他还从未遇到一个比他高的女子，神气活现地站在面前，眯着眼，抚摸他的肛门。为了摆脱尴尬，他猛地把她推倒在床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clumsiness combined with ardor, ardor with clumsiness -- they excited Tomas utterly. He made love to her for a very long time, constantly scanning her red-blotched face for that frightened expression of a woman whom someone has tripped and who is falling, the inimitable expression that moments earlier had conveyed excitement to his brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="笨拙伴着激情，激情伴着笨拙，托马斯感受到绝妙的刺激。他们久久地做爱。他细细察看她长满红色雀斑的脸，在上面寻找女人被绊倒在地时的惊惶神情，那无法模仿的表情刚刚将一股亢奋传入他的大脑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he went to wash in the bathroom. She followed him in and gave him long-drawn-out explanations of where the soap was and where the sponge was and how to turn on the hot water. He was surprised that she went into such detail over such simple matters. At last he had to tell her that he understood everything perfectly, and motioned to her to leave him alone in the bathroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完事之后，他要去浴室冲洗。她跟着进去，细加解释，告诉他肥皂在哪儿，浴用毛巾手套在哪儿，怎样放热水。事情这么简单，她却不厌其详，令他好奇。他说，他都明白了，想单独待在浴室里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Won't you let me stay and watch? she begged.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last he managed to get her out. As he washed and urinated into the washbasin (standard procedure among Czech doctors), he had the feeling she was running back and forth outside the bathroom, looking for a way to break in. When he turned off the water and the flat was suddenly silent, he felt he was being watched. He was nearly certain that there was a peephole somewhere in the bathroom door and that her beautiful eye was squinting through it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他好不容易把她支出门外。他洗了澡，在盥洗盆里撒了尿（捷克医生的惯常做法）。他感觉她在浴室前不耐烦地来回走动，寻找进门的借口。关上水龙头时，他注意到屋子里一片沉寂，他认为她在偷窥。他几乎可以肯定，门上有个洞，她的一只美丽的眼睛正眯着贴在洞上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went off in the best of moods, trying to fix her essence in his memory, to reduce that memory to a chemical formula capable of defining her uniqueness (her millionth part dissimilarity). The result was a formula consisting of three givens:</div>
