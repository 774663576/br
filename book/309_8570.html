<div class="line_en">Prior to waking up, the book thief was dreaming about the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. In the dream, she was attending a rally at which he spoke, looking at the skull-colored part in his hair and the perfect square of his mustache. She was listening contentedly to the torrent of words spilling from his mouth. His sentences glowed in the light. In a quieter moment, he actually crouched down and smiled at her. She returned the smile and said, "Guten Tag, Herr Fuhrer. Wie geht's dir heut?" She hadn't learned to speak too well, or even to read, as she had rarely frequented school. The reason for that she would find out in due course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="醒来之前，偷书贼梦见了元首阿道夫·希特勒。梦里的她正在一个集会上聆听元首的演讲。她注视着他斑驳的白发和那撮形状完美的小胡子。她心满意足地倾听他嘴里流泻而出的话语。那些话似乎在闪闪发光。在某个安静的时刻，他甚至蹲下来对着她微笑。她回了个礼并说道：“您好，我的元首，您今天好吗？”她还不太会说话，也不怎么识字，因为她没怎么上过学。至于不上学的原因，她在适当的时候自然会知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second eye jumped awake and she caught me out, no doubt about it. It was exactly when I knelt down and extracted his soul, holding it limply in my swollen arms. He warmed up soon after, but when I picked him up originally, the boy's spirit was soft and cold, like ice cream. He started melting in my arms. Then warming up completely. Healing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的另一只眼睛翕动着睁开了，她马上发现了我，这一点毫无疑问。那个时候我正跪在地上抽取他的灵魂，轻柔地把他抱在怀里。他很快就变得暖和，不过我刚抱起他的时候，男孩的灵魂柔软而寒冷，像冰激凌。他慢慢在我怀里融化了，然后彻底暖和起来。他的病痊愈了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing to Liesel's left, the grave diggers were rubbing their hands together and whining about the snow and the current digging conditions. "So hard getting through all the ice," and so forth. One of them couldn't have been more than fourteen. An apprentice. When he walked away, after a few dozen paces, a black book fell innocuously from his coat pocket without his knowledge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个掘墓人站在莉泽尔左边，一边搓手一边抱怨这场雪，抱怨这种天气挖墓穴有多困难，像“凿穿这些冰可真够费事的”，诸如此类。其中一个人肯定不到十四岁，是一名学徒。他走开的时候，一本黑色的书悄无声息地从他的外套口袋里滑落，他一点儿也不知道，已经走到几十步开外的地方去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd been expecting a girl and a boy and would be paid a small allowance for having them. Nobody wanted to be the one to tell Rosa Hubermann that the boy didn't survive the trip. In fact, no one ever really wanted to tell her anything. As far as dispositions go, hers wasn't really enviable, although she had a good record with foster kids in the past. Apparently, she'd straightened a few out.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was the constant rise and fall of her stomach, and the futile hopes that they'd lose their way or change their minds. Among it all, her thoughts couldn't help turning toward her mother, back at the Bahnhof, waiting to leave again. Shivering. Bundled up in that useless coat. She'd be eating her nails, waiting for the train. The platform would be long and uncomfortable -- a slice of cold cement. Would she keep an eye out for the approximate burial site of her son on the return trip? Or would sleep be too heavy?</div>

<div class="line_en">After a few minutes, a very tall man came out. Hans Hubermann, Liesel's foster father. On one side of him was the medium-height Frau Heinrich. On the other was the squat shape of Rosa Hubermann, who looked like a small wardrobe with a coat thrown over it. There was a distinct waddle to her walk. Almost cute, if it wasn't for her face, which was like creased-up cardboard and annoyed, as if she was merely tolerating all of it. Her husband walked straight, with a cigarette smoldering between his fingers. He rolled his own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually, Liesel Meminger walked gingerly inside. Hans Hubermann had her by one hand. Her small suitcase had her by the other. Buried beneath the folded layer of clothes in that suitcase was a small black book, which, for all we know, a fourteen-year-old grave digger in a nameless town had probably spent the last few hours looking for. "I promise you," I imagine him saying to his boss, "I have no idea what happened to it. I've looked everywhere. Everywhere!" I'm sure he would never have suspected the girl, and yet, there it was -- a black book with silver words written against the ceiling of her clothes:</div>
