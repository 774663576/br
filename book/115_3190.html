<div class="line_en">The weather was wet and cold for quite a week, as it often can be in the west country in the early summer, and we did not go down to the beach again. I could see the sea from the terrace, and the lawns. It looked grey and uninviting, great rollers sweeping in to the bay past the beacon on the headland. I pictured them surging into the little cove and breaking with a roar upon the rocks, then running swift and strong to the shelving beach. If I stood on the terrace and listened I could hear the murmur of the sea below me, low and sullen. A dull, persistent sound that never ceased. And the gulls flew inland too, driven by the weather. They hovered above the house in circles, wheeling and crying, flapping their spread wings. I began to understand why some people could not bear the clamour of the sea. It has a mournful harping note sometimes, and the very persistence of it, that eternal roll and thunder and hiss, plays a jagged tune upon the nerves. I was glad our rooms were in the east wing and I could lean out of my window and look down upon the rose-garden. For sometimes I could not sleep, and getting softly out of bed in the quiet night I would wander to the window, and lean there, my arms upon the sill, and the air would be very peaceful, very still.</div>

<div class="line_en">I could not hear the restless sea, and because I could not hear it my thoughts would be peaceful too. They would not carry me down that steep path through the woods to the grey cove and the deserted cottage. I did not want to think about the cottage. I remembered it too often in the day. The memory of it nagged at me whenever I saw the sea from the terrace. For I would see once more the blue spots on the china, the spun webs on the little masts of those model ships, and the rat holes on the sofa bed. I would remember the pattering of the rain on the roof. And I thought of Ben, too, with his narrow watery blue eyes, his sly idiot's smile. These things disturbed me, I was not happy about them. I wanted to forget them but at the same time I wanted to know why they disturbed me, why they made me uneasy and unhappy. Somewhere, at the back of my mind, there was a frightened furtive seed of curiosity that grew slowly and stealthily, for all my denial of it, and I knew all the doubt and anxiety of the child who has been told, "these things are not discussed, they are forbidden."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这儿听不到骚动不已的大海的吵闹，因此我的心境才得以安静，才能不去想那条穿林而过通往褐色小海湾的陡峭幽径，还有那座海滩弃屋。我实在不愿想起那座小屋，可是在白天这办不到。站在平台上一望见大海，我就老是想起它：瓷器上蓝色的霉斑；船艇模型桅杆上的蜘蛛网；坐卧两用沙发上鼠咬的破洞；雨点拍打屋顶的声音。我还想起那个名叫贝恩的陌生人，想起他那水汪汪的蓝色小眼睛和那种白痴般的诡秘怪笑。所有这些扰得我无法平静，不得安生。我想设法忘却这一切；与此同时，我又想弄个明白，是什么原因使得我如此惴惴不安，烦恼重重。尽管我拒不承认，但是在我的心底某处确实已有一种暗自好奇的心理，一种疑惧的种子，在缓慢而又是一刻不停地滋长。一个小孩在被告知“这些事谈论不得，不能让你知道”之后所产生的疑问，以及想打听个究竟的急切心情，我全体验到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could not forget the white, lost look in Maxim's eyes when we came up the path through the woods, and I could not forget his words. "Oh, God, what a fool I was to come back". It was all my fault, because I had gone down into the bay. I had opened up a road into the past again. And although Maxim had recovered, and was himself again, and we lived our lives together, sleeping, eating, walking, writing letters, driving to the village, working hour by hour through our day, I knew there was a barrier between us because of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忘不了那天走在林中小径上迈克西姆惶恐和茫然若有所失的眼神，还有他那句话：“啊，上帝，我多蠢，干吗要回来？”都是我不好，偏要朝海湾跑，这就又勾起了他对往事的回忆。虽然迈克西姆后来又恢复了常态，虽然我们共桌进餐，同床安寝，携手散步，比肩伏案写信，一起驾车到村子去，每时每刻形影不离，可我总感觉到因为那天的事，我俩之间已有了隔阂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked alone, on the other side, and I must not come to him. And I became nervous and fearful that some heedless word, some turn in a careless conversation should bring that expression back to his eyes again. I began to dread any mention of the sea, for the sea might lead to boats, to accidents, to drowning… Even Frank Crawley, who came to lunch one day, put me in a little fever of fear when he said something about the sailing races in Kerrith harbour, three miles away. I looked steadily at my plate, a stab of sickness in my heart at once, but Maxim went on talking quite naturally, he did not seem to mind, while I sat in a sweat of uncertainty wondering what would happen and where the conversation would lead us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他像是独自走在大路的另一侧，我可不得越雷池一步地向他靠拢。我老是神经紧张，生怕自己一时大意说漏了嘴，或是在随便的交谈中不当心话锋一转，又会使他露出那种眼神。我怕提到大海，因为说到大海就会使人联想到船只，联想到海难事故，联想到淹死人…有一天，弗兰克—克劳利来吃中饭。他谈起离此三英里地的克里斯港举行划船比赛，甚至这样的谈话也把我吓得像是害了热病，心里如刀扎似地难受，赶快低下头盯着面前的菜盘。可是迈克西姆好像并不在乎，照样谈笑风生。只有我在一旁提心吊胆，浑身直冒汗，不知道这番谈话又会引起什么不愉快的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For we were called upon, I remember, during those first weeks, by people who lived near us in the county, and the receiving of them, and the shaking hands, and the spinning out of the formal half-hour became a worse ordeal than I first anticipated, because of this new fear of mine that they would talk about something that must not be discussed. The agony of those wheels on the drive, of that pealing bell, of my own first wild rush for flight to my own room. The scrambled dab of powder on my nose, the hasty comb through my hair, and then the inevitable knock on the door and the entrance of the cards on a silver salver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，每当有客来访，我就更加受罪，表现得益发手足无措，呆头呆脑。在返回曼陀丽的头几周里，我记得，本郡左近的邻人络绎来访。接待这些宾客，握手寒暄，无话找话打发这礼尚往来的半点钟——这一切竟比我原先想象的更折磨人，因为现在又增添了一层新的疑虑，生怕这些人会说出一些不该说的话来。一听见车道上有车轮滑行的声音，接着是撕裂耳鼓的门铃，我就心慌意乱地忙着往自己房间里躲。这一切真叫人受罪！躲进房间以后，我手忙脚乱地往鼻子上搽些脂粉，匆匆梳几下头发，接着总是一阵叩门声，仆人送上放在银托盘里的来客名片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was during cheese, Frith had left the room, and I remember getting up and going to the sideboard, and taking some more cheese, not wanting it, so as not to be at the table with them, listening; humming a little tune to myself so I could not hear. I was wrong of course, morbid, stupid; this was the hypersensitive behaviour of a neurotic, not the normal happy self I knew myself to be. But I could not help it. I did not know what to do. My shyness and gaucherie became worse, too, making me stolid and dumb when people came to the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得当时大家正在吃干酪。弗里思刚走开，所以我就站起身，到墙边的餐具柜再去取来一些干酪。这之所以这样做，并不是因为干酪吃光了，而是因为我不想坐在桌旁听他们说话。我一边走，一边哼着小调，这样就可以听不见他们谈话的内容。当然，我的担心毫无道理，甚至有点愚蠢。这种反常的过敏是精神病患者行为的特征，同我平时开朗的性格毫无共同之处。可这完全是情不自禁的，不这样又叫我怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right. I'll be down immediately." The clap of my heels on the stairs and across the hall, the opening of the library door or, worse still, that long, cold, lifeless drawing-room, and the strange woman waiting there, or two of them perhaps, or a husband and a wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，我这就下来。”于是，楼梯上和大厅里响起我啪嗒啪嗒的脚步声。拉开藏书室的门（有时候情况更糟糕，客人被领到那阴冷而无生气的大客厅），里面是一位陌生女宾，也许是两位，或是一对夫妇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do you do? I'm sorry; Maxim is in the garden somewhere, Frith has gone to find him."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes, rather…" And in my shyness and anxiety to please, those schoolgirls" phrases would escape from me again, those words I never used except in moments like these, "Oh, ripping"; and "Oh, topping"; and "absolutely"; and "priceless"; even, I think, to one dowager who had carried a lorgnette "cheerio". My relief at Maxim's arrival would be tempered by the fear they might say something indiscreet, and I became dumb at once, a set smile on my lips, my hands in my lap. They would turn to Maxim then, talking of people and places I had not met or did not know, and now and again I would find their eyes upon me, doubtful, rather bewildered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，当然，我挺…”由于腼腆怯生，同时又想讨好这些客人，我不禁又用上平素不用的女学生的语言，什么“啊，挺帅的”，“喔，妙极”，“没说的”，“真来劲儿”等等，都会脱口而出。我记得有一次，竟对着一位手持长柄眼镜的王公未亡人喊出了“呱呱叫”！迈克西姆进屋以后，虽说可以让我松一口气，但同时又使我胆颤心惊，生伯客人无忌讳地说出一些不该说的话。因此，我马上就变成个哑巴，手揣在怀里，唇边挂着尴尬僵化的微笑。客人们一见这阵势，总是转身去跟迈克西姆聊天，谈论那些我一无所知的人物和地方，还不时向我投来大惑不解的疑问的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes I would glean little snatches of information to add to my secret store. A word dropped here at random, a question, a passing phrase. And, if Maxim was not with me, the hearing of them would be a furtive, rather painful pleasure, guilty knowledge learnt in the dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，在这类谈话中我能够搜集到一些零星的材料，以充实内心的秘密仓库。所谓零星的材料，无非是交谈过程中随口漏出的一个词，一个问题，一个短语。要是迈克西姆不在场，听到这类片言只语，我会因为在暗地里窃得一些情况而偷偷觉着一种带痛楚的乐趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could picture them saying to one another as they drove away, "My dear, what a dull girl. She scarcely opened her mouth", and then the sentence I had first heard upon Beatrice's lips, haunting me ever since, a sentence I read in every eye, on every tongue -- "She's so different from Rebecca."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想象得出客人坐车离开曼陀丽时的对话：“亲爱的，多么平庸乏味的一个女人！她差不多没有开口说话。”接着便是我头一回从比阿特丽斯嘴里听到的那句话：“她跟自蓓卡多么不一样！”打那次以后，这句话老是缠着我，在每位来客的眼光和言谈中，我仿佛都看到这几个字：“她跟吕蓓卡多么不一样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would return a call perhaps, for Maxim was punctilious in these matters and would not spare me, and if he did not come with me I must brave the formality alone, and there would be a pause in the conversation while I searched for something to say. "Will you be entertaining much at Manderley, Mrs de Winter?" they would say, and my answer would come, "I don't know, Maxim has not said much about it up to the present."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时，也许还得对客人进行回拜。在这类事情上，迈克西姆刻板拘泥，不肯放过我。要是他不跟我同行，我就得豁出去，独自去应付这种正式场面。我得搜索枯肠，无话找话，因此宾主之间常出现冷场。每逢这种时候，主人就问：“德温特夫人，你们有没有在曼陀丽经常接待宾客的打算？”我则回答：“我不知道。到目前为止，迈克西姆还没说起过。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，一点不错。”过了一会，我看看被手套遮没的表，说道：“四点多了吧？恐怕我得告辞了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No -- No, really, thanks most awfully. I promised Maxim…" my sentence would go trailing off into nothing, but the meaning would be understood. We would both rise to our feet, both of us knowing I was not deceived about her offer to tea nor she in my mention of a promise to Maxim. I had sometimes wondered what would happen if convention were denied, if, having got into the car and waved a hand to my hostess on the doorstep, I suddenly opened it again, and said, "I don't think I'll go back after all. Let's go to your drawing-room again and sit down. I'll stay to dinner if you like, or stop the night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不啦，不啦。非常感谢。我出来时跟迈克西姆说好的…”这句话拖长着声音不说完，意思则大家心照不宣。就这样，宾主同时站起身，双方都很清楚对方的告别托辞或挽留表示全是客套虚礼。有时候我也想，要是我把礼仪俗套统统抛到九霄云外，会出现什么样的局面？在坐进汽车并向站在门口台阶上的女主人挥过手之后，突然打开车门说：“我实在并不急着回去。走，再到您家客厅里去坐坐，要是您觉得可以，我吃了晚饭再走，或者干脆就在这儿过夜。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, indeed," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I feel happier," I said, "much happier. And I've got you for my friend whatever happens, haven't I, Frank?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这会儿我才觉得好受些，”我说。“好受多了。今后不管发生什么事，你总是我的朋友，对吗，弗兰克克？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He paused, looking at me a little suspiciously. "That's not quite fair," he said, "you might ask me something that I should not be able to answer, something quite impossible."</div>

<div class="line_en">We were out of the dark wooded drive and into the light again. The rhododendrons were upon us. Their hour would soon be over. Already they looked a little overblown, a little faded. Next month the petals would fall one by one from the great faces, and the gardeners would come and sweep them away. Theirs was a brief beauty. Not lasting very long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走出黑林子，车道豁然开朗，迎面出现了石南花。石南的季节行将过去，所以花朵已多少过了全盛期，开始褪色凋败。到了下个月，花瓣将从浓艳的花盘上纷纷坠地，园丁就会跑来打扫。石南的美是短暂的，决不能永远驻颜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Frank," I said, "before we put an end to this conversation, for ever let's say, will you promise to answer me one thing, quite truthfully?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“弗兰克，”我说，“但愿我们永远不再谈这个话题，可在谈话结束之前，你能不能如实回答我一个问题？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We came round the sweep of the drive and Manderley was before us, serene and peaceful in the hollow of the lawns, surprising me as it always did, with its perfect symmetry and grace, its great simplicity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们已拐弯走上车道的开阔地段，曼陀丽座落在草坪环绕的低地上，静谧而安详。每次见到这大宅，我总是为其完美的对称和气派，为其朴实无华而惊诧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sunlight flickered on the mullioned windows, and there was a soft rusted glow about the stone walls where the lichen clung. A thin column of smoke curled from the library chimney. I bit my thumbnail, watching Frank out of the tail of my eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阳光在竖框窗上闪耀。围绕着爬满地衣的石墙，有一种色彩柔和的古色古香的光华。一缕青烟从藏书室烟囱袅袅飘起。我咬着拇指指甲，用眼相打量着弗兰克。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell me," I said, my voice casual, not caring a bit, "tell me, was Rebecca very beautiful?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank waited a moment. I could not see his face. He was looking away from me towards the house. "Yes," he said slowly, "yes, I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw in my life."</div>
