<div class="line_en">It was the last day of July. The long hot summer was coming to an end, and I was feeling ill and depressed. I was also short of money, so I had little chance of escaping from the dusty London streets, and would have to spend the autumn economically between my rooms in the city and my mother's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是7月的最后一天。漫长、炎热的夏季已经接近尾声，但我觉得身体不太舒服，心情也有些压抑。我没什么钱，不大可能离开尘土飞扬的伦敦，只得在伦敦的住处和母亲的家中将就这个秋天了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother and my sister, Sarah, lived in a cottage in Hampstead, in the northern suburbs, and I usually went to see them twice a week. This evening I arrived at the gate of the cottage just as it was starting to get dark. I had hardly rung the bell before the door was opened violently, and my Italian friend, Professor Pesca, rushed out to greet me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲和妹妹萨拉住在伦敦北郊汉普斯特德的一所小房子里，我每星期会去看她们两次。今天我到那里的时候，天已经快黑了。刚一按门铃，我的意大利朋友，佩斯卡教授就用力打开了门，箭步冲出来迎接我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pesca was a language teacher who had left Italy for political reasons and had made his home in England. He was a strange, excitable little man, who was always trying to be more English than the English. I had met him from time to time when he was teaching in the same houses as I was, and then one day I met him by chance in Brighton. We agreed to go for a swim together in the sea. He was very enthusiastic and it never for a moment occurred to me that he did not know how to swim! Fortunately, when he suddenly sank to the bottom, I was able to dive down and save him. From that day on he was my grateful friend, and that evening he showed his gratitude to me in a way that changed my whole life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩斯卡由于政治原因从意大利来到英国，在这里做语言教师，安顿了下来。他个头不高，性格古怪而天真，极力表现出比英国人还地道的英国做派。我曾经和他在几个家庭里同为家庭教师，所以经常见面。有一天，我在布赖顿碰到他，两人说好一同到海滨游泳。他当时非常兴奋，我根本没想到他竟然不会游泳！幸好他突然沉下去的时候，我潜进水里把他救了上来。从那以后，他对我感激不尽，我们成了朋友，而这天晚上他的感恩之举改变了我的一生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, my good friends," he said, when we were all in my mother's sitting-room. "I have some wonderful news for you. I have been asked by my employer to recommend a drawing teacher for a post with a rich family in the north of England. And who do you think I have recommended? The best drawing teacher in the world -- Mr Walter Hartright!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家齐聚客厅时，他说：“嘿，朋友们，我有一个好消息要告诉你们。我的东家让我为英格兰北部一个富有的人家推荐一名绘画教师。你们猜我推荐了谁？我推荐的是世界上最好的绘画教师——沃尔特·哈特里特先生！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dear Pesca! How good you are to Walter!" exclaimed my mother. "How kind, how generous you are!"</div>

<div class="line_en">As for myself, although I was certainly grateful for his kindness, I still felt strangely depressed. I thanked him warmly, however, and asked to see the conditions. The note he gave me said that a qualified drawing teacher was wanted by Mr Frederick Fairlie of Limmeridge House, Cumberland, to teach his two young nieces for a period of at least four months. The teacher was to live at Limmeridge House as a gentleman and receive four pounds a week. Letters to show he was of good character would be required.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本人也很感激他的好意，但是总觉得有一种莫名的不安。不过我还是热情地跟他道谢，向他打听一些具体情况。他给我的条子上说坎伯兰郡利默里奇庄园的弗雷德里克·费尔利先生要聘请一位优秀的绘画教师，教他的两个侄女画画，聘期至少四个月。受聘教师将住在利默里奇庄园，薪水是一星期4英镑。应聘教师必须出具品行良好的证明信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The position was certainly an attractive one, and I could not understand why I felt so little enthusiasm for it. However, since my mother and sister thought it was a great opportunity, and I had no wish to hurt Pesca's feelings, I agreed to apply for the job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这的确是一份令人心动的工作，但不知为什么我就是兴奋不起来。不管怎样，既然母亲和妹妹都认为这是个好机会，我也不愿伤害佩斯卡的感情，于是我答应应聘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning I sent my letters of recommendation to the Professor's employer, and four days later I heard that Mr Fairlie accepted my services and requested me to start for Cumberland immediately. I arranged to leave the next day, and in the evening I walked to Hampstead to say goodbye to my mother and Sarah.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="转天早晨，我把推荐信寄给佩斯卡的雇主，四天之后传来消息说，费尔利先生接受了我的应聘，要我立即动身前往坎伯兰郡。我做好了第二天动身的准备，晚上步行到汉普斯特德向母亲和妹妹道别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I left them at midnight, a full moon was shining in a dark blue, starless sky, and the air was soft and warm. I decided to take the long route home, and walk across Hampstead Heath before joining the road into the centre of the city. After a while I came to a crossroads and turned onto the London road. I was lost in my own thoughts, wondering about the two young ladies in Cumberland, when suddenly, my heart seemed to stop beating. A hand had touched my shoulder from behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开她们已是子夜时分，深蓝的天空满月高悬，看不见一颗星星，空气温暖宜人。我决定走那条稍远一点儿的路回家，先穿过汉普斯特德荒地，再走通往市中心的那条路。不一会儿，我来到十字路口，踏上了通向伦敦的大路。我满脑子在想着坎伯兰郡两位小姐的事，突然一只手从后面拍了拍我的肩膀，吓得我心跳都快停止了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked at her carefully. It was then nearly one o'clock. All I could see in the moonlight was a young colourless face, large sad eyes, and light brown hair. Her manner was quiet and self-controlled. What sort of woman she was, and why she was out so late alone, I could not guess. But there was nothing evil about her -- indeed, a kind of sad innocence seemed to come from her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仔细打量着她。这时已将近凌晨1点了。借着月光我只能看出一张年轻却没有血色的脸，一对哀伤的大眼睛和淡棕色的头发。她看上去镇定自若。我猜不出她是个什么样的女人，这么晚了为什么孤身一人在外面。可是她看上去没有恶意，实际上还流露出一丝哀伤和纯真。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did you hear me?" she said, quietly and rapidly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你听见我说话了吗？”她很快地轻声说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不会怀疑我在做什么坏事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I heard you coming," she said, "and hid behind those trees to see what sort of man you were, before I risked speaking. May I trust you?" Her eyes searched my face, anxiously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听到你走过来，”她说，“就先躲在树后看你是什么样的人，然后才敢同你说话的。我能信赖你吗？”她不安地看着我的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her loneliness and helplessness were so obvious that I felt great sympathy for her. "Tell me how I can help you," I said, "and if I can, I will."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看起来实在是非常孤独和无助，这大大地激起了我的同情。“说吧，我能为你做什么，”我说，“只要我能做的，一定帮忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, thank you, thank you. You are very kind." Her voice trembled a little as she spoke. "I don't know London at all. Can I get a cab or a carriage at this time of night?

<div class="line_cn" title="“你认识伦敦有准男爵爵位的人吗？”她突然问我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a note of suspicion in the strange question, and when I said I knew no Baronets, she seemed relieved. I questioned her further, and she murmured that she had been cruelly used by a Baronet she would not name. She told me she came from Hampshire and asked if I lived in London. I explained that I did, but that I was leaving for Cumberland the next day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这个奇怪的问题可以看出她对我还是有所怀疑，当我告诉她我一个准男爵也不认识时，她似乎才松了一口气。我进一步追问，她低声告诉我一个准男爵害过她，她不愿说出他的名字。她说她从汉普郡来，问我是否住在伦敦。我告诉她我是住在伦敦，但天一亮就要去坎伯兰郡了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My travelling instructions directed me to Carlisle and then to change trains for Limmeridge. However, because of a long delay I missed my connection and did not get to Limmeridge till past ten.
