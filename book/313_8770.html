<div class="line_en">Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece, and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back his left shirtcuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist, all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally, he thrust the point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined armchair with a long sigh of satisfaction.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject; but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多个月以来，我亲眼见证了他每天会做三次这样的行为，虽然已经习惯，但仍不能泰然处之。恰恰相反，随着日子一天天过去，这样的场景让我越来越焦急，但却无法鼓起勇气制止他，这让我每晚都良心不安。我一次又一次地下定决心要跟他谈这件事，但是，我的朋友性情冷漠孤僻，使人难以轻松、随意地与他交流。他强大的能力、娴熟的举止，以及我所体验过的他那各种独特的性格，都使我犹豫退缩，不敢惹他不高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

Your brain may, as you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid process which involves increased tissue-change and may at least leave a permanent weakness. You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon you. Surely the game is hardly worth the candle.

Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants.

I examine the data, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion. I claim no credit in such cases. My name figures in no newspaper. The work itself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my highest reward. But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, indeed," said I cordially. "I was never so struck by anything in my life. I even embodied it in a small brochure, with the somewhat fantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.'"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他哀伤地摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I glanced over it," said he. "Honestly, I cannot congratulate you upon it. Detection is, or ought to be, an exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner. You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我粗略地扫过一遍，”他说，“老实说，实在无法恭维。侦查工作是一门，或者说应该是一门精确的科学，应该受到同样冷静、客观的对待。你用浪漫主义为其渲染出色彩，这就像是在欧几里得的第五公设里掺杂了爱情故事或私奔段子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但浪漫情节确实存在，”我反驳道，“我不能扭曲事实。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Some facts should be suppressed, or, at least, a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them. The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes, by which I succeeded in unravelling it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些事实可以压缩，或者，在处理这些事实的比例分配上，要有合理的观念。在这个案子里，唯一值得被提及的，就是我如何从事实结果中找出原因，并根据它来成功破案。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him. I confess, too, that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings. More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner. I made no remark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg. I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and though it did not prevent me from walking it ached wearily at every change of the weather.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的作品是专门为了取悦他而创作的，所以，听到他的批评后，我被惹恼了。我也承认，是他的自负激怒了我，他似乎是在要求我，册子里的每一句话都应该用来描述他一个人的特殊行为。在我和他共同居住在贝克街的这些年里，我不止一次地发觉，在我那伙伴安静的说教行为之下，隐藏着一点儿高傲自负。我没有再说什么，只是坐下来，抚摸我受伤的腿。我的腿曾经被子弹打穿过，尽管这并未妨碍我正常行走，但它在每次气候变化的时候疼得厉害。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My practice has extended recently to the Continent," said Holmes after a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe. "I was consulted last week by Francois le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service. He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art. The case was concerned with a will and possessed some features of interest. I was able to refer him to two parallel cases, the one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have suggested to him the true solution. Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最近，我的业务扩展到了欧洲大陆，”过了一会儿，福尔摩斯说道，一边说，一边填满了他的殴石南烟斗，“上星期就有一个叫做弗朗索瓦·勒·维拉尔的人来向我咨询，可能你也知道，这个人最近在法国侦探界已经崭露头角。他具有凯尔特民族的敏感性，可是缺乏提高他自身侦探艺术所必需的宽泛的知识面。这个案子与遗嘱有关，很有意思。我介绍了两个类似的案件给他作参考，一件是一八五七年里加城的案件，另一件是一八七一年圣路易斯城的案子，给他提供了寻找真正解决方法的思路。这是我今天早上收到的他的感谢信。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He tossed over, as he spoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down it, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray magnifiques, coup-de-maîtres and tours-de-force, all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, he rates my assistance too highly," said Sherlock Holme slightly. "He has considerable gifts himself. He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective. He has the power of observation and that of deduction. He is only wanting in knowledge, and that may come in time. He is now translating my small works into French."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，他把我的帮助看得太高了，”舍洛克·福尔摩斯轻轻地说道，“他自己也具备一定的天赋。他拥有作为一个理想侦探必需的三项条件中的两项——观察和推理的能力。他只是缺乏一些学识，而随着时间的推移，他也一定会得到。他现在正把我的几篇小作品译成法文。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your works?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的作品？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, didn't you know?" he cried, laughing. "Yes, I have been guilty of several monographs. They are all upon technical subjects. Here, for example, is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccos.' In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar, cigarette, and pipe tobacco, with coloured plates illus- trating the difference in the ash. It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue. If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder had been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously narrows your field of search. To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，你不知道吗？”他大声笑起来，“是的，很惭愧，我写过几篇专论。全部都是技术方面的。嗯，比如说那篇《论各种烟草的烟灰辨认》。在那篇文章里，我列举了一百四十种雪茄、烟卷和烟斗丝的烟灰，还用彩色的插图来说明各种烟灰的区别。这是一个在罪案中常常出现的要点，而许多时候会成为极其重要的线索。比如，如果你可以确切地说，某件凶案是一个抽印度雪茄烟的人犯下的，这很显然就可以把你的侦查范围缩小了。对于训练有素的人来说，印度特里奇雪茄烟的黑灰和‘鸟眼’烟的白灰之间的区别，就跟白菜和土豆一样显著。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I appreciate their importance. Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the hands of slaters, sailors, cork-cutters, compositors, weavers, and diamond-polishers. That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective -- especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in discovering the antecedents of criminals. But I weary you with my hobby."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为它们非常重要。这是我写的关于追踪脚印的专论，里面还提及如何利用熟石灰来保存这些印记。这里还有一些新奇的小作品，是关于不同职业对人的手形的影响的，并附有石工、水手、木刻工人、排字工人、织布工人和磨钻工人的手形插图。这些对于科学侦探学有很大的实践意义——尤其是在遇上无名尸体和探究罪犯身份的时候。我的爱好可能让你生厌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not at all," I answered earnestly. "It is of the greatest interest to me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it. But you spoke just now of observation and deduction. Surely the one to some extent implies the other."</div>

"For example, observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦不，几乎没有什么关联，”他回答，很舒服地靠在躺椅里，从他的烟管里吐出浓浓的蓝色烟圈，“比如说，观察告诉我，你今天早上去了威格莫尔街邮局，而推理让我知道，你在那里发过一封电报。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is simplicity itself," he remarked, chuckling at my surprise --"so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction. Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep. Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth, which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering. The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere else in the neighbourhood. So much is observation. The rest is deduction."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它本身就再简单明晰不过了，”看到我的讶异，他说，“简单到无需解释，但这番解释却能定义观察和推理的界限。观察告诉我，你的鞋面上粘了一小块红色泥巴。威格莫尔街邮局的对面正在修路，从中挖掘出来的泥巴铺在路上，进邮局的人很难不粘到它们。据我所知，这种带一点儿红色的特殊泥土，在附近只有邮局对面有。这些就是观察。剩下的则是推理。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite so. The W. suggests your own name. The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch: so it was made for the last generation. Jewellery usually descends to the eldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father. Your father has, if I remember right, been dead many years. It has, therefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多。W代表你自己的姓氏。这块表差不多是50年前生产的，而表上刻的字跟表一样古旧，所以我认为是上一辈传下来的。珠宝一般传给最年长的儿子，而他最有可能跟你的父亲拥有同样的姓名。你的父亲，如果我记得没错的话，许多年前就过世了。那么，这块表就应该在你长兄手中了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, no: I never guess. It is a shocking habit -- destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend. For example, I began by stating that your brother was careless. When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket. Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man. Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不不，我从来不猜。猜测对于逻辑推理来说是很不好的习惯。你之所以会觉得奇怪，是因为你并没有跟上我的思维，也没有发现这些小细节中所隐藏的玄机。比如说，我从推断你的哥哥很粗心开始。当你观察这块表的下部时，你会发现，除了两块明显的凹痕以外，上面还布满各种各样的伤痕，从这能看出，它的主人曾习惯把它跟各种坚硬的物件放在同一个口袋里，比如说硬币、钥匙等。此人如此漫不经心地对待价值五十金币的手表，我由此断定他是一个粗心的人，这并不是什么巨大的成就吧。这个人继承了一件如此贵重的物件，那么，他在其他方面也应该得到了很好的供养，这样的推断不算牵强吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a watch, to scratch the numbers of the ticket with a pinpoint upon the inside of the case. It is more handy than a label as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed. There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case. Inference -- that your brother was often at low water. Secondary inference -- that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could not have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner plate, which contains the key hole. Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole -- marks where the key has slipped. What sober man's key could have scored those grooves? But you will never see a drunkard's watch without them. He winds it at night, and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand. Where is the mystery in all this?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“英国当铺的惯例是，当他们收到一块手表时，就会用尖锐物把票据号码刻在表盖里。这比挂牌子更方便，可以免去牌子丢失或混乱的风险。用放大镜观察，可以看到，这里面起码有四个这样的号码。由此推断——你哥哥常常面临困窘的状况。进一步推断——他偶尔也会突然富一把，否则无法赎回手表。最后，我请你观察这个有钥匙孔的里盖。围绕着钥匙孔有上千条划痕——是钥匙划过的痕迹。清醒的人有可能划出这么多划痕吗？但在一个醉汉的表上，你却一定会看到这样的划痕。他晚上上弦，并留下了这些因手腕颤抖而造成的痕迹。这些推断里面有什么玄妙之处呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
