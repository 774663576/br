<div class="line_en">Each time that I opened my eyes to the morning light and realized I'd lived through another night was a surprise to me. After the surprise wore off, my heart would start to race and my palms would sweat; I couldn't really breathe again until I'd gotten up and ascertained that Charlie had survived as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">I could tell he was worried -- watching me jump at any loud sound, or my face suddenly go white for no reason that he could see. From the questions he asked now and then, he seemed to blame the change on Jacob's continued absence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The terror that was always foremost in my thoughts usually distracted me from the fact that another week had passed, and Jacob still hadn't called me. But when I was able to concentrate on my normal life -- if my life was really ever normal -- this upset me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐惧打消了我心里所有的念想，我几乎没有意识到一个星期又过去了，而雅各布还是没有给我打电话。当我的生活恢复正常——如果我的生活还算是正常的生活的话——这件事让我感到伤心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thursday I sat in my truck in front of my house -- with the locks pushed down -- keys in hand, for a solid hour. I was arguing with myself, trying to justify a quick trip to La Push, but I couldn't do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期四，我呆坐在门口的小卡车里——按下车栓——手里握着车钥匙，整整坐了一个小时。我艰难地作着思想斗争，想要说服自己开车去一趟拉普西，但是我不能这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd half expected him to call on Monday. If there had been some progress with Embry, wouldn't he want to report it? I wanted to believe that it was worry for his friend that was occupying all his time, not that he was just giving up on me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期一，我期待他打个电话过来。如果他与恩布里一切进展顺利的话，他是不是希望告诉我一声呢？我宁可相信他是为了朋友的事情忙碌操心，而不是有意疏远我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew that Laurent had gone back to Victoria by now. If I went to La Push, I took the chance of leading one of them there. What if they caught up to me when Jake was nearby? As much as it hurt me, I knew it was better for Jacob that he was avoiding me. Safer for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳伦特现在肯定回到维多利亚那里了。如果我去拉普西，我也许会把他们也引过去。如果杰克（雅各布）看到我被他们捉住怎么办？尽管看不到雅各布让我伤心不已，但是他离我越远就会越安全，这样想想，心里也就不那么难受了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was bad enough that I couldn't figure out a way to keep Charlie safe. Nighttime was the most likely time that they would come looking ior me, and what could I say to get Charlie out of the house? If I told him the truth, he'd have me locked up in a rubber room somewhere. I would have endured that -- welcomed it, even -- if it could have kept him safe. But Victoria would still come to his house first, looking for me. Maybe, if she found me here, that would be enough for her. Maybe she would just leave when she was done with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可惜我没办法保证查理的安全。夜晚是他们最有可能来寻找我的时刻，但是我要如何向查理解释才能让他离开屋子呢？如果我告诉他实情，他肯定会把我关在一个无人问津的地方。如果这样做能确保他的安全的话，我可以忍受，甚至欣然接受，但是维多利亚还是会先到家里来找我的。如果她在这里找到我，也许所有问题就此解决，她会在杀了我以后满足的离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, Charlie did me another favor and called Harry again to see if the Blacks were out of town. Harry reported that Billy had attended the council meeting Wednesday night, and never mentioned anything about leaving. Charlie warned me not to make a nuisance of myself -- Jacob would call when he got around to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，查理又帮了我一个忙。他给哈里打了个电话，询问布莱克一家是否搬出小镇了。哈里说比利星期三晚上还参加了会议，根本没有提离开的事情。查理让我不要自寻烦恼——雅各布如果有时间，一定会打电话过来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我埋怨自己没有早一些认识到这一点。当然，我最近的确心事重重——伺机报复的吸血鬼、巨型怪异的狼群，还有胸口的伤痛——但是，当我把所有的事情联系起来，一切都是那么显而易见，而我竟然到现在才发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't paying attention to the familiar road, letting the sound of the engine deaden my brain and silence the worries, when my subconscious delivered a verdict it must have been working on for some time without my knowledge.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Sam Uley. Even my nightmares had been trying to tell me that. Sam had gotten to Jacob. Whatever was happening to the other boys on the reservation had reached out and stolen my friend. He'd been sucked into Sam's cult.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是因为山姆·乌利，就连我的噩梦都曾暗示过这件事，是山姆·乌利改变了雅各布。发生在其他男孩儿身上的情形蔓延来来，如今正在影响我的朋友，他一定是卷入了山姆的小帮派。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been a week, and no vampires had come for me yet. A week was more than enough time for them to have returned, so I must not be a priority. Most likely, as I'd decided before, they would come for me at night. The chances of them following me to La Push were much lower than the chance of losing Jacob to Sam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去的一个星期里，还没有任何吸血鬼来找我。如果他们真的想取我的性命，绝不会等一个星期这么长的时间，所以我应该不必担心，更何况我认为他们只有在晚上才会出现。对比之下，失去雅各布的可能性远远大于吸血鬼跟踪我到拉普西的可能性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob had changed radically in the last weeks since I'd seen him. The first thing I noticed was his hair -- his beautiful hair was all gone, cropped quite short, covering his head with an inky gloss like black satin. The planes of his face seemed to have hardened subtly, tightened… aged. His neck and his shoulders were different, too, thicker somehow. His hands, where they gripped the window frame, looked enormous, with the tendons and veins more prominent under the russet skin. But the physical changes were insignificant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布在这几个星期里简直像变了一个人。我第一眼注意到的是他的头发——柔顺的头发全部剪掉了，一层短短的平头就像是盖在头上的深色缎子。脸上的线条僵硬、紧绷……看上去老了很多。他的颈和肩也有些不同，似乎比以前壮实了许多。他双手抓着窗框，手掌厚实宽大，筋腱和血管在深褐色的皮肤下清晰可见，但是，外表上的改变还不算明显。">查看中文翻译</div>

They could have been brothers -- I couldn't even pick Embry out of the group. The resemblance was only intensified by the strikingly similar hostility in every pair of eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我意识到他身边还有四个人，他们无一例外的都是高高的个头、深色的皮肤，黑发就像雅各布一样剃得短短的。他们就像是同胞兄弟——我甚至看不出哪一个是恩布里，眼光中的敌意使他们更加相似。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="让人感到陌生的是他的表情。那张开朗、友善的笑脸消失得无影无踪，以前温和的眼神变成了充满怨恨的仇视，令我无所适从。眼前的雅各布完全是一个阴郁的人，我的世界里的唯一一束阳光如今也被阴霾取代。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd thought Jake had been healing the hole in me -- or at least plugging it up, keeping it from hurting me so much. I'd been wrong. He'd just been carving out his own hole, so that I was now riddled through like Swiss cheese. I wondered why I didn't crumble into pieces.</div>

<div class="line_en">I jumped. When he spoke again, his voice was careful and lower.

No, Billy, I think she's right about this… Because I know my daughter, and if she says Jacob was scared before --" He was cut off mid-sentence, and when he answered he was almost shouting again.</div>

"If you think I'm going to remind her about that, then you had better think again. She's only just starting to get over it, and mostly because of Jacob, I think. If whatever Jacob has going on with this Sam character sends her back into that depression, then Jacob is going to have to answer to me. You're my friend, Billy, but this is hurting my family." There was another break for Billy to respond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说我不了解自己的女儿是什么意思！”他停了下来，听着电话那头的人说话，接着，他用我几乎听不到的声音说道：“你想让他回想起以前的事情，别做梦了。她刚刚熬过了所有的痛苦，我知道雅各布帮了不少忙。如果雅各布和山姆搞出了什么名堂让他又回到从前的样子，我绝对饶不了雅各布。你是我的朋友，比利。但是这件事伤害了我的家人。”他又停下来听比利说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I put my pajamas on and crawled into bed. Life seemed dark enough at the moment chat I let myself cheat. The hole -- holes now -- were already aching, so why not?

<div class="line_en">It was strange, for I'd feared that myself, but after the last thing Jacob had said this afternoon, I didn't believe it anymore.

<div class="line_en">I wasn't sure, when I woke in the dark, if I'd just begun crying, or if my tears had run while I slept and simply continued now. I stared at my dark ceiling. I could feel that it was the middle of the night -- I was still half-asleep, maybe more than half. I closed my eyes wearily and prayed for a dreamless sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a new dream tonight. Rain was falling and Jacob was walking soundlessly beside me, though beneath my feet the ground crunched like dry gravel. But he wasn't my Jacob; he was the new, bitter, graceful Jacob. The smooth suppleness of his walk reminded me of someone else, and, as I watched, his features started to change. The russet color of his skin leached away, leaving his face pale white like bone. His eyes turned gold, and then crimson, and then back to gold again. His shorn hair twisted in the breeze, turning bronze where the wind touched it. And his face became so beautiful that it shattered my heart. I reached for him, but he took a step away, raising his hands like a shield. And then Edward vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上我做了一个不同以往的梦。天下着雨，雅各布在我身边不声不响地走着，而我的脚步声却咯吱咯吱作响。他不是我的那个雅各布，这个雅各布有着陌生的模样，面露愁容。动作格外优雅、敏捷，他轻盈平稳的步态令我联想到另一个人。渐渐的，他的容貌开始改变，深褐色的皮肤褪了色，脸上毫无生气、苍白如骨；眼睛是金色的，一会儿又变成了血红色，一会儿又恢复成金色；头发缠绕在一起，在微风的吹拂下变成了青铜色。他的脸蛋十分俊俏，让我怦然心动。我朝他伸出手，他却向后退了一步，抬起了双手像盾牌一样挡住我。然后，爱德华就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
