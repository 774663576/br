<div class="line_en">George Osborne had brought Amelia to Brighton for a little honeymoon, and Joseph Sedley had come down to join them. And who should they discover, staying in the same hotel, but Captain and Mrs Rawdon Crawley? At once Rebecca and Amelia flew into each other's arms, and there was general delight among the young people. The two wedding parties met constantly, on excursions and at dinners, and the gentlemen for games of cards and billiards, which conveniently enabled Rawdon to refill his empty purse with his winnings from Jos and George.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Crawley, on whom all Rawdon's hopes depended, still refused to see him, and was now in Brighton, taking the sea air for her health. Her affectionate nephew and niece had followed her there, but Miss Crawley was guarded day and night by the fiercely possessive Mrs Bute Crawley, who was determined to prevent Rawdon inheriting any of his aunt's riches. Becky and Rawdon, however, were just as determined to succeed as Mrs Bute; and in the meantime they spent money freely and ran up debts, confident of getting the old lady's money in the end.</div>

<div class="line_en">On meeting George Osborne again, Becky had taken some care to be especially charming to him, admiring his handsome face and his skill at billiards (at which he usually lost to Rawdon). In return, George thought Becky clever, amusing, stylish, and altogether delightful. He quite forgot his original opinion of her as a lowly governess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再见到乔治·奥斯本时，贝姬刻意对他施展魅力，奉承他仪表堂堂，球技高超（打台球时，他通常会输给罗顿）。相应地，乔治觉得贝姬聪明、风趣又时髦，总而言之，很讨人喜欢。他完全忘了以前认为她是个地位低下的家庭教师的评价了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two young couples had plenty to tell each other, and their marriages and future hopes were discussed with great interest on both sides.

<div class="line_en">Becky laughed. "Do you know what my plan is?" she said. "You remember Briggs, my Aunt Crawley's companion? She goes sea-bathing a lot, and one day I'm going to dive in next to her and insist on immediate forgiveness, right there in the water."</div>

<div class="line_en">And so she did, leaning over his shoulder to correct his spelling and grammar. The letter was in short, soldierly sentences, full of grateful affection, and made no mention of money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一边说，一边俯身探过他的肩头，纠正他的拼写和语法错误。信里都是短句子，语气像军人般简捷，满是感恩之情，而且压根没提钱的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Rawdon never wrote a word of that letter," she said. "He never wrote to me without asking for money in his life, and all his letters are full of bad spelling and bad grammar. It's that little snake of a governess who rules him." They are all the same, Miss Crawley thought in her heart. They all want me dead, and are hoping for my money. I wish they would all leave me alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“信绝不是罗顿写的。”她说，“他给我写信从来都是要钱，而且他的信错字连篇，语法也不通。一定是那个家庭教师小蛇精写的，她把罗顿完全掌控住了。”克劳利小姐心想，他们都是一丘之貉，盼着我死，惦着我的钱。我真希望他们离我远远的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She did agree to meet Rawdon briefly, but the interview was not a success, and that evening Rawdon received a letter from his aunt.

<div class="line_en">But George did not care. The old man would forgive him in the end, he thought, and as his army pay had gone in gambling losses to Captain Crawley, he began to spend his two thousand pounds.

<div class="line_en">Amelia happily obeyed her husband's orders about shopping, but was a little sad when he would not go with her to visit her parents. Mrs Sedley wept with happiness to see her daughter, and Amelia found it oddly comforting to be with her kind old parents again. Only nine days married, and so much had changed! Did she admit to herself how different the real man was from that handsome hero she had adored before marriage? No, a man must be very bad indeed before a woman will admit such a thing, and whatever secret disappointments lay in that gentle heart, they stayed well hidden from the world.</div>
