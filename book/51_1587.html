<div class="line_en">Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he empties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night.</div>

<div class="line_en">I automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before I realize that's over. At least for a while. I can't very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground. I left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched -- how could I conceal it? -- and we're a scant fifty yards downstream. I put on my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle down to keep watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不由自主目光环视四周，希望找到休憩的理想大树，但旋即意识到这已经成为过去。至少在一段时间内，我不能在皮塔无人看护的情况下，把他一个人留在地面。我离开皮塔原来岸上的藏身地时没有把痕迹消除，我该怎么隐藏一下呢？我们现在距那里不足五十码远。我戴上眼镜，把武器准备好，坐下来，观察着四周。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The temperature drops rapidly and soon I'm chilled to the bone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta. It's toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I realize it's more than warm, it's overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever. I check his forehead and find it burning and dry. I don't know what to do. Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the fever? Take him out and hope the night air cools him off? I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. It seems weak, but I'm afraid to do anything too drastic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温度很快下降，我不久就感到彻骨的寒冷。最后，我顶不住了，爬进皮塔的睡袋。睡袋里既暖和又舒适，我蜷缩在皮塔身边，但我很快意识到这不是暖和而是烫，因为睡袋反射了皮塔的体温。我摸了下他的前额，滚烫干燥，我不知该如何是好。让他待在睡袋里，让里面的高温帮他退烧？还是让他出来，让夜晚凉爽的空气帮他退烧？我最后决定只把一块绷带浸湿，给他敷在额头上，这不起太大作用，可我怕别的方法效果更糟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him, I've made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured. And still I came after him. I'm just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我整晚待在皮塔身边，时而坐着，时而躺下，不停地给他换绷带，克制自己不要去想跟他搭伙我要比原来更易受到攻击。我现在的活动范围在地面上，要时时提防，还要照顾病人。我明知他受了伤，还是找到了他，无论当时是何种本能驱使我去找他，我必须坚信这个决定是正确的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on Peeta's lip and discover the fever has broken. He's not back to normal, but it's come down a few degrees. Last night, when I was gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rue's berries. I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water.</div>

Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained on the world outside. "Go to sleep," he says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting. I don't want him to stop and he doesn't. He's still stroking my hair when I fall asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，睡袋里太热了。我把它铺在地上，躺下来，一手抓着弓箭以防万一紧急情况出现。皮塔靠着洞壁，坐在我身边，他受伤的腿伸到前面，眼睛看着外面。“睡吧。”他轻柔地说。他用手把我额头上几缕垂落的头发捋到脑后。与舞台上造作的拥吻不同，他的动作自然，让人感觉很舒服。我不想让他停下来，他也没停。他还在抚弄着我的头发，我已沉沉睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My heart drops into my stomach. It's worse, much worse. There's no more pus in evidence, but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment won't make a dent in it. We'll need strong anti-infection drugs from the Capitol. I can't imagine the cost of such potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伤口更糟了，我的心往下一沉，已经没有明显的脓水，可发炎的腿肿得更厉害了，绷得皮肤亮晶晶的，我看到红线上移到他腿根，这是血液中的毒素，不赶快救治，他肯定会死。我嚼的草药和烫伤膏根本无济于事，我们需要凯匹特送来强效抗生素。我想象不出这种药要花多少钱，如果黑密斯把所有的赞助款合在一起，是不是够用呢？我怀疑。礼物的价格随着比赛进行而不断攀升。第一天能买一顿饭的钱，到了第十二天只能买一块饼干。而皮塔需要的那种药从一开始就很稀缺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. That's when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims he's been drinking, but the containers still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, which are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap the leg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这里，我又皱起眉头，皮塔咧开嘴笑起来。这时我才发现他的嘴有多干，我摸摸他的脸颊，像煤炉一样烫。他说他一直在喝水，可瓶里好像还挺满的。我给他吃了些退烧药，站在他身旁看他喝下一夸脱水，然后又喝下一夸脱水。之后我处理了一下他较轻的伤口，已经好些了，之后我定定神，给他打开了腿上的绷带。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We'll see," I say. As I take the pot down to the stream, I'm struck by how brutally hot it is. I swear the Gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked stones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe I won't need to light a fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们看看吧。”我说。我把锅拿到溪边时，发现天奇热无比。我敢肯定大赛组织者一直在提高白天的温度，而猛降夜间温度。然而，溪边烤得发热的石头让我有了个主意，也许我不用生火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of water, I place it in direct sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the water. I'm the first to admit I'm not much of a cook. But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, it's one of my better dishes. I mince groosling until it's practically mush and mash some of Rue's roots. Fortunately, they've both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up. Already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the water's warm. I put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find something green to spice it up a little. Before long, I discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. Perfect. I chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在洞穴和溪流之间有一块平平的大石头，我在上面处理了一下，把半锅水消好毒，然后放在直射的阳光之下，在水里扔一下几块烤热的鹅卵石。应该说我不是个好厨子，可做汤只需把东西扔进去，等着锅开了就行了，所以汤是我做得比较好的。我把鸟肉撕碎，之后弄碎露露摘的植物根。还好，两种东西都是熟的，只要加热一下。在阳光和热石头的双重作用下，锅里的水已经热了。我把肉和植物根放进锅里，不停地换石头，然后再找些绿色野菜调剂下颜色，没多久，我在石头底下找到了些野葱，不错。我把野葱弄得碎碎的，放在锅里，又换块石头，盖上锅盖，让所有的东西在锅里焖一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

I wonder about the other tributes, how they're managing now that their main source of food has been blown up. At least three of them, Cato, Clove, and Foxface, had been relying on it. Probably not Thresh though. I've got a feeling he must share some of Rue's knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they fighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea sends me back to the cave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here's the real story of how I got the money for Prim's goat, Lady. It was a Friday evening, the day before Prim's tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and I hit the woods, because I wanted to get enough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens, but this was really no more than our average Friday-night haul. I was disappointed as we headed back, even though Gale said we'd be sure to do better tomorrow. We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A young buck, probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是真事，我怎么得到钱，给波丽姆买羊。那是一个星期五的下午，波丽姆五月份生日的前一天。学校一放学，我和盖尔就到林子里打猎，因为我想攒够钱给波丽姆买礼物。也许买些布做条新裙子，或者发刷什么的。我们在林子里下了很多套，林子里一片绿油油的，可那晚捕到的猎物也不比平常多。我在回家的路上感到很沮丧，就算盖尔不断安慰我说明天肯定比今天强也无济于事。我们在小溪边休息的时候我看到了它——一头年幼的公鹿，按鹿的年龄大概也就一岁吧，它的角刚长出来，上面还带着绒毛。它站起身来准备跑掉，却又不肯定，毕竟它和人类并不熟悉。这头鹿很美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta shakes his head, and looks at me expectantly. So I begin. But carefully. Because my words are going out all over Panem. And while people have no doubt put two and two together that I hunt illegally, I don't want to hurt Gale or Greasy Sae or the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing they're breaking the law, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔摇摇头，用期待的眼神看着我。我开始讲起了故事。我讲得很小心，因为我的话整个帕纳姆都听得到，显然我们在林中打猎是违法的，我不愿伤害盖尔、格雷茜·塞、屠夫、甚至治安警，因为他们也买肉吃，这是显而易见的。">查看中文翻译</div>

She gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but it's a fair price. We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the butchering.

There's an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam. I don't know his real name, everyone just calls him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles, and he's got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines. But he's lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. He's filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it.</div>

He's gotten the medicine -- I don't know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels -- and I can save Peeta! It's such a tiny vial though. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There's no question, it's sleep syrup. It's a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyone's had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day, but what good is that? I'm so furious I'm about to throw Haymitch's last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full day? That's more than I need.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想得出神，降落伞落到我身边我差点没看见。我跳起来去拿降落伞，从水里把它拖出来，撕掉外面的银色包装纸，看到里面有个小瓶。黑密斯成功了！他拿到了药品——我不知道他怎么拿到的，也许他劝说一群满脑子浪漫故事的呆子卖掉了她们的珠宝——我能去救皮塔了！这个小药瓶那么小，一定对皮塔的伤口很有效。但，旋即我心中产生了一丝怀疑，拧开盖，使劲闻了一下，一股浓浓甜昧差点让我晕过去。为了确定是什么药，我用舌尖舔了一下，没错，是安眠糖浆，这是十二区的一种普通药物，我妈妈常给疼得大喊的病人一以便给严重的伤口缝针，或者使某些病人镇静，或者帮疼痛的人入睡。一小瓶这样的药能让皮塔昏睡一整天，这有什么用？我气得刚要把黑密斯的礼物扔到小溪里，突然想起来一件事，一整天？这时间对我来说足够了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I mash up a handful of berries so the taste won't be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I head back up to the cave. "I've brought you a treat. I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我捣碎了一把浆果和在里面，这样就闻不出来了，为保险又加了些薄荷叶子，然后走到洞口。“我又给你带来好吃的了，在溪流下游我找到了些浆果。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he says, almost puzzled. "But they taste familiar. Sugar berries?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“晤，没有，”他说着，一脸的迷惑，“可这味道很熟悉，是叫砂糖果吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. "They're very sweet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔毫不犹豫就吃了第一口，再吃第二口时微微皱起眉头。“浆果很甜啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, they're sugar berries. My mother makes jam from them. Haven't you ever had them before?" I say, poking the next spoonful in his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，这是砂糖果，我妈妈常用它做果酱，难道你以前没吃过吗？”我说，又往他嘴里塞了一勺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, you can't get them in the market much, they only grow wild," I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，在市场不常买到，它是野生的。”我说。又给了一勺，就剩最后一勺了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They're sweet as syrup," he says, taking the last spoonful. "Syrup." His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but it's too late, he's already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, I can see in his eyes what I've done is unforgivable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“跟糖浆一样甜。”他说着，正要吃下最后一口，“是糖浆。”他知道了，眼睛睁得大大的。我用手紧紧捂住他的嘴和鼻子，迫使他吞下最后一口。他想把东西呕出来，但是太晚了，他大脑已迷糊不清了。就在他快要昏睡过去时，眼神仍透出责备，仿佛在说我的所作所为是多么不可原谅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away. "Who can't lie, Peeta?" I say, even though he can't hear me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在自己的后脚跟上，蹲在他面前，眼睛看着他，心里忧喜参半。一颗浆果掉在他的下巴上，我把它擦掉。“谁说我不会撒谎，皮塔？”我说道，虽然他此时已听不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
