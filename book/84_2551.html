<div class="line_en">Shawn was in a mood. He sat on a bench at the table, watching me gather the bottles and hide them. I'd washed Mother's china, which had never been used, and I began laying it out, eyeing the distance between each plate and knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩心情不错。他坐在桌旁的长椅上，看着我将瓶瓶罐罐收好。我把母亲从未用过的瓷制餐具洗净摆好，检查每个盘子和餐刀之间的距离。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shawn turned me onto my back and sat on my stomach, pinning my arms at my sides with his knees. The shock of his weight forced the breath from my chest. He pressed his forearm into my windpipe. I sputtered, trying to gulp enough air to shout, but the airway was blocked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩将我按在地上，坐在我的肚子上，用他的膝盖夹住我的胳膊。他的体重让我透不过气来。他用前臂勒住我的气管。我气急败坏，想大口大口地喘气喊叫，但呼吸道被堵住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I fetched glasses. When I put one in front of him, Shawn jabbed a finger into my ribs, digging hard. "Don't touch me!" I shrieked. Then the room turned upside down. My feet were knocked out from under me and I was swept into the living room, just out of Mother's sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拿来玻璃杯。当我把一个杯子摆在肖恩面前时，他用一根手指狠狠地戳了一下我的肋骨。“别碰我！”我尖叫道。接着房间翻了个底朝天。他将我打倒，拎着我的脚，拖到起居室，远离母亲的视线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn said this loudly, he almost shouted it. He was saying it to me, but he was not saying it for me. He was saying it for Mother, to define the moment: I was a misbehaving child; he was setting the child right. The pressure on my windpipe eased and I felt a delicious fullness in my lungs. He knew I would not call out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩说得很大声，几乎是喊出来的。他对着我说，但不是说给我听，而是说给母亲听：我是个行为不端的孩子，他是在纠正孩子的错误。气管上的压力减轻了，我感到肺部有一种美妙的充盈感。他知道我不会叫出声来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I folded napkins from paper towels and put one at each setting. When I placed one at Shawn's plate, he again jabbed his finger into my ribs. I said nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从纸巾盒里拿出餐巾纸一一折好，在每一套餐具上都放上一张。当我把一张餐巾纸摆到肖恩的盘子里时，他又一次用手指戳我的肋骨。我什么也没说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yelling is rude," Shawn said, again speaking to the kitchen. "You'll stay down until you apologize." I said I was sorry for yelling at him. A moment later I was standing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charles arrived early -- Dad hadn't even come in from the junkyard yet -- and sat at the table across from Shawn, who glared at him, never blinking. I didn't want to leave them alone together, but Mother needed help with the cooking, so I returned to the stove but devised small errands to bring me back to the table. On one of those trips I heard Shawn telling Charles about his guns, and on another, about all the ways he could kill a man. I laughed loudly at both, hoping Charles would think they were jokes. The third time I returned to the table, Shawn pulled me onto his lap. I laughed at that, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查尔斯到得很早——爸爸还没从废料场回来——他在餐桌前坐下，对面的肖恩眼睛一眨不眨地怒视着他。我不想让他俩单独待在一起，但母亲需要我帮忙做饭，所以我来到炉灶边，但一再找借口回到餐桌旁。一次回到餐桌时，我听见肖恩对查尔斯谈论他的枪；另一次，我听到肖恩谈论他知道的杀人的所有方法。两次我都哈哈大笑，希望查尔斯认为它们只是玩笑话。第三次回到餐桌时，肖恩把我拉到他腿上坐下。我也笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你为什么这么做？”我喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The charade couldn't last, not even until supper. I passed Shawn carrying a large china plate of dinner rolls, and he stabbed my gut so hard it knocked the wind out of me. I dropped the plate. It shattered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种装模作样的把戏并未持续多久，甚至没撑到晚饭时间。我端着一大瓷盘小圆面包从肖恩身边走过，他又狠狠地捅了我一下，疼得我喘不过气来。手中的盘子掉在地上，摔碎了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It happened so quickly, I don't know how he got me to the floor, but again I was on my back and he was on top of me. He demanded that I apologize for breaking the plate. I whispered the apology, quietly, so Charles wouldn't hear, but this enraged Shawn. He grabbed a fistful of my hair, again near the scalp, for leverage, and yanked me upright, then dragged me toward the bathroom. The movement was so abrupt, Charles had no time to react. The last thing I saw as my head hurled down the hall was Charles leaping to his feet, eyes wide, face pale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情发生得太突然，我不知道他是怎么把我弄到地板上的，但我再一次仰面躺着，被他压在身下。他让我为打碎盘子道歉。为了不让查尔斯听见，我悄悄地轻声道歉，所以肖恩没听见，被激怒了。他一把抓住我的头发，又一次贴近头皮作为杠杆，将我猛拉起来，然后把我拖向卫生间。一切发生得如此突然，查尔斯都没来得及反应。当我被揪着头拖拽在走廊里时，我所见的最后一幕，便是查尔斯跳了起来，眼睛大睁，脸色苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My wrist was folded, my arm twisted behind my back. My head was shoved into the toilet so that my nose hovered above the water. Shawn was yelling something but I didn't hear what. I was listening for the sound of footsteps in the hall, and when I heard them I became deranged. Charles could not see me like this. He could not know that for all my pretenses -- my makeup, my new clothes, my china place settings -- this is who I was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的手腕交叉着，胳膊被扭在身后。我的头被塞进马桶，鼻子悬在水面上。肖恩对我喊着什么，但我什么也没听见。我在听走廊里的脚步声，一听到它们我就抓狂。不能让查尔斯看见我这个样子。不能让他看出我所有的伪装——我的化妆品，我的新衣服，我的瓷制餐具——这才是我真正的面目。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I convulsed, arching my body and ripping my wrist away from Shawn. I'd caught him off guard; I was stronger than he'd expected, or maybe just more reckless, and he lost his hold. I sprang for the door. I'd made it through the frame and had taken a step into the hallway when my head shot backward. Shawn had caught me by the hair, and he yanked me toward him with such force that we both tumbled back and into the bathtub.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我抽搐着，拱起身子，奋力将手腕从肖恩手中挣脱。我让他猝不及防；我比他想象的力气更大，或者也许只是更鲁莽，他没能抓住我。我扑向门口。我刚穿过门框，一脚踏进走廊，突然头向后一仰，又被肖恩一把抓住头发。他用力将我拽向他，于是我们又跌回浴缸里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course I am! Shawn is so, so, so -- funny." My voice strangled on the last word as I put weight on my foot and a wave of pain swept through me. Charles tried to carry me but I pushed him off and walked on the break, grinding my teeth to stop myself from crying out, while I slapped playfully at my brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然还好！肖恩是多么，多么，多么——搞笑啊。”随着我将重心挪到脚上，一阵疼痛掠过全身，我在说最后一个词时声音都哽咽了。查尔斯想把我抱走，但我推开他，一瘸一拐地走着，咬紧牙关不让自己哭出声来，还开玩笑似的拍了哥哥一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next thing I remember, Charles was lifting me and I was laughing -- a shrill, demented howl. I thought if I could just laugh loudly enough, the situation might still be saved, that Charles might yet be convinced it was all a joke. Tears streamed from my eyes -- my big toe was broken -- but I kept cackling. Shawn stood in the doorway looking awkward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得的下一幕是，查尔斯抱起我，我大笑着，发出一声尖锐而疯狂的号叫。我想，如果我能大声笑出来，也许情况还有救，也许还能说服查尔斯这一切不过是个玩笑。泪水从我的眼睛里流了出来——我的大脚趾断了——但我一直咯咯地笑。肖恩站在门口，面露尴尬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Charles didn't stay for supper. He fled to his jeep and I didn't hear from him for several hours, then he called and asked me to meet him at the church. He wouldn't come to Buck's Peak. We sat in his jeep in the dark, empty parking lot. He was crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查尔斯没有留下来吃晚饭。他逃进他的吉普车，我好几个小时都没听到他的消息，后来他打电话让我去教堂跟他见面。他不会再来巴克峰。在漆黑空旷的停车场，我们坐在他的吉普车里。他在哭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If someone had asked me, I'd have said Charles was the most important thing in the world to me. But he wasn't. And I would prove it to him.

<div class="line_en">I became erratic, demanding, hostile. I devised a bizarre and ever-evolving rubric by which I measured his love for me, and when he failed to meet it, I became paranoid. I surrendered to rages, venting all my savage anger, every fearful resentment I'd ever felt toward Dad or Shawn, at him, this bewildered bystander who'd only ever helped me. When we argued, I screamed that I never wanted to see him again, and I screamed it so many times that one night, when I called to change my mind, like I always did, he wouldn't let me.</div>

<div class="line_en">We met one final time, in a field off the highway. Buck's Peak loomed over us. He said he loved me but this was over his head. He couldn't save me. Only I could.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winter covered campus in thick snow. I stayed indoors, memorizing algebraic equations, trying to live as I had before -- to imagine my life at the university as disconnected from my life on Buck's Peak. The wall separating the two had been impregnable. Charles was a hole in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬天的校园被厚厚的积雪覆盖。我待在室内背诵代数公式，努力像以前一样生活——想象我的大学生活与巴克峰的生活完全分开。将两者分开的那堵墙原本坚不可摧，但查尔斯是其中的一个漏洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The stomach ulcers returned, burning and aching through the night. Once, I awoke to Robin shaking me. She said I'd been shouting in my sleep. I touched my face and it was wet. She wrapped me in her arms so tight I felt cocooned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胃溃疡复发了，整夜又烧又痛。有一次，罗宾将我摇醒。她说我在睡梦中一直大喊大叫。我摸了摸我的脸，是湿的。她把我紧紧搂在怀里，让我感到被包裹得严严实实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had no idea what he was talking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道他在说什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shrugged. She assumed my mother had, and I let her believe it. The truth was, the morning after Thanksgiving, I had asked Shawn to tell me if it was broken. He'd knelt on the kitchen floor and I'd dropped my foot into his lap. In that posture he seemed to shrink. He examined the toe for a moment, then he looked up at me and I saw something in his blue eyes. I thought he was about to say he was sorry, but just when I expected his lips to part he grasped the tip of my toe and yanked. It felt as if my foot had exploded, so intense was the shock that shot through my leg. I was still trying to swallow spasms of pain when Shawn stood, put a hand on my shoulder and said, "Sorry, Siddle Lister, but it hurts less if you don't see it coming."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我耸了耸肩。她以为是我母亲治的，我让她相信了。事实是，感恩节后的那天早上，我让肖恩看看我的大脚趾是否断了。他跪在厨房的地板上，我把脚放在他膝盖上。这个姿势让他看上去缩小了。他检查了一会儿脚趾，然后抬头看着我，从他的蓝眼睛里我看出了一些东西。我以为他要向我道歉，但就在我期待他开口时，他抓住我的脚趾尖，猛地一拉。我感觉脚好像炸裂一般，一阵剧痛传遍整条腿。我仍旧强忍着疼痛，这时肖恩站起身，将一只手放在我肩膀上，说：“对不起，小妹，但就是要趁你不注意，才不会那么痛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning, Robin asked me to go with her to a doctor -- for the ulcers but also for an X-ray of my foot, because my big toe had turned black. I said I didn't need a doctor. The ulcers would heal, and someone had already treated the toe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after, I found a pamphlet for the university counseling service on my desk. I barely looked at it, just knocked it into the trash. I could not see a counselor. To see one would be to ask for help, and I believed myself invincible. It was an elegant deception, a mental pirouette. The toe was not broken because it was not breakable. Only an X-ray could prove otherwise. Thus, the X-ray would break my toe.</div>

Richard would move the world. Shawn would not. He'd lost too much of his mind when he'd fallen off that pallet. One of my father's sons would be driving the forklift for the rest of his life, but it wouldn't be Richard.</div>

I pass through the main lot and turn into the open asphalt on the north side of the store, where employees park.

I do not use vague, shadowy language, as I have done in other entries; I do not hide behind hints and suggestion. I write what I remember: There was one point when he was forcing me from the car, that he had both hands pinned above my head and my shirt rose up. I asked him to let me fix it but it was like he couldn't hear me. He just stared at it like a great big jerk. It's a good thing I'm as small as I am.

I look down at my white stomach, then up at my brother. His expression is unforgettable: not anger or rage. There is no fury in it. Only pleasure, unperturbed.

There was a boldness in not editing for consistency, in not ripping out either the one page or the other. To admit uncertainty is to admit to weakness, to powerlessness, and to believe in yourself despite both. It is a frailty, but in this frailty there is a strength: the conviction to live in your own mind, and not in someone else's.
