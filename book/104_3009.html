<div class="line_en">It was then that began our extensive travels all over the States. To any other type of tourist accommodation I soon grew to prefer the Functional Motel -- clean, neat, safe nooks, ideal places for sleep, argument, reconciliation, insatiable illicit love. At first, in my dread of arousing suspicion, I would eagerly pay for both sections of one double unit, each containing a double bed. I wondered what type of foursome this arrangement was ever intended for, since only a pharisaic parody of privacy could be attained by means of the incomplete partition dividing the cabin or room into two communicating love nests. By and by, the very possibilities that such honest promiscuity suggested (two young couples merrily swapping mates or a child shamming sleep to earwitness primal sonorities) made me bolder, and every now and then I would take a bed-and-cot or twin-bed cabin, a prison cell of paradise, with yellow window shades pulled down to create a morning illusion of Venice and sunshine when actually it was Pennsylvania and rain.</div>

<div class="line_en">We came to know -- nous connûmes, to use a Flaubertian intonation -- the stone cottages under enormous Chateaubriandesque trees, the brick unit, the adobe unit, the stucco court, on what the Tour Book of the Automobile Association describes as "shaded" or "spacious" or "landscaped" grounds. The log kind, finished in knotty pine, reminded Lo, by its golden-brown glaze, of fried-chicken bones. We held in contempt the plain whitewashed clapboard Kabins, with their faint sewerish smell or some other gloomy self-conscious stench and nothing to boast of (except "good beds"), and an unsmiling landlady always prepared to have her gift ("… well, I could give you…") turned down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nous connûmes (this is royal fun) the would-be enticements of their repetitious names -- all those Sunset Motels, U-Beam Cottages, Hillcrest Courts, Pine View Courts, Mountain View Courts, Skyline Courts, Park Plaza Courts, Green Acres, Mac's Courts. There was sometimes a special line in the write-up, such as "Children welcome, pets allowed" (You are welcome, you are allowed). The baths were mostly tiled showers, with an endless variety of spouting mechanisms, but with one definitely non-Laodicean characteristic in common, a propensity, while in use, to turn instantly beastly hot or blindingly cold upon you, depending on whether your neighbor turned on his cold or his hot to deprive you of a necessary complement in the shower you had so carefully blended. Some motels had instructions pasted above the toilet (on whose tank the towels were un-hygienically heaped) asking guests not to throw into its bowl garbage, beer cans, cartons, stillborn babies; others had special notices under glass, such as Things to Do (Riding: You will often see riders coming down Main Street on their way back from a romantic moonlight ride.

<div class="line_en">Nous connûmes the various types of motor court operators, the reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop, among the males; and the motherly, pseudo-ladylike and madamic variants among the females.

<div class="line_en">We avoided Tourist Homes, country cousins of Funeral ones, old-fashioned, genteel and showerless, with elaborate dressing tables in depressingly white-and-pink little bedrooms, and photographs of the landlady's children in all their instars. But I did surrender, now and then, to Lo's predilection for "real" hotels. She would pick out in the book, while I petted her in the parked car in the silence of a dusk-mellowed, mysterious side-road, some highly recommended lake lodge which offered all sorts of things magnified by the flashlight she moved over them, such as congenial company, between-meals snacks, outdoor barbecues -- but which in my mind conjured up odious visions of stinking high school boys in sweatshirts and an ember-red cheek pressing against hers, while poor Dr. Humbert, embracing nothing but two masculine knees, would cold-humor his piles on the damp turf. Most tempting to her, too, were those "Colonial" Inns, which apart from "gracious atmosphere" and picture windows, promised "unlimited quantities of M-m-m food." Treasured recollections of my father's palatial hotel sometimes led me to seek for its like in the strange country we traveled through. I was soon discouraged; but Lo kept following the scent of rich food ads, while I derived a not exclusively economic kick from such roadside signs as TIMBER HOTEL, Children under 14 Free. On the other hand, I shudder when recalling that soi-disant "high-class" resort in a Midwestern state, which advertised "raid-the-icebox" midnight snacks and, intrigued by my accent, wanted to know my dead wife's and dead mother's maiden names. A two-days' stay there cost me a hundred and twenty-four dollars! And do you remember, Miranda, that other "ultrasmart" robbers' den with complimentary morning coffee and circulating ice water, and no children under sixteen (no Lolitas, of course)?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们躲开了“旅行者之家”，那种乡间丧屋似的地方，样式陈旧，倒还雅致，无淋浴设备，粉白色的闷热卧室里摆设着精致的梳妆台，以及女房东的孩子们各个蜕变期的照片。不过我还是常常向洛对“真正”旅馆的偏爱做出妥协。当车停在一条黄昏醇厚、神秘的岔路上，四下一片静谧，我在车中抚爱她时，她就会挑出书上极力推荐的湖滨公寓，那里一切条件齐备，诸如情意相投的侣伴、饭间点心，以及露天野营，这一切又被她驶上前去的车灯照得通亮——但在我，却只想见到一幅可僧的图景，一群穿着汗津津短裤的高年级男生，用红得象燃烧的煤屑的脸紧贴着她的，而可怜的亨伯特博士除了她一双健壮的膝盖便再没什么可拥抱的，只好冷静地在潮湿的草地上迁就他的痔疮。最诱惑她的还有“殖民地’酒店”，除情调优雅、风景如画外，还保证备有“不加限量的早一中一夜三餐”。我父亲宫殿似的饮店给予我的宝贵回忆，有时也使我欲想在游历的这个奇异国度寻找一家与其相媲者。但我很快就失望了；只是洛仍不停追踪食品广告的香味，我则从路边诸如“森林旅馆’，十四岁以下儿童免费”这类招牌上获得了一种利他的经济刺激。另一方面，每当想起中西部某州的一个自诩“上流”的旅馆，我便禁不住颤栗，它用广告宣传被喻为“冰箱清洗”的午夜点心，还因为我的口音使他们很感兴趣，便问起我的亡妻、和亡母的仆人的名字。在那儿呆了两天，竟花了我一百二十四美元！你还记得，米兰达，另外那个“顶大”的、附有晨咖啡和循环冰水，又没有十六岁以下儿童（没有洛丽塔们，当然）的强盗窝吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A combination of naïveté and deception, of charm and vulgarity, of blue sulks and rosy mirth, Lolita, when she chose, could be a most exasperating brat. I was not really quite prepared for her fits of disorganized boredom, intense and vehement griping, her sprawling, droopy, dopey-eyed style, and what is called goofing off -- a kind of diffused clowning which she thought was tough in a boyish hoodlum way. Mentally, I found her to be a disgustingly conventional little girl. Sweet hot jazz, square dancing, gooey fudge sundaes, musicals, movie magazines and so forth -- these were the obvious items in her list of beloved things. The Lord knows how many nickels I fed to the gorgeous music boxes that came with every meal we had! I still hear the nasal voices of those invisibles serenading her, people with names like Sammy and Jo and Eddy and Tony and Peggy and Guy and Patty and Rex, and sentimental song hits, all of them as similar to my ear as her various candies were to my palate. She believed, with a kind of celestial trust, any advertisement or advice that appeared in Movie Love or Screen Land -- Starasil Starves Pimples, or "You better watch out if you're wearing your shirttails outside your jeans, gals, because Jill says you shouldn't." If a roadside sign said: VISIT OUR GIFT SHOP -- we had to visit it, had to buy its Indian curios, dolls, copper jewelry, cactus candy. The words "novelties and souvenirs" simply entranced her by their trochaic lilt. If some cafe sign proclaimed Icecold Drinks, she was automatically stirred, although all drinks everywhere were ice-cold. She it was to whom ads were dedicated: the ideal consumer, the subject and object of every foul poster. And she attempted -- unsuccessfully -- to patronize only those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads.</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately upon arrival at one of the plainer motor courts which became our habitual haunts, she would set the electric fan a-whirr, or induce me to drop a quarter into the radio, or she would read all the signs and inquire with a whine why she could not go riding up some advertised trail or swimming in that local pool of warm mineral water. Most often, in the slouching, bored way she cultivated, Lo would fall prostrate and abominably desirable into a red springchair or a green chaise longue, or a steamer chair of striped canvas with footrest and canopy, or a sling chair, or any other lawn chair under a garden umbrella on the patio, and it would take hours of blandishments, threats and promises to make her lend me for a few seconds her brown limbs in the seclusion of the five-dollar room before undertaking anything she might prefer to my poor joy.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few years before, she had spent a rainy summer under Miss Phalen's bleary eye in a dilapidated Appalachian farmhouse that had belonged to some gnarled Haze or other in the dead past. It still stood among its rank acres of golden rod on the edge of a flowerless forest, at the end of a permanently muddy road, twenty miles from the nearest hamlet. Lo recalled that scarecrow of a house, the solitude, the soggy old pastures, the wind, the bloated wilderness, with an energy of disgust that distorted her mouth and fattened her half-revealed tongue. And it was there that I warned her she would dwell with me in exile for months and years if need be, studying under me French and Latin, unless her "present attitude" changed.

She feels in him the forerunner of the desired elusive male ('elusive' is good, by Polonius!). The wise mother (and your poor mother would have been wise, had she lived) will encourage a companionship between father and daughter, realizing -- excuse the corny style -- that the girl forms her ideals of romance and of men from her association with her father. Now, what association does this cheery book mean -- and recommend? I quote again: Among Sicilians sexual relations between a father and his daughter are accepted as a matter of course, and the girl who participates in such relationship is not looked upon with disapproval by the society of which she is part. I'm a great admirer of Sicilians, fine athletes, fine musicians, fine upright people, Lo, and great lovers. But let's not digress. Only the other day we read in the newspapers some bunkum about a middle-aged morals offender who pleaded guilty to the violation of the Mann Act and to transporting a nine-year-old girl across state lines for immoral purposes, whatever these are.</div>

So I go to jail. Okay. I go to jail. But what happens to you, my orphan? Well, you are luckier. You become the ward of the Department of Public Welfare -- which I am afraid sounds a little bleak. A nice grim matron of the Miss Phalen type, but more rigid and not a drinking woman, will take away your lipstick and fancy clothes. No more gadding about! I don't know if you have ever heard of the laws relating to dependent, neglected, incorrigible and delinquent children. While I stand gripping the bars, you, happy neglected child, will be given a choice of various dwelling places, all more or less the same, the correctional school, the reformatory, the juvenile detention home, or one of those admirable girls' protectories where you knit things, and sing hymns, and have rancid pancakes on Sundays. You will go there, Lolita -- my Lolita, this Lolita will leave her Catullus and go there, as the wayward girl you are. In plainer words, if we two are found out, you will be analyzed and institutionalized, my pet, c'est tout. You will dwell, my Lolita will dwell (come here, my brown flower) with thirty-nine other dopes in a dirty dormitory (no, allow me, please) under the supervision of hideous matrons. This is the situation, this is the choice. Don't you think that under the circumstances Dolores Haze had better stick to her old man?"</div>

<div class="line_en">By rubbing all this in, I succeeded in terrorizing Lo, who despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her I. Q. might suggest. But if I managed to establish that background of shared secrecy and shared guilt, I was much less successful in keeping her in good humor. Every morning during our yearlong travels I had to devise some expectation, some special point in space and time for her to look forward to, for her to survive till bedtime. Otherwise, deprived of a shaping and sustaining purpose, the skeleton of her day sagged and collapsed. The object in view might be anything -- a lighthouse in Virginia, a natural cave in Arkansas converted to a café, a collection of guns and violins somewhere in Oklahoma, a replica of the Grotto of Lourdes in Louisiana, shabby photographs of the bonanza mining period in the local museum of a Rocky Mountains resort, anything whatsoever -- but it had to be there, in front of us, like a fixed star, although as likely as not Lo would feign gagging as soon as we got to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迫使她承认这一切以后，我总算吓住了洛，不过她尽管态度上有了陡急的变比，智力发生了冲刺性进步，仍然还未达到她的智商所显示的聪敏。但若说我确实建造了分担秘密、分担罪行的背景，另一方面让她保持良好幽默感的成功率很小。在我们长达一年的旅行中，每天清晨，我必须为她设计出一些期望，一些特殊的时间和空间之点让她企盼，让她能存到睡觉的时刻。否则，没有个有形、长远的目的，她生活的框架就会塌陷、崩坍。期望的对象可以是任何东西——弗吉尼亚的灯塔，阿肯色的改成了一家咖啡店的天然洞穴，俄克拉荷马某地的枪支和提琴珍品陈列，路易斯安那仿制的“卢尔德洞室”，落基山某名胜的一个博物馆里收藏的富矿开采时期的照片，不管是什么——只要它们象恒星一样置于我们面前；尽管我们一到那儿，洛很可能就不再装假打浑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By putting the geography of the United States into motion, I did my best for hours on end to give her the impression of "going places," of rolling on to some definite destination, to some unusual delight. I have never seen such smooth amiable roads as those that now radiated before us, across the crazy quilt of forty-eight states. Voraciously we consumed those long highways, in rapt silence we glided over their glossy black dance floors. Not only had Lo no eye for scenery but she furiously resented my calling her attention to this or that enchanting detail of landscape; which I myself learned to discern only after being exposed for quite a time to the delicate beauty ever present in the margin of our undeserving journey. By a paradox of pictorial thought, the average lowland North-American countryside had at first seemed to me something I accepted with a shock of amused recognition because of those painted oilcloths which were imported from America in the old days to be hung above washstands in Central-European nurseries, and which fascinated a drowsy child at bed time with the rustic green views they depicted -- opaque curly trees, a barn, cattle, a brook, the dull white of vague orchards in bloom, and perhaps a stone fence or hills of greenish gouache. But gradually the models of those elementary rusticities became stranger and stranger to the eye, the nearer I came to know them. Beyond the tilled plain, beyond the toy roofs, there would be a slow suffusion of inutile loveliness, a low sun in a platinum haze with a warm, peeled-peach tinge pervading the upper edge of a two-dimensional, dove-gray cloud fusing with the distant amorous mist. There might be a line of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon, and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover, and Claude Lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background. Or again, it might be a stern El Greco horizon, pregnant with inky rain, and a passing glimpse of some mummy-necked farmer, and all around alternating strips of quick-silverish water and harsh green corn, the whole arrangement opening like a fan, somewhere in Kansas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我费尽心力为她讲解美利坚合众国的地形图，目的是给她以“游历各地”、朝既定目的地、朝奇异的快乐行驶的印象。我从来没见过此刻展阔在眼前的这么平滑可爱的公路，横穿四十八州弯弯曲曲的州界。我们贪婪地吞掉条条高速公路，在心荡神驰的静谧中滑过光泽熠熠的黑色跑道。洛不仅无心流连风光，而且还粗暴地怨恨我老让她注意这、注意那迷人景致；我自己也只是由于旅途两边的精致美景一次又一次映入我的眼帘以后才深谙其韵味的。按绘画思想说，北美乡间的宽阔低地乍一出现时，它象是使我想到了某个快活的发现而惊奇不置，那些古时从美洲进口的涂满色彩的油画布就挂在中欧地区托儿所的脸盆架上方，上面画的大绿色块的风竟弄得昏睡沉沉的孩子如痴如醉——不透光的弯扭的树、一座谷仓、一头牛、一条小溪，朦胧的果园开着晦暗的白花，或许还有一堵石垣或绿色树胶水彩画上的山。然而渐渐地，我越熟悉那些田园风光的基本模式，越看它们就越觉陌生。在平原农耕地以及象玩具一样的一排排小屋顶以外，总会缓缓散漫开一副无用的可爱景象，一个低斜的太阳，泛着金白色的光芒，将温暖、象剥了皮的桃肉的颜色撒遍一片二维空间；鸽子灰色的云层上边缘，云和遥远处多情的雾融在一起。或许还有一排高大的树林，在地平线、在苜蓿荒野之上炎热而纯净的正午衬景中形成剪影，克劳德·洛林之云被绘入远处雾迷迷的青空，只有它们堆积的部分在浅灰色晕暗的背景中凸现出来。要不然也可能是伊尔·格列柯凛峻风格的地平线，孕育着黑沉沉的狂风暴雨，一些怀抱农具的农夫一闪即逝，四周是波光鳞鳞的水和涩口的绿玉米，所有这一切都象一把打开的扇子，出现在堪萨斯的某地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At night, tall trucks studded with colored lights, like dreadful giant Christmas trees, loomed in the darkness and thundered by the belated little sedan. And again next day a thinly populated sky, losing its blue to the heat, would melt overhead, and Lo would clamor for a drink, and her cheeks would hollow vigorously over the straw, and the car inside would be a furnace when we got in again, and the road shimmered ahead, with a remote car changing its shape mirage-like in the surface glare, and seeming to hang for a moment, old-fashionedly square and high, in the hot haze. And as we pushed westward, patches of what the garage-man called "sage brush" appeared, and then the mysterious outlines of table-like hills, and then red bluffs ink-blotted with junipers, and then a mountain range, dun grading into blue, and blue into dream, and the desert would meet us with a steady gale, dust, gray thorn bushes, and hideous bits of tissue paper mimicking pale flowers among the prickles of wind-tortured withered stalks all along the highway; in the middle of which there sometimes stood simple cows, immobilized in a position (tail left, white eyelashes right) cutting across all human rules of traffic.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now and then, in the vastness of those plains, huge trees would advance toward us to cluster self-consciously by the roadside and provide a bit of humanitarian shade above a picnic table, with sun flecks, flattened paper cups, samaras and discarded ice-cream sticks littering the brown ground. A great user of roadside facilities, my unfastidious Lo would be charmed by toilet signs -- Guys-Gals, John-Jane, Jack-Jill and even Buck's-Doe's; while lost in an artist's dream, I would stare at the honest brightness of the gasoline paraphernalia against the splendid green of oaks, or at a distant hill scrambling out -- scarred but still untamed -- from the wilderness of agriculture that was trying to swallow it.</div>

<div class="line_en">My lawyer has suggested I give a clear, frank account of the itinerary we followed, and I suppose I have reached here a point where I cannot avoid that chore. Roughly, during that mad year (August 1947 to August 1948), our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in New England, then meandered south, up and down, east and west; dipped deep into ce qu'on appelle Dixieland, avoided Florida because the Farlows were there, veered west, zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts (this is not too clear I am afraid, Clarence, but I did not keep any notes, and have at my disposal only an atrociously crippled tour book in three volumes, almost a symbol of my torn and tattered past, in which to check these recollections); crossed and re-crossed the Rockies, straggled through southern deserts where we wintered; reached the Pacific, turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads; almost reached the Canadian border; and proceeded east, across good lands and bad lands, back to agriculture on a grand scale, avoiding, despite little Lo's strident remonstrations, little Lo's birthplace, in a corn, coal and hog producing area; and finally returned to the fold of the East, petering out in the college town of Beardsley.</div>
