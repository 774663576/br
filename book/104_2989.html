<div class="line_en">I felt proud of myself. I had stolen the honey of a spasm without impairing the morals of a minor. Absolutely no harm done. The conjurer had poured milk, molasses, foaming champagne into a young lady's new white purse; and lo, the purse was intact. Thus had I delicately constructed my ignoble, ardent, sinful dream; and still Lolita was safe -- and I was safe. What I had madly possessed was not she, but my own creation, another, fanciful Lolita -- perhaps, more real than Lolita; overlapping, encasing her; floating between me and her, and having no will, no consciousness -- indeed, no life of her own.</div>

<div class="line_en">The child knew nothing. I had done nothing to her. And nothing prevented me from repeating a performance that affected her as little as if she were a photographic image rippling upon a screen and I a humble hunchback abusing myself in the dark. The afternoon drifted on and on, in ripe silence, and the sappy tall trees seemed to be in the know; and desire, even stronger than before, began to afflict me again. Let her come soon, I prayed, addressing a loan God, and while mamma is in the kitchen, let a repetition of the davenport scene be staged, please, I adore her so horribly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那孩子什么都不知道。我对他什么也不曾做过。同时没有什么阻碍我重演一场对她影响微乎其微的动作，就好象她是银幕上一副动人的影象，而我则是谦卑的驼背人躲在黑暗中手淫。下午不知不觉一点点过去了，在成熟的静谧中，旺盛的大树似乎颇知内情；甚至比先前更强烈的欲望又开始使我痛苦。让她快回来吧，我祈祷外来的上帝，趁妈妈在厨房颓时候，让沙发一幕重演吧，我恳求，我是这般可怕地迷恋她啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had lunch in town -- had not been so hungry for years. The house was still Lo-less when I strolled back. I spent the afternoon musing, scheming, blissfully digesting my experience of the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在城里吃了中午饭——好多年没这么饿过。慢步回去后，房里没有洛。一下午我都在真想、图谋、乐极地咀嚼着我早晨的经历。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No: "horribly" is the wrong word. The elation with which the vision of new delights filled me was not horrible but pathetic. I qualify it as pathetic. Pathetic -- because despite the insatiable fire of my venereal appetite, I intended, with the most fervent force and foresight, to protect the purity of that twelve-year-old child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，“可怕”是不对的词。新的快乐感充溢着我，那种得意扬扬不是可怕而是可怜。我给它定义为可怜。可怜——因为尽管我有贪得无厌、燃烧的情欲，我还是以最坚强的力量将其压抑，力图保护住那个十二岁孩子的纯洁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now see how I was repaid for my pains. No Lolita came home -- she had gone with the Chatfields to a movie. The table was laid with more elegance than usual: candlelight, if you please. In this mawkish aura, Mrs. Haze gently touched the silver on both sides of her plate as if touching piano keys, and smiled down on her empty plate (was on a diet), and said she hoped I liked the salad (recipe lifted from a woman's magazine). She hoped I liked the cold cuts, too. It had been a perfect day. Mrs. Chatfield was a lovely person. Phyllis, her daughter, was going to a summer camp tomorrow. For three weeks. Lolita, it was decided, would go Thursday. Instead of waiting till July, as had been initially planned. And stay there after Phyllis had left. Till school began. A pretty prospect, my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在看看我的痛苦得到的报偿吧。没有洛丽塔回家来——她和查特菲尔德一家去看电影了。桌上比平常布置得更为优雅：点着蜡烛，真是。在这令人伤怀的氛围里，黑兹夫人轻柔地敲敲地盘子两测的银器就象打着琴键，而后又低头朝她的空盘笑笑（正在节食），说她希望我能喜欢那种沙拉（制法是从一本妇女杂志士选的）。她希望我也能喜欢那盘冷拼。那是个完美的日子。查特菲尔德夫人是个可爱的人。菲立斯，她女儿，明天去夏今营。要呆三星期。洛丽塔也已经决定星期四走，不必象先前计划的那样等到七月。菲立斯以后就住在那儿直到开学。一个不错的前景，我的心肝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, how I was taken aback -- for did it not mean I was losing my darling, just when I had secretly made her mine? To explain my grim mood, I had to use the same toothache I had already simulated in the morning. Must have been an enormous molar, with an abscess as big as a maraschino cherry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗅，这消息使我多么惊恐——这难道不意味着我刚刚秘密地将她据为已有，就要失去她吗？为了解释我冷峻的神情，我只得又使用了早晨玩过的牙疼借口。一定是那颗巨大的白齿上长了一块象酒泡的樱桃那么大的溃疡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We have," said Haze, "an excellent dentist. Our neighbor, in fact. Dr. Quilty. Uncle or cousin, I think, of the playwright. Think it will pass? Well, just as you wish. In the fall I shall have him 'brace' her, as my mother used to say. It may curb Lo a little. I am afraid she has been bothering you frightfully all these days. And we are in for a couple of stormy ones before she goes. She has flatly refused to go, and I confess I left her with the Chatfields because I dreaded to face her alone just yet. The movie may mollify her. Phyllis is a very sweet girl, and there is no earthly reason for Lo to dislike her. Really, monsieur, I am very sorry about that tooth of yours. It would be so much more reasonable to let me contact Ivor Quilty first thing tomorrow morning if it still hurts. And, you know, I think a summer camp is so much healthier, and -- well, it is all so much more reasonable as I say than to mope on a suburban lawn and use mamma's lipstick, and pursue shy studious gentlemen, and go into tantrums at the least provocation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们这儿有一位非常出色的牙医，”黑兹说，“其实就是我们的邻居，奎尔蒂。我想就是那位剧作家的叔叔或表哥。觉得能过去？好吧，随你。秋天我就，用我妈妈的话说，让他‘稳住’她，这多少能管束点儿洛。这些日子洛怕是一直搅得你够呛吧。她走之前，我们还得有几天暴风雨的日子。开始她坚决不肯走。电影也许能安慰她。菲立斯是个很甜的女孩儿，洛没有理由不喜欢她。真的，先生，我为您的牙齿感到不安。明天一早如果它还疼，真完全应该让我去请艾弗．奎尔蒂了，这是头等要事。你知道，我觉得夏季宿营是很健康的，而且——当然，我说这完全比呆在草坪上闷闷不乐，用妈妈的口红，追求羞答答的电影男绅士，或者因为一点点事被激怒就大发脾气，总比这些更有意义吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She'd better," said Haze. "And it won't be all play either. The camp is run by Shirley Holmes -- you know, the woman who wrote Campfire Girl. Camp will teach Dolores Haze to grow in many things -- health, knowledge, temper. And particularly in a sense of responsibility toward other people. Shall we take these candles with us and sit for a while on the piazza, or do you want to go to bed and nurse that tooth?"</div>
