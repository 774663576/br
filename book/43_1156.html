<div class="line_en">Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed. The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began to talk of returning early in the new year. Beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll's sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand. Her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms. Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for 'the dear', while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor of this unusually merry Christmas. Laurie was equally impracticable, and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches, if he had had his own way. After many skirmishes and snubbings, the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day. Hannah 'felt in her bones' that it was going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a true prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success. To begin with, Mr. March wrote that he should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's gift, a soft crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie. The Unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近日来天气异常暖和，恰到好处地带来了一个阳光灿烂的圣诞节。罕娜“从骨子里头感觉到”这一天将会是一个不同寻常的大好日子，事实证明她的预言完全正确，因为似乎一切顺利，人人心想事成。首先，马奇先生来信说他很快就要和她们团聚。然后，那天贝思早上觉得特别精神，她穿着妈妈送给她的礼物——一件柔软的深红色美利奴羊毛晨衣——被背到窗前观赏乔和劳里的献礼。两位誓不罢休者大展身手，为了自己的名声，一夜之间像小精灵一样创造了一个妙趣横生的奇观。只见外面花园里耸立着一个庄严高贵的雪人少女，头戴冬青枝花冠，一只手挽一篮水果鲜花，另一只手执一大卷新乐谱，冰冷的肩膀上披一条彩虹般缤纷的阿富汗披围巾，嘴里吐出一首圣诞颂歌，歌词写在一面粉红色的纸幡上：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我又怎能不是呢？”马奇太太看着丈夫写来的信，又看着贝思的笑脸，轻轻抚摸着那枚刚刚由女儿们别在她胸前，用灰色、金色、栗色和深棕色头发做成的胸针，心中充满感激之情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. Half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more, the drop came. Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. He might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, "Here's another Christmas present for the March family."</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to the eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say something and couldn't. Of course there was a general stampede, and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things were done, and no one said a word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话音未落，他便被轻轻推到一边，取而代之的是一个高个子男人，蒙着脸，只露出一双眼睛，靠在另一个高个子男人的手臂上，那男人想说什么却又说不出来。情形当即大乱，大家一时似乎全都失去了理智，她们不发一言，却做出极起离奇古怪的举动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms. Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet. Mr. Brooke kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently explained. And Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in the most touching manner. Mrs. March was the first to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, "Hush! Remember Beth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母女四人一拥而上，动情地把马奇先生紧紧围抱起来，乔几乎晕倒，不得不在瓷器间里接受劳里的救治，大失淑女风度；布鲁克先生亲吻梅格，那是纯属误会，他后来结结巴巴地解释；而艾美，这位高贵小姐，被凳子绊了一跤，也不爬起来，而是就势抱着她父亲的双脚动情大哭。马奇太太第一个恢服了常态，举起手来示意：“嘘！别忘了贝思！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was too late. The study door flew open, the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father's arms.

<div class="line_cn" title="但已经太迟了；书房门猛然打开，穿着红色晨衣的小人儿跨出门槛——欢乐给软弱无力的四肢注入了力量——贝思直扑进父亲的怀中。此后发生了什么已无关重要。洋溢心头的幸福之情已冲走了昨天的痛苦，此时此刻，大家心中只有一片甜蜜，一片温馨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March began to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired. Then the two invalids were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家笑过后，马奇太太开始向布鲁克先生道谢，感谢他精心照顾自己的丈夫，布鲁克先生突然想起马奇先生需要休息，赶快拽起劳里仓促撤离。众人命两位病人休息，两人不敢违命，便一同坐在一张大椅子上谈个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how, when the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man. Why Mr. March paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine. Also why Mrs. March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he wouldn't like to have something to eat. Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, "I hate estimable young men with brown eyes!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马奇先生诉说了自己是如何想让她们惊喜一番，医生是如何让他趁天气暖和出院，布鲁克这年轻人又是如何热心，如何正直有涵养等等。说到这里马奇先生顿一顿，扫了一眼正在捅炉火的梅格，扬起双眉望望妻子，似乎在询问什么，起中深意何在，请读者们自己想象；马奇太太也轻轻点点头，然后颇为突然地问他是否要吃点什么。乔明白这个眼色的意思，便板着面孔去拿牛肉汁和酒，一面把门呼的一声带上，咕咕哝哝地自语道：“我憎恨棕色眼睛有涵养的年轻人！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时发生一了一件虽不浪漫但却令人捧腹的事情，把大家重新带回到现实生活之中。大家发现罕娜站在门后，捧着肥硕的火鸡抽抽噎噎：原来她从厨房冲出来时忘了把火鸡放下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day. The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned, and decorated. So was the plum pudding, which melted in one's mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot. Everything turned out well, which was a mercy, Hannah said, "For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that it's a merrycle I didn't roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin' of it in a cloth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天的圣诞晚餐是有史以来最为丰盛的一次。罕娜端上的火鸡又肥又大，里头塞满了填料，烤得赤里透红，而且点缀得十分好看；葡萄干布丁也同样令人垂涎欲滴，放进口里就溶化了；还有令人胃口大开的果子冻，把艾美喜得就像落到了蜜罐里的苍蝇，吃得痛快淋漓。一切都尽如人意，这真是上天可怜，罕娜说：“因为我当时心里头别提有多慌张，太太，我没有错把布丁烤熟，把菩提子干塞到火鸡里头，把火鸡包在布里煮，已经是一个奇迹了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr. Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement. Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. They drank healths, told stories, sang songs, 'reminisced', as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. A sleigh ride had been planned, but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the happy family sat together round the fire.</div>

And taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm. "I remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. It was very pretty then, but to me it is much prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read a little history. A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and I'm sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches. Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments. I'm proud to shake this good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be asked to give it away."</div>

<div class="line_en">"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the 'son Jo' whom I left a year ago," said Mr. March. "I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do. Her face is rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is lower. She doesn't bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me. I rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful, tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied. I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“虽然披着一头卷曲的短发，我看到的已经不是一年前我离开时的‘乔小子’了，“马奇先生说，”我看到的是一位衣领别得笔挺、靴带系得利索、谈吐斯文，既不吹口哨、也不像以前一样随便躺在地毯上的年轻女士。由于照顾病人，忧虑劳碌，她这会儿面容瘦削苍白，但我喜欢看这张脸，因为它变得更温柔可爱了。她说话的声音也更轻柔了；她不再蹦跳，而是款款而行，并像慈母一样照顾一个小人儿，令我十分快慰。我很怀念我的野姑娘，但如果她变成一个坚强、能帮助人、心地善良的女子，我也该心满意足了。我不知道我们的小黑羊是否因剪了毛而变得严肃庄重，但我知道华盛顿的东西再多再漂亮，也没有一样值得我用好女儿寄来的二十五元钱购买。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite, with an unusually mild expression in her face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise, feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到父亲的夸奖，乔明亮的双眼有点模糊了，瘦削的面孔在炉火映照下升起了两朵红晕，她觉得这话并不是很过分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他沉默了一会，然后低头望着坐在他脚边垫脚凳上的艾美，吻吻她亮丽的头发，说——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在轮到贝思。”艾美一心想轮到自己，但准备等下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used to be," began their father cheerfully. But recollecting how nearly he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek against his own, "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so, please God."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对于她我不敢多说，担心说多了会把她吓走，虽说她现在没有以前那么害羞了，”父亲笑嘻嘻地说。但想到自己差一点就要失去这个女儿，他把她紧紧抱住，和她脸贴着脸，动情地说：“你平安在我身边，我的贝思，我要你一生平安，上帝保佑你！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and has waited on every one with patience and good humor. I also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures. I am glad of this, for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我注意到艾美吃饭时也吃鸡脚了，整个下午都替妈妈打杂，今天晚上又让位给梅格坐，耐心而愉快地帮大家的忙。我还注意到她不再动辄愁眉苦脸，不再照镜子，也不提她戴着一个漂亮戒指；由此我得出一个结论，她已经学会了多想别人，少想自己，并决心像塑造自己的小泥塑人物一样认真塑造自己的性格。我对此感到很高兴，我为女儿拥有艺术才华而感到十分骄傲，但我更为女儿拥有为别人、为自己美化生活的才华而感到无比自豪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I read in Pilgrim's Progress today how, after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey's end," answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the instrument, "It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place. I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard. I made the music for Father, because he likes the verses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今天我读《天路历程》，读到‘基督教徒’和‘希望’如何排除万难来到一片长年开满百合花的怡人的草地上，在那儿愉快地歇息，如我们现在一样，然后继续向他们的目的地进发，”贝思答道，一面从父亲的臂膀中溜脱出来，慢慢走到钢琴前，又说，”唱歌时间到了，我想做回自己的旧角儿。我来试着唱唱朝圣者们听到的那首牧羊童子唱的歌儿。因为父亲喜欢这首歌的歌词，我特地为他作了曲。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again, sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a singularly fitting song for her.</div>
