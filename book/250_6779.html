<div class="line_en">Next morning a score of us went with Hillyer, out of friendship, and helped him bury his late relative, the unlamented Buckner, and I acted as first assistant pall-bearer, Hillyer acting as chief. Just as we had finished our labors a ragged and melancholy stranger, carrying an old hand-bag, limped by with his head down, and I caught the scent I had chased around the globe! It was the odor of Paradise to my perishing hope!</div>

<div class="line_en">A glance at his wild eyes showed us that he was insane. That was my work, mother! The tidings of your death can some day repeat the misery I felt in that moment, but nothing else can ever do it. The boys lifted him up, and gathered about him, and were full of pity of him, and said the gentlest and touchingest things to him, and said cheer up and don't be troubled, he was among friends now, and they would take care of him, and protect him, and hang any man that laid a hand on him. They are just like so many mothers, the rough mining-camp boys are, when you wake up the south side of their hearts; yes, and just like so many reckless and unreasoning children when you wake up the opposite side of that muscle.

<div class="line_en">James Walker drew a deep sigh; evidently a sigh of relief; and said nothing; but his eyes lost something of their wildness, his countenance cleared visibly, and its drawn look relaxed a little. We all went to our cabin, and the boys cooked him the best dinner the camp could furnish the materials for, and while they were about it Hillyer and I outfitted him from hat to shoe-leather with new clothes of ours, and made a comely and presentable old gentleman of him. Old is the right word, and a pity, too: old by the droop of him, and the frost upon his hair, and the marks which sorrow and distress have left upon his face; though he is only in his prime in the matter of years. While he ate, we smoked and chatted; and when he was finishing he found his voice at last, and of his own accord broke out with his personal history. I cannot furnish his exact words, but I will come as near it as I can.</div>

All of a sudden I got a notice to leave, or I would be exposed for a horrible crime committed long before; years and years before; in the East.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当初发生的事情是这样的：我住在丹佛，我在那儿已经有好多年了；有时候我能记得到底有多少年，有时候又记不清楚——不过这无关紧要。突然，我收到了一纸驱逐令，假如我不走，就揭露我牵涉一桩可怕的罪案，那件案子是很久——不知有多少年——前在东部发生的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew about that crime, but I was not the criminal; it was a cousin of mine of the same name. What should I better do? My head was all disordered by fear, and I didn't know. I was allowed very little time; only one day, I think it was. I would be ruined if I was published, and the people would lynch me, and not believe what I said. It is always the way with lynchings: when they find out it is a mistake they are sorry, but it is too late,; the same as it was with Mr. Holmes, you see. So I said I would sell out and get money to live on, and run away until it blew over and I could come back with my proofs. Then I escaped in the night and went a long way off in the mountains somewhere, and lived disguised and had a false name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道这桩罪行，可我自己并不是罪人；那是我的一个同名同姓的堂兄干的。我该怎么办才好呢？我惶惶不可终日，手足无措。给我限定的时间很少——我记得只有一天。如果我被曝了光，那就全毁了，大家会对我动私刑，我说什么都不会有人听。私刑从来都是如此：事后就算发觉是冤案，后悔也无济于事了——就和福尔摩斯先生的遭遇一样。所以我决意卖掉产业，换成维持生计的现款逃走。直到水落石出、能证明我清白的时候，我再回来。于是，我当天夜里逃离了丹佛，远走高飞，改头换面，用了一个假名字在山里隐居。">查看中文翻译</div>

It got to be worse and worse; more spirits and more voices. They were about me all the time; at first only in the night, then in the day too.

From habit he had written his real name on a tavern register, but had scratched it out and written "Dagget Barclay" in the place of it.

Some brutal roughs from Dalys gorge had Holmes in their grip, and he was the calmest man there; a contemptuous smile played about his lips, and if any fear of death was in his British heart, his iron personality was master of it and no sign of it was allowed to appear.</div>

The man struck another, stooped, and again the flame rose; this time it took hold and began to spread; here and there men turned away their faces.

<div class="line_en">"You're a nice lot; now ain't you? Just about eligible to travel with this bilk here; Shadbelly Higgins; this loud-mouthed sneak that shoots people in the back and calls himself a desperado. If there's anything I do particularly despise, it's a lynching mob; I've never seen one that had a man in it. It has to tally up a hundred against one before it can pump up pluck enough to tackle a sick tailor. It's made up of cowards, and so is the community that breeds it; and ninety-nine times out of a hundred the sheriffs another one." He paused; apparently to turn that last idea over in his mind and taste the juice of it; then he went on: "The sheriff that lets a mob take a prisoner away from him is the lowest-down coward there is. By the statistics there was a hundred and eighty-two of them drawing sneak pay in America last year. By the way it's going, pretty soon there'll be a new disease in the doctor books; sheriff complaint." That idea pleased him; any one could see it. "People will say, 'Sheriff sick again?' 'Yes; got the same old thing.' And next there'll be a new title. People won't say, 'Hes running for sheriff of Rapaho County, for instance;' they'll say, 'Hes running for Coward of Rapaho.' Lord, the idea of a grown-up person being afraid of a lynch mob!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们都是好人——是不是呀？好得跟这个骗子——沙德贝里·希金斯搞到一起去了。这个唱高调的混账东西专会背后捅刀子，是一个十足的混混。要说有什么东西我最看不起，那就是动私刑的了。我从来没见过动私刑的当中有一个真正的男人。动私刑是以多欺少，鼓动一百个刽子手去处置一个病裁缝。只有胆小鬼才动私刑，大家起哄，才成全了这些胆小鬼；不过，一百个县警官可有九十九个不是胆小鬼。”他停了停，显然是把最后一句话再琢磨一遍，回味一下——他接著说：“如果县警官让暴民从他手里夺走了一个囚犯，他就是一个最不称职的胆小鬼。据统计，去年全美国一共有一百八十二个县警官因为人家动私刑背了黑锅。照这样下去，用不了多久，医书里就得添一种新病——‘埋怨警官病’”。在场的人都看得出来，警官为想出这个新词得意洋洋。“大家会说：‘县警官又病啦？’‘是啊，又犯了老毛病啦。’紧接著，就要发明一个新官衔了。那时候，人家不说：‘他正竞选拉巴霍县警官呢，’人家说：‘他正竞选拉巴霍县胆小鬼呢。’上帝，想想，一个大男人怕一帮动私刑的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was wonderful, the impression which the sound of that name made on the sheriff, notwithstanding he must have come posted. He spoke up with feeling, and said it was a blot on the country that a man whose marvelous exploits had filled the world with their fame and their ingenuity, and whose histories of them had won every readers heart by the brilliancy and charm of their literary setting, should be visited under the Stars and Stripes by an outrage like this. He apologized in the name of the whole nation, and made Holmes a most handsome bow, and told Constable Harris to see him to his quarters, and hold himself personally responsible if he was molested again. The he turned to the mob and said:</div>
