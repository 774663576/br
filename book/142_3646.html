<div class="line_en">When Michael Corleone arrived at his father's house in Long Beach he found the narrow entrance mouth of the mall blocked off with a link chain. The mall itself was bright with the floodlights of all eight houses, outlining at least ten cars parked along the curving cement walk.</div>

<div class="line_en">He told them. Another man came out of the nearest house and peered at his face. "That's the Don's kid," he said. "I'll bring him inside." Mike followed this man to his father's house, where two men at the door let him and his escort pass inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">The house seemed to be full of men he didn't know, until he went into the living room. There Michael saw Tom Hagen's wife, Theresa, sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette. On the coffee table in front of her was a glass of whiskey. On the other side of the sofa sat the bulky Clemenza. The caporegime's face was impassive, but he was sweating and the cigar in his hand glistened slickly black with his saliva.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子里挤满了他不认识的人。他走进起居室才见到一个熟人。迈克尔看到汤姆·黑根的老婆姿瑞莎呆呆地坐在长沙发上抽着香烟，在她面前的咖啡桌上摆着一杯威士忌。长沙发的另一端坐着大胖子克莱门扎。这位兵团司令的脸上没有表情，只是一个劲儿地冒汗，他手上拿着的雪茄烟给口水浸湿了，显得黑光黑光的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael went to Hagen's wife and bent down to kiss her cheek. They had always liked each other. He whispered, "Don't worry, Tom will be OK. Have you talked to Sonny yet?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔走到黑根的老婆这边来，弯下腰在她的脸上吻了一下。他们的关系一直很亲密。他小声说：“别担心，汤姆始终不会出问题。你同桑儿谈过了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza came to wring his hand in a consoling way, muttering, "Your mother is at the hospital with your father, he's going to be all right." Paulie Gatto stood up to shake hands. Michael looked at him curiously. He knew Paulie was his father's bodyguard but did not know that Paulie had stayed home sick that day. But he sensed tension in the thin dark face. He knew Gatto's reputation as an up-and-coming man, a very quick man who knew how to get delicate jobs done without complications, and today he had failed in his duty. He noticed several other men in the corners of the room but he did not recognize them. They were not of Clemenza's people. Michael put these facts together and understood. Clemenza and Gatto were suspect. Thinking that Paulie had been at the scene, he asked the ferret-faced young man, "How is Freddie? He OK?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎走过来，一面以表示安慰的神态同他握手，一面说：“你妈妈到医院去陪你爸爸去了。他现在快要醒过来了。”鲍里·嘎吐站起来也想握手。迈克尔好奇地端详着他。他知道鲍里是他父亲的保膘，但却不知道他今天生病在家。但是鲍里脸上的紧张神色，他是觉察出来了。他知道嘎吐一向是以“招之即来、来之能战”的干将闻名的。他办事果断、迅速，遇到复杂而微妙的任务，知道如何用快刀斩乱麻的办法去解决，而今天他却失职了。迈克尔也注意到屋角还有几个人，但他不认识他们。他们不是克莱门扎手下的人。迈克尔把这些现象综合起来分析了一下，心中就明白了。克莱门扎和嘎吐都是嫌疑犯。他以为鲍里当时是在场的，他就问这个油头滑脑的年轻人：“弗烈特怎么样？他不要紧吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa clung to him for a moment and shook her head. She was a delicate, very pretty woman, more American than Italian, and very scared. He took her hand and lifted her off the sofa. Then he led her into his father's corner room office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姿瑞莎紧紧地偎在他身上。过了一会，她摇摇头。她是个身体纤弱，非常美丽的女人。她更像美国女人而不大像意大利女人，很容易受惊。他牵着她的手，从沙发上把她拉起来。然后，他领她到他父亲的楼角大房间办公室去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He released Theresa and then to Michael's surprise he too, got a hug and a kiss on the cheek. He pushed Sonny away and said grinning, "After I get used to you beating me up I gotta put up with this?" They had often fought when they were younger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把姿瑞莎放开了。然后，令迈克尔感到惊奇的是桑儿把他也拥抱了一下，并在脸上吻了一下。迈克尔把桑儿推开，龇牙咧嘴地说：“我平时被你打惯了，现在怎么能吃你这一套？”他们兄弟俩小时候打架是家常便饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny was sprawled out in his chair behind the desk holding a yellow pad in one hand and a pencil in the other.

<div class="line_en">Sonny shrugged. "Listen, kid, I was worried when I couldn't get ahold of you in that hick town. Not that I gave a crap if they knocked you off, but I didn't like the idea of bringing the news to the old lady. I had to tell her about Pop."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿耸耸肩。“你听着，小鬼，当我派的人到你那个乡下小镇去找不到你的时候，我还很担心哪。不是怕人家把你干掉我会很伤心，而是不忍心让老太太听到这样的消息。爸爸的事，我不得不给她讲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How'd she take it?" Michael asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她听到了之后怎么样？”迈克尔问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good," Sonny said. "She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it and then things got pretty smith while you were growing up." He paused and then said, "She's down at the hospital with the old man. He's gonna pull through."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还好，”桑儿说，“她以前也经受过这类事。我也经受过。你那时还小，不懂事；当你大了之后，情况就好转了。”他停了一会，然后又说，“她到医院陪咱老子去了。他已脱离危险。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny shook his head and said dryly, "I can't leave this house until it's all over." The phone rang. Sonny picked it up and listened intently. While he was listening Michael sauntered over to the desk and glanced down at the yellow pad Sonny had been writing on. There was a list of seven names. The first three were Sollozzo, Phillip Tattaglia, and John Tattaglia. It struck Michael with full force that he had interrupted Sonny and Tessio as they were making up a list of men to be killed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿摇摇头，然后干巴巴地说：“事情没有结束，我是不能离开这栋房子的。”电话铃响了。桑儿抓起话筒，全神贯注地听着。迈克尔游游荡荡地走到办公桌这边，瞅了瞅桑儿刚才还在上面写写画画的便笺簿，上面有六七个人的名字。前面三个是：索洛佐、斐力普塔塔格里亚、约翰·塔塔格里亚。迈克尔感到桑儿同忒希奥正在拟定暗杀名单，他的到来干扰了他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagen's wife said, "Was that call about Tom?" She said it almost truculently but she was weeping with fright. Sonny put his arm around her and led her to the door. "I swear he's going to be OK," he said. "Wait in the living room. I'll come out as soon as I hear something." He shut the door behind her. Michael had sat down in one of the big leather armchairs. Sonny gave him a quick sharp look and then went to sit down behind the desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑根的老婆说：“刚才那个电话讲的是汤姆的事吗？”她的语气简直有点粗暴，不过她却因为恐惧而哭哭啼啼。桑儿用一只胳膊搂着她的腰，领她向门口走去。“我发誓，他很快就会回来，”他说。“在起居室等一等吧。我一听到什么就出来告诉你。”她一出去，桑儿随手把门关上。迈克尔坐在一个很大的皮扶手椅上。桑儿向他严厉地扫视了一下，然后又回到办公桌后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael sat down again and relaxed back into the leather armchair. He thought everything over very carefully. Clemenza was a caporegime in the Corleone Family structure. Don Corleone had made him a millionaire and they had been intimate friends for over twenty years. He held one of the most powerful posts in the organization. What could Clemenza gain for betraying his Don? More money? He was rich enough but then men are always greedy. More power? Revenge for some fancied insult or slight? That Hagen had been made the Consigliere? Or perhaps a businessman's conviction that Sollozzo would win out? No, it was impossible for Clemenza to be a traitor, and then Michael thought sadly it was only impossible because he didn't want Clemenza to die. The fat man had always brought him gifts when he was growing up, had sometimes taken him on outings when the Don had been too busy. He could not believe that Clemenza was guilty of treachery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔又坐下来，懒洋洋地朝后靠在皮扶手椅上，把一桩桩一件件的事都非常认真地考虑了一番：克莱门扎是考利昂家族组织内部的兵团司令，考利昂老头子一手把他扶植成了百万富翁，而且二十多年来他们一直是亲密朋友。他在组织内部居于最有实力的职位，出卖老头子能捞到什么油水？为了多拿些钱？他的钱是够多的了。但也很难说，人总是贪得无厌的。为了享有更大的权力？莫非因为幻想自己受辱或受轻视而采取这种报复行为？莫非他对黑根被提拔为参谋而产生了反感？或者，按商人的信念认定索洛佐会青云直上？不会，要克莱门扎当叛徒是不可能的。这个大胖子在迈克尔成长过程中经常给他送这送那，在老头子太忙的时候就领他出去玩。迈克尔绝不相信克莱门扎犯了背叛罪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny grinned at him. "Pretty soon you'll want me to put up my dukes. OK, stick around, you can handle the phone." He turned to Tessio. "That call I just got gave me dope we needed." Hd turned to Michael. "Somebody had to finger the old man. It could have been Clemenza, it could have been Paulie Gatto, who was very conveniently sick today. I know the answer now, let's see how smart you are, Mike, you're the college boy. Who sold out to Sollozzo?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿笑了。“你马上就会尝尝我的拳头的滋味。好吧，别走，就呆在这儿，你可以守守电话。”说罢，他就回头同忒希奥商量正事去了。“刚才接到的那个电话给我提供了咱们所需要的内部情报，”他口头对迈克尔说，“一定有内线在暗中把老头子指给刺客。这内线可能是克莱门扎，也可能是鲍里·嘎吐。鲍里他今天偏偏病了。装病非常方便。我现在已经知道了答案。咱是想考考你，看你有多么精明。迈克，你是大学生了。你看是谁投靠了索洛佐？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael thought about Paulie Gatto. Paulie as yet had not become rich. He was well thought of, his rise in the organization was certain but he would have to put in his time like everybody else. Also he would have wilder dreams of power, as the young always do. It had to be Paulie. And then Michael remembered that in the sixth grade he and Paulie had been in the same class in school and he didn't want it to be Paulie either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔又把念头转到了鲍里·嘎吐身上。鲍里到现在还没有发财。他是受器重的，在考利昂家族中会步步高升，这也是确定无疑的。不过同大家一样，他也得磨一段时间才行。还有，就像今天的年轻人一样，他在权力方面会更加想入非非。内好必定是鲍里。迈克尔又想到，在中学六年级时，他同鲍里是同班，因而他也不愿意相信内好就是鲍里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, on the other hand, Sollozzo would want Clemenza in his pocket more than any other man in the Corleone Family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，从另一方面讲，索洛佐在考利昂家族成员中需要把克莱门扎捏在手中比需要把别的任何人捏在手中都要来得更加迫切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shook his head. "Neither one of them," he said. But he said it only because Sonny had said he had the answer. If it had been a vote, he would have voted Paulie guilty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他摇摇头。“两个都不是，”他说。但是，他之所以这样说，就是因为桑儿说过他已经心中有数了。如果要投票表决的话，他本来会赞成鲍里是有罪的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael could see that Tessio was relieved. As a fellow caporegime his sympathy would be with Clemenza. Also the present situation was not so serious if treachery did not reach so high. Tessio said cautiously, "Then I can send my people home tomorrow?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔看得出，经桑儿那样一说，忒希奥如释重负。同是兵团司令，他的同情心当然会在克莱门扎一边。还有一层原因：如果不是地位那么高的人背叛，局势也不会太严重。忒希奥小心翼翼地“那明天我就可以打发我的人回家了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Again Sonny's voice was patient. "They snatched Tom because they figured the old man was finished and they could make a deal with me and Tom would be the sit-down guy in the preliminary stages, carry the proposition. Now with the old man alive they know I can't make a deal so Tom's no good to them. They can turn him loose or dump him, depending how Sollozzo feels. If they dump him, it would be just to show us they really mean business, trying to bulldoze us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿的语气还是显得很有耐心。“他们之所以抓汤姆，是因为他们认为把咱老头子干掉后，就可以直接同我做交易，而汤姆就是谈判的牵线人，可以把他们的方案带回来。而现在老头子还活着。他们明白我不能自作主张做交易，因此汤姆对他们也就没有用处了。他们可能释放他，也可能把他干掉，这就要看索洛佐怎样认识问题了。要是他们把他干掉，那就等于向我们表明，人家是认真的，拼命想胁迫我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was surprised at this. "Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿说的最后那句活，迈克尔有点迷惑不解。“凭什么不？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonny flushed and he didn't answer for a moment. Then he said, "We had a meeting a few months ago, Sollozzo came to us with a proposition on drugs. The old man turned him down. But during the meeting I shot off my mouth a little, I showed I wanted the deal. Which is absolutely the wrong thing to do; if there's one thing the old man hammered into me it's never, to do a thing like that, to let other people know there's a split of opinion in the Family. So Sollozzo figures he gets rid of the old man, I have to go in with him on the drugs. With the old man gone, the Family power is cut at least in half. I would be fighting for my life anyway to keep all the businesses the old man got together. Drugs are the coming thing, we should get into it. And his knocking off the old man is purely business, nothing personal. As a matter of business I would go in with him. Of course he would never let me get too close, he'd make sure I'd never get a clean shot at him, just in case. But he also knows that once I accepted the deal the other Families would never let me start a war a couple of years later just for revenge. Also, the Tattaglia Family is behind him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿脸红了，一时答不上话来。过了一会，他说：“几个月之前，我们举行一次会谈，索洛佐提出一个合伙做生意的方案。咱老头子拒绝了。但是在会谈过程中，我说话走了火，流露出我想要做那笔交易。我是绝对错误的。如果说老头子对我有什么教导，使我永远不忘的话，那就是千万不可做那样的蠢事，也就是说千万不可让外人知道我们家庭内部有意见分歧。所以索洛佐就打了如意算盘：他把老头子敲掉，我必定会同他搭伙搞毒品买卖。老头子一死，咱家族的实力就等于砍掉了一半。要守住老头子创下的家业，我无论如何也得苦斗一辈子。毒品是将来大有搞头的买卖，咱们倒也应该加入。他敲掉老头子，纯粹是出于生意的考虑，而不是个人恩怨。论做生意，我倒愿意跟他合伙。当然罗，他绝对不会让我掌握过多的内情。但是他也明白，我一旦同意合伙，别的家族也绝不会容许我在一两年之后单纯为了报仇而发动战争。再说，塔塔格里亚家族就是他的后盾。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny said very simply, "Sollozzo is dead meat. I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia Family is going to be wiped out. I don't care if we all go down together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿说的非常简单，“那，索洛佐就是一堆死肉。那我就豁出去了，即使咱们迫不得已而要同纽约的五大家族打仗，我也在所不惜。塔塔格里亚家族，迟早得一锅端。即使大家都同归于尽，我也在所不辞。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonny made a violent gesture. "I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action I can operate as good as anybody, short-range. Sollozzo knows that and so do Clemenza and Tessio, I 'made my bones' when I was nineteen, the last time the Family had a war, and I was a big help to the old man. So I'm not worried now. And our Family has all the horses in a deal like this. I just wish we could get contact with Luca."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑儿猛地把手一甩。“我没有他那种为人的素质。但是，我现在对你说的话，也可能就是他要对你说的话。到了真刀真枪大干的关键时刻，我不会比任何人逊色，短兵相接我也不怕。这一点索洛佐明白，克莱门扎和忒希奥也明白。我十九岁时就经过“过硬的考验”——那次咱家族同别的家族打仗——我就是咱老头子的得力助手。因此，我现在并不心虚。在这样的斗争中，咱们家族是定操左券的。我目前只是希望尽快地同路加联系上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment they heard a woman scream in the living room. Oh, Christ, Michael thought, it sounded like Tom's wife. He rushed to the door and opened it. Everybody in the living room was standing. And by the sofa Tom Hagen was holding Theresa close to him, his face embarrassed. Theresa was weeping and sobbing, and Michael realized that the scream he had heard had been her calling out her husband's name with joy. As he watched, Tom Hagen disentangled himself from his wife's arms and lowered her back onto the sofa. He smiled at Michael grimly. "Glad to see you, Mike, really glad." He strode into the office without another look at his still-sobbing wife. He hadn't lived with the Corleone Family ten years for nothing, Michael thought with a queer flush of pride. Some of the old man had rubbed off on him, as it had on Sonny, and he thought, with surprise, even on himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恰在此刻，他们听到一个女人在起居室里突然尖叫起来。哦，上帝耶稣啊，迈克尔想，这听上去有点像汤姆的老婆的声音。他冲过去，打开门一看，起居室里的每个人都站起来了。汤姆·黑根紧紧地拥抱着姿瑞莎，脸上有点难为情的样子；姿瑞莎激动得抽抽噎噎，眼泪汪汪。迈克尔一看到这种情景就明白，刚才是她狂喜地呼喊自己的丈夫。这时候，汤姆·黑根正从老婆的怀抱里挣脱出来，并把她放到沙发上让她坐下。他对迈克尔冷冰冰地笑了一下，说：“看到你，我很高兴，迈克，真的很高兴。”随后，他大踏步地径直向办公室走去。他同考利昂家族一起生活的十年不是白白度过了，迈克尔这样想。他由于一种莫名其妙的骄傲而脸发红了。老子的某些素质，通过耳濡目染，也转移到黑根身上了，就像转移到桑儿身上一样。同时他惊奇地发现，甚至也转移到他本人的身上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael shifted uneasily in his chair. He looked at his older brother. He remembered Sonny as being sometimes casually brutal but essentially warmhearted. A nice guy. It seemed unnatural to hear him talking this way, it was chilling to see the list of names he had scribbled down, men to be executed, as if he were some newly crowned Roman Emperor. He was glad that he was not truly part of all this, that now his father lived he did not have to involve himself in vengeance. He'd help out, answering the phone, running errands and messages. Sonny and the old man could take care of themselves, especially with Luca behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔在椅子里不安地移动了几下，打量着自己的哥哥。他想到桑儿性情暴躁，但本质上仍不失为一个好人。从他口里说出这样的话，听起来似乎有点反常；看到他列出的被处决者的名单，实在令人不寒而栗，桑儿简直就像新加冕的罗马大皇帝。使他感到快慰的是，这一切他都没有参与。现在他父亲还活着，他也没有必要卷入复仇活动。他可以从一旁帮帮忙，跑跑腿，送送信。桑儿和老子各人能料理自己分内的事情，尤其是他们还有路加这个后盾。">查看中文翻译</div>
