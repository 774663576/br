<div class="line_en">This was Wu Yue's first thought as he faced Tang, the massive ship under construction in front of him, bathed in the flickering of electric arcs. Of course, this impression was simply the result of countless inconsequential smudges on the manganese steel plates of the ship's nearly completed body, left behind by the advanced gas-shield welding used on the hull. He tried unsuccessfully to imagine how sturdy and new Tang would look with a fresh coat of gray paint.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tang's fourth offshore fleet training session had just concluded. During that two-month session, Tang's commanders, Wu Yue and Zhang Beihai, who was standing just beside Wu Yue, had occupied an uncomfortable role. Formations of destroyers, submarines, and supply ships were directed by battle group commanders, but Tang was still under construction in the dock, so the carrier's position was either occupied by the training ship Zheng He or simply left empty. During the sessions, Wu Yue often stared vacantly at an empty patch of sea where the surface of the water, disturbed by crisscrossing trails left by passing ships, undulated uneasily, much like his mood. Would the empty spot ever be filled? he asked himself more than once.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wu Yue adhered to one article of faith: Command of a warship was a dangerous position, so the two commanders must understand each other's minds. This presented Wu Yue with a knotty problem. At first, he thought that Zhang Beihai was somehow on guard, which offended Wu. In the tough post of captain of a destroyer, was anyone more forthright and guileless than he was? What do I have worth guarding against?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吴岳一直坚持这样一个信条：在战舰指挥这个艰险的岗位上，两个指挥员必须很好地了解对方的思维方式，所以这一点一直是吴岳心中的一个疙瘩。开始，他以为这是章北海对自己的某种防范，感到很委屈：在驱逐舰长这个不上不下的艰难岗位上，还有谁比自己更坦诚更没心计吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zhang Beihai laughed as he said this, but it was the sort of laugh that Wu Yue couldn't read. Zhang Beihai's eyes could easily read deep into the heart of everyone aboard the ship, be they captain or sailor. Wu Yue was entirely transparent to him. But Wu Yue could not read what was inside Zhang. He was certain that the man's smile came from within him, but had no hope of understanding him. Successful cooperation does not equate to successful understanding. There was no question that Zhang Beihai was the most capable political commissar on the ship, and he was forthright in his work, exploring every last issue with complete precision. But his internal world was a bottomless gray to Wu Yue, who always felt like Zhang Beihai was saying: Just do it this way. This way's best, or most correct. But it's not what I really want. It began as an indistinct feeling that grew increasingly obvious. Of course, whatever Zhang Beihai did was always the best or most correct, but Wu Yue had no idea what he actually wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="章北海笑笑说，仍然是那种让吴岳看不懂的笑，但他可以肯定这微笑是发自内心的，既然发自内心的东西都看不懂，那就根本没希望懂得他这个人了。成功的合作不等于成功的了解。当然，吴岳自己在章北海的眼中肯定是全透明的，从舰上的水兵到他这个舰长，章北海总是能轻易地看到他们内心深处，他肯定是最称职的政委。章北海在工作上也是很坦诚的，对于舰长，每件事前前后后都有很详细的交底。但他的内心世界对吴岳一直是一片深不见底的灰色，他总给吴岳这样的感觉：就这样傲吧。这样做最好或最正确，但这不是我所想的。这种感觉开始只是隐隐约约，后来越来越明显。当然，章北海做的往往是最好或最正确的，但他是怎么想的，吴岳就不知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The surrounding snowdrifts were thrown by the fire into the air, where they fell again as rain. When the cylinder gained enough height, the explosions that had terrified the deer were again replaced by peace.

<div class="line_en">"Then what's the system attacking?" asked General Fitzroy. Nuclear Missile Defense was just one of the duties of his new position, and he wasn't entirely familiar with it yet. Looking at the monitor-covered wall, the general attempted to locate the intuitive graphical displays they'd had at the NASA control center: a red line snaking across the world map, forming a sine wave atop the map's planar transformation. Novices found this inexplicable, but at least it let you know that something was shooting into space. But there was nothing so simple here. The lines on the screens were a complicated abstract jumble that was meaningless to him. Not to mention all the screens with swiftly scrolling numbers that had meaning only to the NMD duty officers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那系统攻击的是什么？”斐兹罗将军问，NMD只是他新的职责所涉及的一部分，他并不熟悉，看着那布满一面墙壁的显示屏，将军力图找出在NASA的控制中心能看到的那种直观画面：一条红线像懒洋洋的蛇一般在世界地图上移动，虽然由于地图的平面转换，那条线最终会形成一条令外行费解的正弦波，但至少可以让人感觉到有东西在射向太空。可是这里没有这种直观图像，每块显示屏上的曲线都是抽象而杂乱的一团，在他看来毫无意义，更不要提那些飞快滚动的数字屏幕了。这些东西只有这几个对他似乎缺少足够尊敬的NMD值勤军官才能看懂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day before, Zhang Yuanchao filed his retirement papers and left the chemical plant where he had worked for more than four decades. In the words of his neighbor Lao Yang, today was the start of his second childhood. Lao Yang told him that sixty, like sixteen, was the best time in life, an age where the burdens of one's forties and fifties had been laid down, but the slowdown and illness of the seventies and eighties had not yet arrived. An age to enjoy life. Zhang Yuanchao's son and daughter-in-law had steady jobs, and although his son had married late, he would be holding a grandson before long.

<div class="line_en">When Zhang Yuanchao thought about it, everything was completely satisfactory. He had to admit that as far as affairs of state were concerned, Lao Yang was right. Still, as he looked out from his eighth-story window at the clear sky over the city, he felt like there was no sunlight in his heart, much less a second childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想想真的一切都很满足了。但现在，张援朝从他八层楼的窗子望着外面晴朗天空下的城市，心里却没有一点阳光，更别提第二童年的感觉了。现在他不得不承认。关于国家大事的说法，老扬是对的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lao Yang, first name Jinwen, was a retired middle school teacher who frequently advised Zhang Yuanchao that if he wanted to enjoy his waning years, he ought to be learning new things. For example: "The Internet. Even babies can learn it, so why don't you?" He even pointed out that Zhang Yuanchao's biggest failing was that he had absolutely no interest in the outside world: "Your old lady can at least brush aside her tears while sitting in front of the TV watching those trashy soaps. But you, you don't even watch TV. You should pay attention to national and world affairs. That's part of a full life." Zhang Yuanchao may have been an old Beijinger, but he didn't seem like one. A taxi driver could hold forth with cogent analyses of domestic and world situations, but even if Zhang Yuanchao knew the current president's name, he certainly didn't know the premier's. This was actually a point of pride for him. He lived the steady-going life of a commoner, he said, and couldn't be bothered to care about such irrelevant things. They had nothing to do with him, and ignoring them rid him of a significant number of headaches in life. Yang Jinwen paid attention to affairs of state and made a point of watching the evening news every day, arguing with online commenters till he was red in the face over national economic policy and the tide of international nuclear proliferation, but what had it gotten him? The government hadn't increased his pension by even a cent. He said, "You're being ridiculous. You think it's irrelevant? That it's got nothing to do with you? Listen, Lao Zhang. Every major national and international issue, every major national policy, and every UN resolution is connected to your life, through both direct and indirect channels. You think the US invasion of Venezuela is none of your concern? I say it's got more than a penny's worth of lasting implications for your pension." At the time, Zhang had merely laughed at Lao Yang's wonkish outburst. But now he knew that his neighbor was right.</div>

A Planetary Defense Council spokesman said that the warhead-equipped interceptor successfully destroyed the three-thousand-square-meter target.

<div class="line_en">Ding Yi: It's due to a lack of common knowledge about physics. Representatives of the government and the scientific community have explained this on numerous occasions: A sophon is just a microscopic particle which, despite possessing a high intelligence, has the potential for only a limited effect on the macroscopic world due to its microscopic scale. The primary threats they pose to humanity lie in their erroneous and random interference to high-energy physics experiments, and in the quantum entanglement network that monitors Earth. In its microscopic state, a sophon cannot kill, and it cannot engage in any other offensive attack. If a sophon wants to produce a larger effect on the macroscopic world, it can only do so in a lower-dimensional unfolded state. And even in that situation, its effects are highly limited, because a sophon unfolded in lower dimensions on a macroscopic scale is very weak. Now that humanity has established a defense system, sophons cannot do this without providing us with an excellent opportunity to destroy them. I believe that the mainstream media ought to do a better job of disseminating this scientific information to the public to rid it of a panic that has no basis in science.</div>

He knew who it was from the footsteps he'd heard hammering up the staircase just before. Miao Fuquan, another neighbor on their floor, came in. A Shanxi coal boss who ran a fair number of mines in that province, Miao Fuquan was a few years younger than Zhang Yuanchao. He owned a larger home in another part of Beijing and used this apartment as a place to keep a mistress from Sichuan who was about the same age as his daughter. When he had first moved in, the Zhang and Yang families had basically ignored him save for an argument over the stuff he left strewn about the hallway, but they eventually discovered that although he was a little vulgar, he was a decent, friendly man. Once building management had smoothed over a dispute or two, harmony was gradually established among the three families. Although Miao Fuquan said he had turned over his business affairs to his son, he was still a busy man and rarely spent any time at this "home," so the three-bedroom place was usually only occupied by the Sichuan woman.</div>

Spaceships, when their day comes, will probably be even bigger and carry a larger crew than today's aircraft carriers. Future space warfare will be based on large-tonnage, high-endurance combat platforms, and engagements will resemble naval battles more than air combat, with a battlefield in three dimensions instead of two. So the military's space branch must be based upon the navy. I know, we all assumed that the foundation would be the air force, which means our naval comrades might be ill prepared. You've got to adapt as quickly as possible."</div>

It's a daunting task, since we have zero knowledge of this type of warfare, but the future space fleet will be built atop this foundation. In its preliminary stage, then, the space force will be more like a military academy. The primary task of those of us seated here is to organize that academy, and then invite a sizeable group of scholars and researchers to join up."</div>

<div class="line_en">Chang stood up and walked over to the insignia, where he addressed the assembled officers with words they would remember for the rest of their lives: "Comrades, the space force has a tough road ahead of it. Initial predictions see basic research taking at least fifty years across all disciplines, with at least another hundred years before practical use of the technology required for large-scale space travel becomes possible. Then, after its initial construction, the space fleet will require another century and a half to achieve its planned scale. That means that full combat capacity will take the space force three centuries from its establishment. Comrades, I'm sure you all understand what that means. None of us sitting here will make it to space, much less have the chance to see our space fleet, and we may not even see a credible model of a space warship. The first generation of officers and crew won't be born until two centuries from now, and two and a half centuries from that, Earth's fleet will meet the alien invaders. Aboard those ships will be the fifteenth generation of our grandchildren."</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctrine of Escapism arose alongside the Trisolar Crisis. Its primary argument holds that given the locked state of humanity's advanced sciences, it does not make any sense to plan for a defense of Earth and the Solar System in four and a half centuries. Considering the extent to which human technology can develop over the next four centuries, a more realistic goal would be to construct starships to enable a small portion of the human race to flee to outer space, thereby avoiding the total extinction of human civilization.</div>

<div class="line_en">Escapism has three possible destinations. Option one: a New World -- that is, searching among the stars for a world where humanity can survive. Without question, this is the ideal, but it requires extremely high navigation speeds and the voyage will be long. Given the level that human technology can attain during the Crisis period, this option is unlikely to be realized. Option two: a Starship Civilization -- that is, humanity will use their escape ships as a permanent abode, and human civilization will endure on an eternal voyage.</div>

<div class="line_en">This option faces the same difficulties as the New World, although it places a greater emphasis on the establishment of closed ecosystem technologies. A generation ship running a fully enclosed biosphere is far beyond humanity's current technical capabilities. Option three: Temporary Refuge. Once Trisolaris has completed settlement of the Solar System, there can be active exchanges between Trisolaran society and the humans that have fled to outer space. By pushing for a relaxation of policies toward residual humans in outer space, they will eventually be able to return to the Solar System and coexist on a smaller scale with the Trisolarans. Although Temporary Refuge is considered the most realistic plan, there are still too many variables.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not long after the emergence of Escapism, news outlets worldwide reported that the United States and Russia, two leaders in space technology, had secretly started work on plans for fleeing into outer space. Although the governments of the two countries denied the existence of any plans, an uproar in the international community sparked a "socialized technology" movement. At the third special session, a host of developing countries demanded that the United States, Russia, Japan, China, and the European Union release their technology and provide all advanced technology, including aerospace technology, free of charge to the international community so that all nations of humanity would have an equal opportunity to face the Trisolar Crisis. The supporters of the socialized technology movement brought up a precedent: At the beginning of the century, several major European pharmaceutical companies exacted high license fees from African countries for the manufacture of state-of-the-art AIDS treatments, prompting high-profile litigation. Under pressure from public opinion and the rapid spread of the disease in Africa, the companies renounced their patent rights prior to trial. The ultimate crisis that Earth is now facing means that open technology is the unavoidable responsibility that advanced countries have to all humanity. The socialized technology movement found a unanimous response from developing countries and even won the support of some members of the EU, but all related initiatives were rejected at meetings of the UN-PDC. At the fifth special session of the UN General Assembly, a proposal by China and Russia of a "limited socialized technology" plan that advocated making technology open to all permanent members of the PDC was vetoed by the US and Britain. The US government said that no form of socialized technology was realistic, that it was a naïve idea, and that under the present circumstances US national security was a priority "second only to planetary defense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="逃亡主义出现后不久，全球就有多家媒体报道：美国和俄罗斯两个空间技术大国已经秘密开始了自己的外太空逃亡计划。虽然两国政府都立刻断然否认自己存在这样的计划，仍然在国际社会引起轩然大波，并由此引发了一场“技术公有化”运动。在第三届特别联大上，许多发展中国家要求蔓、俄、日、中和欧盟进行技术公开，将包括宇航技术在内的所有先进技术无偿提供给国际社会，以使得人类所有的国家和民族在三体危机面前享有同等的机会。“技术公有化”运动的倡导者还举了一个先例：在本世纪初，欧洲几大制药公司曾向生产最先进的治疗爱滋病药物的非洲国家收取高额的技术专利费，并由此引发了一场备受关注的诉讼，面对爱滋病在非洲迅速蔓延的严峻形势，在强大的舆论压力下，几大制药公司在开庭前宣布放弃专利权。在目前世界所面临的终极危机面前，公开技术是各先进国家时全人类不可推辞的责任。“技术公有化”运动得到了发展中国家的一致响应，甚至得到了部分欧盟成员国的支持，但相关的提案在联合国行星防御理事会议上均被否决。此后，中俄两国在第五届特别联大上提出一项“有限技术公有化”提案，倡议在行星防御理事会常任理事国间进行技术公有化，也立刻遭美英两国否决。美国政府表示，任何形式的技术公有化都是不现实的，是幼稚的想法，即使在目前情况下。美国的国家安全仍处于“仅次于地球防御”的重要地位。">查看中文翻译</div>

Add to that the sheer size of our base population, and simply having enough to eat becomes a problem. And then take a look at the international situation. Developing countries don't have the ability to escape, and developed countries have refused to socialize their technology. But the poorer and smaller countries won't give up. Aren't they threatening to pull out of the Non-Proliferation Treaty? And they may take more extreme actions in the future. Who knows -- in a hundred and twenty years, before the alien fleet even arrives, the world might be engulfed in the flames of war! Who knows what sort of life your great-grandson's generation will lead. Besides, the escape ships aren't what you imagine. Comparing them to the Shenzhou spaceship and the ISS is ridiculous. The ships will be big, each of them a small city, and a complete ecosystem to boot. Just like a tiny Earth. Humanity can live on them forever without any outside supplies. And most importantly, there will be hibernation. We can do that now, even. The passengers on board will spend most of their time in hibernation, where a century feels like no more than a day, until they reach the new world or they reach an accord with the Trisolarans to return to the Solar System. Then they'll wake up. Isn't that a much better life than suffering back on Earth?"</div>

The sun, already high in the sky, shone through the curtains and turned her into a graceful projected silhouette, like a scene from a black-and-white movie he had forgotten the name of. But what he needed to remember now was her name. What was she called? Keep calm. First, her last name: If it was Zhang, then she would be Zhang Shan. Or was it Chen? Then, Chen Jingjing… no, those were previous women. He thought about looking at his phone, but it was still in his pocket and he had tossed his clothes on the carpet. Besides, they had only known each other for a little while and he hadn't entered her number into his phone yet. The important thing now was not to have it be like that one time he'd asked outright -- the consequences had been disastrous. So he turned to the television, which she had turned on and muted.

It's a question of survival, and no matter who gets to leave -- elites, the rich, or ordinary people -- so long as some people get left behind, it means the collapse of humanity's fundamental value system and ethical bottom line. Human rights and equality have deep roots. Inequality of survival is the worst sort of inequality, and the people and countries left behind will never just sit and wait for death while others have a way out.

On the day I can no longer read you or figure you out, but you can easily understand me, that's when you'll finally have grown up." And then I grew up like you said, and you could no longer so easily understand your son. I know you must have felt at least some sorrow at that. But your son is indeed becoming the kind of person you'd hoped for, someone not particularly likeable, but capable of succeeding in the complicated and dangerous realm of the navy. For me to ask this question surely means that the training you've given me for three decades has failed at the crucial juncture. But Dad, tell me anyway. Your son is not as great as you imagine. Tell me, just this once.</div>

<div class="line_en">Zhang Beihai said good-bye to his father. As he was leaving the room, he turned back at the door to look at him, shrouded in shadow now that the light of the setting sun had departed. His eyes pierced the shadows and noticed one last scrap of illumination on the wall opposite. Although it was about to fade, this was the time when the setting sun was at its most beautiful. The last rays of sunlight shone, too, on the waves that rolled endlessly on the angry ocean and in shafts of light that pierced the jumbled clouds in the west and cast enormous golden bands on the water's surface like petals fallen from heaven. Beyond the petals, dark clouds loomed over a world black as night as a thunderstorm hung between heaven and earth like the curtain of the gods, and only periodic lightning lit the snowlike spray thrown up by the waves. In one golden band, a destroyer struggled to lift its prow from the trough, and then broke through the wall of the wave with a thunderous crash, the spray greedily absorbing the light like a giant roc stretching enormous glittering wings to the sky.</div>

They entered the old-style elevator and began to ascend immediately, accompanied by a tremendous scraping. The operator was a People's Armed Police soldier armed with a submachine gun.

In front of him was a large aircraft that looked like a passenger plane, except that there was no insignia on any part he could see. An airstair stood in front of the car door, and Shi Qiang and Luo Ji took it up to the aircraft. When Luo Ji glanced back out the door after they entered, the first thing that caught his eye were the fighter jets lined up on a distant apron, which informed him that this wasn't a civilian airport.

But soon the noise and vibration of the engine reminded him he was aboard a plane taxiing down the runway, and a few minutes later the engine noise changed and the two of them were pressed back into the sofa. Then the ground vibrations disappeared and the office floor took on a slant.

<div class="line_en">Wu Yue dropped his cold mask and met Zhang Beihai's gaze. "Beihai, you used to be a practical person. You opposed building Tang, and on multiple occasions, on the record, voiced doubts about building a blue-water navy, arguing that it was incompatible with our national strength. You believe that our naval forces ought to remain in coastal waters under the support and protection of shore-based firepower, an idea ridiculed as a turtle-shell strategy by the young hotheads, but you've persisted in it… So where do you get your confidence in a space victory from now? Do you really believe that wooden boats can sink an aircraft carrier?"</div>

A wooden boat could carry a small squad of divers who'll wait in the carrier's path. When the enemy draws near, they'll dive in and the boat will leave. Then when the carrier comes close, they'll attach a bomb to the bottom of the hull and sink the carrier… Of course this would be exceedingly difficult, but it's not impossible."</div>

It's hard to explain anything more complicated. We'll start with the gentlest one, which happens to be the simplest: The List. That means drawing up a whole list of questions connected to the case, and then asking them one by one and recording the subject's answers, and then starting over again from the top and recording those answers too. Questions can be asked repeatedly if necessary, and then you can compare the transcripts of the answers and find out if the subject is lying about something, since the answers will be different every time. The technique is simple, but don't look down your nose at it. No one who hasn't undergone training in counter-interrogation techniques will be able to pass it, so the most effective way of dealing with The List is simply to remain silent."

<div class="line_en">"The next technique is only half-gentle. You can reach the ashtray -- it's fixed in place, you've just got to pull it up. Right. This technique is called Black and White. It requires the cooperation of lots of people and is a little more complicated. First, the bad cops come out, at least two of them on most occasions, and they're really nasty to you. Some of them verbally and others physically, but they're all mean. There's a strategy to it: not just to make you afraid, but more importantly to make you feel alone, to make you feel like the whole world wants to consume you. Then the good cop comes out, just one, and he's got a kind face, and he stops the bad cops and tells them that you're a human being, that you've got rights, so how can they treat you that way? The bad cops tell him to beat it, that he's affecting their work. The good cop persists, and says, 'You can't do this!' The bad cops say, 'I always knew you didn't have the stones for this work. If you can't handle it, then get lost.' The good cop shields you with his body, and says, 'I'm going to protect his rights, and protect justice under the law!' The bad cops say, 'Tomorrow you're out of here, just you wait!' Then they leave in a huff. So it's just the two of you left, and the good cop wipes off your blood and sweat and tells you not to be afraid, and that you have the right to be silent! Then, as you can imagine, he becomes your one friend in the world, so when he draws you out, you aren't silent anymore… This technique is most effective against intellectuals, but it differs from The List in that it loses its effect when you're aware of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“下一个，半文半武的。你能够着烟灰缸吧，固定着的，得拔下来，好。这一招叫黑白脸。这种审讯需要多人配合，稍复杂一些。首先是黑脸出来，一般是两人以上。他们对你很凶，可能动文的也可能动武的，反正很凶。这也是有策略的，不仅仅是让你产生恐惧，更重要的是激发你的孤独感，让你感觉全世界除了想吃你的狼就再没别的了。这时白脸出来了，肯定只有一个人，而且肯定长得慈眉善目，他制止了黑脸们，说你也是一个人，有人的权利，你们怎么能这样对待他？黑脸们说你走开，不要影响工作。白脸坚持，说你们真的不能这样做！黑脸们说早就知道你干不了这个，干不了走人啊！白脸用身体护住你说：我要保护他的权利，保护法律的公正！黑脸们说你等着，明天你就滚蛋了！然后气哼哼地走了。就剩你们俩时，白脸会替你擦擦汗呀血呀的，说别怕，有我在，他们不敢把你怎么样。不管我落到什么下场，定会维护你的权利！你不想说就别说了，你有权沉默！接下来的事儿你就能想得出了，他这时成了你在这个世界上唯一的最亲的人，在他进一步的利诱下，你是不会沉默的……这一招对付知识分子最管用，但与前面拉单子不同，你一旦知道了，它就失效了。当然，以上讲的一般都不单独使用，真正的审讯是一个大工程，是多种技术的综合……”">查看中文翻译</div>

He unbuckled the sleeping bag and crawled out, then pushed up the shade over the window by the bed. Outside, the moon was shining on a sea of clouds, a vast ocean of silver. Luo Ji realized that above the clouds were other things shining with a silver light, four ramrod-straight lines that caught the eye against the backdrop of the night sky. They were extending at the same speed as the plane, and their trailing ends faded out and blended into the night like four silver swords flying over the clouds. Luo Ji looked back at the tips and noticed that the silver lines were being drawn out by four objects with a metallic glint. Four fighter jets. It wasn't hard to guess that another four were on the other side of the plane.</div>

"Please forgive me for speaking pointedly. For one thing, we've been in meetings all day and we're all tired, so no one will listen if I'm not blunt." A few people laughed, but the rest were still mired in their fatigue. "More importantly, I'm truly worried. The battle we are facing has a force disparity unprecedented in the history of human warfare, so I believe that for the indefinite future the greatest danger facing the space force is defeatism.

He completely neglects the human role in battle, particularly in his lack of understanding of the unique advantages formed in our army by difficult historical conditions. When he learned of the Trisolar Crisis, he lost all confidence in the future, and once he joined the space force, this despair only became more pronounced. Comrade Wu Yue's defeatist sentiment is so heavy and ingrained that we have no hope of pulling him out of it.

<div class="line_en">So he began constructing a character. He first imagined her face, and then designed her clothes, and then thought of her environment and the people around her, and finally placed her in that environment and had her move about and speak, letting her live. But this soon turned tedious, and he told Bai Rong about the difficulties he had encountered: "She's like a puppet on a string. Every word and action arises from the design but lacks the spark of life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，罗辑开始构思这个人物。他首先想象她的容貌。然后为她设计衣着，接着设想她所处的环境和她周围的人。最后把她放到这个环境中，让她活动和说话。让她生活。很快，这事变得索然无味了，他向白蓉述说了自己遇到的困境。“她好像是一个提线木偶，每个动作和每一句话都来自于我的设想，缺少一种生命感。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So he followed her advice. He threw out everything he wanted to write and instead imagined the character's entire life and every detail of it. He imagined her nursing at her mother's breast, her tiny mouth sucking energetically and burbling with satisfaction; chasing a red balloon tumbling down the street but making it just one step before falling to the ground, wailing as she watched the balloon drift away without realizing that she had just taken her first step; walking in the rain and impulsively folding up her umbrella to feel the raindrops; her first day at elementary school, sitting alone in a strange classroom, unable to see her parents through the windows or door, and nearly starting to cry, only to realize that her best friend from kindergarten was at a nearby desk, and crying in joy instead; her first night at college, lying on her dorm bunk and watching the shadows of trees thrown by streetlamps onto the ceiling… He imagined every one of her favorite foods, the color and style of every item of clothing in her dresser, the decorations on her mobile phone, the books she read, the music on her media player, the Web sites she visited, the movies she liked; but never her makeup, because she didn't need makeup… Like a creator outside of time, he wove the different stages of her life together and gradually came to discover the endless pleasure of creation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是罗辑照白蓉说的做了，完全抛开自己要写的内容，去想象她的整个人生，想象她人生中的每一个细节。他想象她在妈妈的怀中吃奶，小嘴使劲吮着，发出满意的晤晤声；想象雨中漫步的她突然收起了伞，享受着和雨丝接触的感觉；想象她追一个在地上滚的红色气球，仅追了一步就摔倒了，看着远去的气球哇哇大哭。完全没有意识到她刚才迈出的是人生的第一步；想象她上小学的第一天，孤独地坐在陌生教室的第三排，从门口和窗子都看不到爸爸妈妈了，就在她要哭出来时，发现邻桌是幼儿同的同学，高兴地叫起来；想象大学的第一个夜晚，她躺在宿舍的上铺，看着路灯投在天花板上的树影……罗辑想象出她爱吃的每一样东西，想象她的衣橱中每一件衣服的颜色和样式，想象她手机上的小饰物，想象她看的书她的MP4中的音乐她上的网站她喜欢的电影，但从未想象过她用什么化妆品，她不需要化妆品……罗辑像一个时间之上的创造者，同时在她生命中的不同时空编织着她的人生。他渐渐对这种创造产生了兴趣，乐此不疲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She said, "Your approach is wrong. You're writing an essay rather than creating a literary figure. What a literary character does in ten minutes might be a reflection of ten years' experience. You can't be limited to the plot of a novel -- you've got to imagine her entire life, and what actually gets put into words is just the tip of the iceberg."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白蓉说：“你的方法不对，你是在作文，不是在创造文学形象。要知道，一个文学人物十分钟的行为，可能是她十年的经历的反映。你不要局限于小说的情节，要去想象她的整个生命，而真正写成文字的只是冰山的一角。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The snow and wind picked up, temperatures plummeted, and he watched from the warmth of his dorm the bluster that blanketed the other sounds of the city, the buffeting of the snowflakes on the widow like the patter of sand. A huge carpet of snow covered everything outdoors. The city seemed to no longer exist, leaving the faculty dormitory standing on an infinite snowy plain. He went back to bed, but before he drifted off to sleep he had a sudden thought: If she were outside in this awful weather, she would be terribly cold. Then he reminded himself: It doesn't matter, she won't be outside unless you put her there. But this time his imagination failed, and she continued walking outside in the blizzard like a blade of grass that could blow away at any moment. She still wore that white coat and that red scarf, which was all he could make out, vaguely, through the swirling snow, like a tiny flame fighting against the storm.</div>

The snowflakes in her hair quickly melted into gleaming droplets as she unwrapped her scarf and put her hands to her mouth to blow on them.

He walked excitedly down the road to the classroom building, and though the air was hazy after the snowfall, he felt like he could see a thousand miles.

Then they went down a riverbed that was practically dried up, with only a thin stream of water flowing down the center. But it was a northern river all the same, and so they picked up small chilly smooth stones from the riverbed and pitched them in, watching the cloudy yellow water gush out of the holes they broke in the thin ice. They passed a small town and spent a while at the market there. She knelt down by a goldfish vendor, the fish in their glass bowls like liquid flames under the sun, and wouldn't leave. He bought her two and put them, water and all, in plastic bags on the backseat of the car. They entered a hamlet, but found nothing that felt like the countryside. The houses and compounds were brand new, cars were parked outside of many of the gates, the cement roads were wide, and people were dressed no differently than in the cities -- a few girls were even stylish. Even the dogs were the same long-haired, short-legged parasites found in the cities. More interesting was the large stage at the entrance to the village -- they marveled at how such a small village could have such an immense stage. It was empty, so with some effort he climbed up and -- looking down at his lone audience member -- sang a verse from "Tonkaya Ryabina" about the slender hawthorn tree. At noon, they ate in another town, where the food was more or less the same as in the city, only the portions were about twice as large. After lunch, they sat drowsily in the warmth of the sun on a bench outside the town hall, and then drove onward with no direction in mind.</div>

Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, the mountains, weary of standing, had lain down, sunken into flatness amid time and sunlight, and turned anyone walking among them just as indolent. "The mountains here are like old villagers basking in the sun," she said, but they hadn't seen any of those old men in the villages they passed through; none more at ease than the mountains. More than once their car had been stopped by a flock of sheep crossing the road. Beside the road there at last appeared the kind of villages they had imagined, with cave houses and persimmon and walnut trees and stone-tiled low buildings, roofs piled high with stripped corn cob. Even the dogs were larger and more fierce.</div>

Thinking back to their takeoff time, he had a pretty good idea of which general area of the globe they were in. The fog was thick, and the lights shone a dim yellow as events from their takeoff seemed to be replaying before their eyes: the patrol helicopters in the air, only dimly visible through the fog as shadows with glowing lights; the plane quickly surrounded by a ring of military vehicles and outward-facing soldiers; and several officers with radios clustered in a group discussing something and occasionally throwing a glance in the direction of the airstair. A buzzing from somewhere overhead set Luo Ji's scalp on fire, and even the imperturbable Mr. Kent covered his years. Looking up, they could see an indistinct light flying low overhead: the escort formation, still circling above them, its exhaust tracing a large circle in the air that was hazily visible through the fog, as if a cosmic giant had tagged the Earth with chalk at this very spot.</div>

Just as the bizarre tension had pushed him almost to the breaking point, the men in front of him gave way. Light flashed before his eyes, and then the rest of them halted in their steps, leaving him, Shi Qiang, and Kent to continue forward. They were walking in a large quiet hall, empty but for a few black-clothed guards who spoke quietly into a handheld radio each time the three of them passed one of them. They crossed a hanging balcony in the direction of a stained-glass panel whose riot of colors and intricate lines described the distorted shapes of humans and animals.

Straight ahead of him, the tall yellow wall inset with the UN insignia that served as a backdrop for the podium was tilted forward at an acute angle, like a cliff face that was liable to collapse at any time. The dome, built to resemble a starry sky, was structurally separate from the yellow wall and did nothing to stabilize it, acting instead as an immense weight bearing down from above, adding to the wall's instability and lending the whole environment the overpowering feeling of being ready to tumble down at any moment. Under the present circumstances, however, it seemed as if the eleven architects who had designed the building in the mid-twentieth century had wonderfully predicted humanity's present predicament.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the secretary general uttered his name, Tyler stood up from his seat in the first row and walked with deliberate steps up to the rostrum, where he looked down at the assembly without expression. There was no applause as everyone sat in silence and stared at the First Wallfacer. Tyler's tall, thin body and square-framed glasses were well known across the world. The recently retired US secretary of defense, he had exerted a deep influence on his country's national strategy. His ideological focus was expressed in a book titled The Truth of Technology, in which he argued that small countries are the ultimate beneficiaries of technology, and that the unstinting efforts toward technological development on the part of larger countries was in fact paving the way for world dominance by the smaller ones. This was because technological progress rendered the population and resource advantages of larger countries unimportant, but provided small countries with leverage to move the world. One consequence of nuclear technology was that it allowed a country of just a few million people to pose a substantial threat to one with a hundred million, something that at one time had been practically impossible. One of his key points was that the advantages of a large country were only truly advantageous in low-technology eras and would ultimately be weakened by the swift pace of technological progress, which would meanwhile enhance the strategic weight of small countries. Some might experience a sudden rise, gaining world dominance like Spain and Portugal once did. There was no question that Tyler's thinking provided a theoretic foundation for the United States' global war on terror. But he was not just a strategist. He was also a man of action, and on multiple occasions had won popular acclaim for demonstrating courage and foresight in the face of major threats. Hence, as far as both the depth of his thinking and his leadership were concerned, Tyler made a worthy Wallfacer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="秘书长的话音刚落，泰勒从第一排座位上站了起来，步伐从容地走上主席台，目无表情地面对会场，没有掌声，所有人只是在一片寂静中把目光聚焦到第一位面壁者身上。泰勒身材瘦长，戴着宽框眼镜，这个形象早已为全世界熟悉。他是刚刚卸任的美国国防部长，是一个对美国国家战略产生深刻影响的人。他的思想集中体现在一本名叫《技术的真相》的着作中，泰勒认为，技术的最终受益者将是小国家。大国不遗余力发展技术，实际上是为小国通向世界霸权铺下基石。因为随着技术的发展，大国所拥有的人口和资源优势将不再重要，而技术对小国而言是一个可能撬动地球的杠杆。核技术的后果之一就是使一个人口只有几百万的小国有可能对一个人口过亿的大国产生实质性威胁，而在核技术出现之前，这几乎是不可能的。泰勒的一个重要论点是：大国的优势，其实只有在低技术时代才是真正的优势，技术的飞速发展最终将削弱大国的优势，同时提升小国的战略分量，有可能使得某些小周突然崛起，像当年的西班牙和葡萄牙那样取得世界霸权。泰勒的思想，无疑为美国的全球反恐战略提供了理论基础。泰勒不仅是一个战略理论家，同时也是一个行动的巨人，他在处理多次重大危机时所表现出来的果敢和远见，赢得了广泛的赞誉。所以，无论在思想的深度还是领导的能力上，泰勒作为面壁者是当之无愧的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When this brown-skinned, stocky South American with a stubborn look in his eyes ascended the rostrum, Luo Ji was surprised: It was highly unusual for this man to even appear at the UN. But on second thought, it stood to reason. He even wondered why it hadn't already occurred to him. Rey Diaz was the current president of Venezuela, which, under his leadership, had aptly demonstrated Tyler's theory about the rise of small countries. He carried forward the Bolivarian Revolution instigated by Hugo Chavez: In a contemporary world ruled by capitalism and market economics, he promoted in Venezuela what Chavez called Socialism of the Twenty-First Century, founded on lessons drawn from the experience of the international socialist movements of the previous century.

<div class="line_en">Rey Diaz inherited not only Chavez's socialist ideology but his strong anti-Americanism, which reminded the United States that its Latin American backyard could become a second Soviet Union if left unchecked. A rare opportunity presented by an accident and a misunderstanding gave the United States the excuse to launch a full-scale invasion of Venezuela that sought to overthrow the Rey Diaz government along the Iraq model. But with this war, the post-Cold War streak of victories by major western powers over small Third World countries had finally broken. When the US Army entered Venezuela, it discovered that the uniformed military was nowhere to be found. The entire army had been divided by squad into guerilla teams concealed among the people, and their sole combat objective was killing the enemy's vital forces. Rey Diaz's basic approach to warfare was built atop a single, clear idea: Modern high-tech weapons might be useful against point targets, but, for area targets, their performance is no better than conventional weapons and their cost and limited quantity make them essentially nonfactors. He was a genius at low-cost, high-tech exploits. At the turn of the century, an Australian engineer had built a cruise missile for five thousand dollars with the aim of boosting vigilance against terrorists, but Rey Diaz's thousands of guerilla teams were armed with a total of two hundred thousand of them, mass produced for just three thousand dollars apiece. Although the missiles were made out of parts that were cheap and widely available on the market, they were fully equipped with a radar altimeter and GPS and could hit targets within a five-kilometer radius at an accuracy of within five meters. Their hit rate may have been less than 10 percent during the war, but they caused enormous destruction to the enemy. Other mass-produced high-tech gadgets, like proximity-fuse sniper rifle bullets, had a similarly brilliant track record during the war. During its short time in Venezuela, the US Army suffered casualties that approached Vietnam War levels, and it eventually had to withdraw. The defeat of the strong at the hands of the weak made Rey Diaz a hero for the twenty-first century.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷迪亚兹不仅继承了查韦斯的社会主义思想，也继承了后者强烈的反美颂向，这使美国意识到，如果再任其发展，自己的拉丁美洲后院有可能变成第二个苏联。在一次因意外和误会产生的千载难逢的借口出现时，美国立刻发动了对委内瑞拉的全面入侵，企图依照伊拉克模式彻底推翻雷迪亚兹政府。但这次战争中止了自冷战结束以来西方大国对第三世界小国的战无不胜的势头。当美军进入委内瑞拉之际，发现这个国家穿军装的军队已经消失了，整个陆军被拆分成了以班为单位的游击小组，全部潜伏于民间，以杀伤敌军有生力量为唯一的作战目标。雷迪亚兹的基本作战思想建立在这样一个明确的理念之上：现代高技术武器主要是用于对付集中式的点状目标的，对于面积目标，它们的效能并不比传统武器高，加上造价和数量的限制，基本上难以发挥作用。雷迪亚兹还是一名少花钱利用高技术的天才。在本世纪初，曾有一名澳大利亚工程师，出于引起大众对恐怖分子的警惕的目的，仅花了五千美元就造出了一枚巡航导弹。到了雷迪亚兹那里，批量生产使其造价降到了三千美元，共生产了二十万枚这样的巡航导弹装备那几千个游击小组。这些导弹使用的部件虽然都是市场上便宜的大路货，但五脏俱全，具备测高雷达和全球定位功能，在五公里的范围内命中精度不超过五米。在整个战争中虽然只有不到十分之一的导弹命中了目标，但也给敌人造成了巨大的杀伤。雷迪亚兹还在战争中大量使用其他一些可以大批量生产的高科技小玩意儿，如装有近炸引信的狙击步枪子弹等等，同样取得了辉煌的战绩。美军在委内瑞拉战争中的伤亡在短时间内就达到了越战的水平，只得以惨败退出。雷迪亚兹也因此成为二十一世纪以弱胜强的英雄。">查看中文翻译</div>

He, too, was well known to the world, although he lacked the aura of the other two men. Hines's life was split into two entirely distinct stages. As a scientist, he was the only person in history to be nominated for the Nobel Prize in two sciences simultaneously for the same discovery. During research conducted with the neuroscientist Keiko Yamasuki, he discovered that brain activity for thoughts and memories operated on the quantum level rather than on the molecular level as previously believed. This discovery pushed brain mechanisms downward to the microstate of matter, rendering all prior research nothing more than superficial attempts that merely skimmed the surface of neuroscience. This discovery also demonstrated that the animal brain's capacity to process information was several orders of magnitude higher than previously imagined, which lent credence to long-held speculation that the brain had a holographic structure. Hines was nominated for Nobel Prizes in both Physics and Physiology or Medicine for the discovery. Although his work was too radical for him to win either award, Keiko Yamasuki -- who by this time was his wife -- won the prize in Physiology or Medicine that year for her application of the theory to the treatment of amnesia and mental illness.</div>

Then the official had turned back to the group of uniformed, ramrod-straight generals and, groveling like a dog, had led them past the sentry post to the viewing platform. Ringier and his colleagues were forced to remain at this far-off spot where, in the previous century, a countdown clock had been built across a lake from the launch site.

The floodlights did not follow the rocket as it lifted off, leaving its massive body indistinct except for the spurting flames.

Luo Ji passed through their midst, saying nothing. He walked through the bare lobby, occupied as on his arrival only by black-clothed guards.

In his trance, he had lost the capacity for rational thought and was unaware of where he came from, much less where he was going. Unwittingly, he walked onto the lawn and came to a statue. When his gaze passed over it, he noticed that it was of a man hammering a sword: Let Us Beat Swords into Plowshares. It had been a gift to the UN from the former Soviet Union, but to his mind the powerful composition formed by the hammer, the bulky man, and the sword being bent beneath him imbued the work with hints of violence.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the man with the hammer was smacking Luo Ji savagely in the chest with a fierce blow that sent him tumbling to the ground and knocked him out before he even hit the grass. But the shock passed quickly, and soon partial consciousness returned amid pain and dizziness. He had to shut his eyes against the blinding flashlights that were all around him. Then the rings of light receded and he could make out a circle of faces over him. In the black cloud of haze and agony he recognized Shi Qiang the moment he heard his voice:</div>

<div class="line_en">Luo Ji nodded weakly. Then everything happened in a flash. He felt himself lifted onto what seemed like a stretcher, and then the stretcher was hoisted up. He was surrounded by a tight clutch of people, as if he was in a narrow pit with walls formed by human bodies. The only thing visible out of the mouth of the pit was the black night sky, and it was only from the motion of the legs of the people surrounding him that he could tell he was being carried. Soon the pit vanished, as did the sky above him, replaced by the lit ceiling panels of an ambulance. He tasted blood in his mouth and then emptied his stomach in a bout of nausea. Someone beside him caught his vomit -- blood and what he had eaten on the plane -- in a plastic bag with a practiced hand. After he vomited, someone strapped an oxygen mask to his face. When he could breathe easier he felt a little better, although his chest still hurt. He felt his clothes getting cut off at the chest, and imagined in a panic that fresh blood was spurting from a wound, but that didn't seem to be right, since no bandaging seemed to be taking place. He was covered in a blanket. Not long after that, the vehicle stopped. He was carried out, and the night sky and the lit ceilings of hospital corridors passed over him, then the ceiling of an emergency room, and then, moving slowly overhead, the glowing red slit of the CT scanner. Faces of doctors and nurses occasionally popped into view and caused him pain with their inspections and manipulation of his chest. Finally, when he could see the ceiling of the ward overhead, everything settled down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗辑无力地点点头。然后一切都是闪电般迅速，他感到自己被抬起，好像是放到了担架上，然后担架被抬起来。他的周围一直紧紧地围着一圈人，他感到自己是处于一个由人的身体构成四壁的窄坑中，由于“坑”口上方能看到的只有黑色的夜空，他只能从围着他的人们腿部的动作上判断自己是在被抬着走。很快，“坑”消失了，上方的夜空也消失了，代之以亮着灯的救护车顶板。罗辑感到自己的嘴里有血腥味，他一阵恶心翻身吐了出来，旁边的人很专业地用一个塑料袋接住他的呕吐物，吐出来的除了血还有在飞机上吃进去的东西。吐过之后，有人把氧气面罩扣在他的脸上，呼吸顺畅后他感觉舒服了一些，但胸部的疼痛依旧，他感觉胸前的衣服被撕开了，惊恐地想象着那里的伤口涌出的鲜血，但好像不是那么回事，他们没有进行包扎之类的处理，只是把毯子盖到他身上。时间不长，车停了，罗辑被从车里抬出来，向上看到夜空和医院走廊的顶部依次移去，然后看到的是急救室的天花板，CT扫描仪那道发着红光的长缝从他的上方缓缓移过，这期间医生和护士的脸不时在上方出现，他们在检查和处理他的胸部时弄得他很疼。最后，当他的上方是病房的天花板时，一切都安定下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Two scenes alternated in his dreams: the rostrum of the UN assembly hall looming above him, and the man from Let Us Beat Swords into Plowshares swinging a hammer into him over and over. Later, he came to the quiet patch of snow deep in his heart and entered the simple, exquisite cabin. The Eve of his own creation stood up from the fireplace, her beautiful eyes brimming with tears… Then he woke up and felt tears in his own eyes and a spot of wetness on the pillow.

<div class="line_en">Luo Ji saw a bright and clean hallway that was completely empty except for two more armed guards at the very end. He shut the door, went over to the window, and drew back the curtain. Looking down from this height he saw that guards armed to the teeth were posted all over the hospital entrance, and two green military vehicles were parked out front. Apart from the occasional white-clothed hospital staffer hurrying in or out, he saw no one else. Looking more carefully, he noticed that on the roof of the building opposite were two people surveying the surroundings through binoculars next to a sniper rifle, and he was instinctively certain that similar snipers were on the roof of his own building.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took just an instant for Luo Ji to comprehend the true nature of his status as Wallfacer. Like Say had said, before the mission was handed down, the ones who would undertake it could not have been consulted. And once the Wallfacer mission and identity were granted, they could not be refused or abandoned. This impossibility was not due to any individual's coercion, but because cold logic, as determined by the project's very nature, meant that once someone became a Wallfacer, an invisible and impenetrable screen was immediately thrown up between them and ordinary people that made their every action significant. And that was what the smiles directed at Wallfacers meant:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仅一瞬间，罗辑就悟出了面壁者这个身份的实质。正如萨伊曾说过的，这种使命在被交付前，是不可能向要承担它的人征求意见的；而面壁者的使命和身份一旦被赋予，也不可能拒绝或放弃。这种不可能并非来自于谁的强制，而是一个由面壁计划的本质所决定的冷酷逻辑，因为当一个人成为面壁者后，一层无形的不可穿透的屏障就立刻在他与普通人之间建立起来，他的一切行为就具有了面壁计划的意义，正像那对面壁者的微笑所表达的含义：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Say nodded again. "That certainly can be done, but I advise you to accept your current protection, because it is more specialized and reliable than the NYPD."</div>

<div class="line_en">The slight smile on Say's face was familiar. He had seen the same smile on the face of the young assailant, and in the future he would see it in the eyes and on the face of everyone he met. The smile would come to be called "the Wallfacer smile," and it would be as famous as the smile of the Mona Lisa or the grin of the Cheshire cat. Say's smile calmed him down at last, the first time he had been truly calm since before she had stood on the rostrum and announced to the world that he was a Wallfacer. He sat slowly down on the sofa, and by the time he got situated, he understood everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗辑发现，萨伊脸上的微笑很熟悉，这种微笑他在那个年轻的凶手脸上也见过，以后，他也将会在每一个面对他的人的脸上和目光中看到。这微笑后来被称为“对面壁者的笑”，它将与蒙娜丽莎的微笑和柴郡猫的露齿笑一样著名。萨伊的微笑终于让罗辑冷静下来，这是自她在特别联大主席台上对全世界宣布他成为面壁者以来，他第一次真正的冷静。他在沙发上缓缓地坐下，刚刚坐稳，就明白了一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was surrounded by security guards the entire way, and though he pushed them impatiently a few times, they stuck to him like magnets and followed him wherever he went.

<div class="line_en">When he saw the oblong slab of iron ore for a second time, his first instinct was to dash himself into it headfirst and put an end to everything. Instead he lay down on the stone's smooth surface, whose coolness drained off some of the irritation from his mind. With his body, he felt the hardness of the ore and, weirdly, thought of a problem put forth by his high school physics teacher: How can you make a marble bed as soft as a Simmons mattress? The answer: Dig out a depression in that marble the exact size and shape of a human body. Then when you lie in that depression, the pressure will be evenly distributed and it would feel incredibly soft. He closed his eyes and imagined that the warmth of his body was melting the iron ore beneath him and forming that kind of depression… Gradually, this calmed him.

In fact, an important part of his mandate was to act in such a way as to keep others guessing, and furthermore, to do as much as possible to engender misunderstandings. Never in human history had there been such a thing! Maybe the absolute monarchs of old had been able to do whatever they wished, but even they ultimately had to account for their actions.</div>

In propulsion, for example, there's no reason at all to work on the fission drive, but right now they're not only throwing huge amounts of R&amp;D at it, they're even putting the same amount of effort into studying next-gen chemical propulsion! We should focus our resources on studying fusion engines, and move directly to the development of media-free fusion engines, leapfrogging media-based fusion.

Sealed ecosystems, for instance, are a necessary technology for interstellar spacecraft, one that is not particularly dependent on fundamental theory, but research in this area is very limited."</div>

And he hadn't dared permit himself to imagine such an immaculate environment. Everything seemed to have sprung out of a fairy tale. There was a slight sweetness to the fresh air, and even the sun seemed to be cautious, sending the softest and most exquisite part of its glow into this place.

Despite the bright lights affixed to the rock walls of this mountain cave, it was dark here -- quite dark, in fact -- because the light was absorbed by the walls. He smelled antiseptic, and noticed the cave was set up like a field hospital, with lots of open aluminum cases containing neatly packed drugs, as well as oxygen tanks, small UV disinfectant cabinets, mobile shadowless operating lamps, and several portable medical devices that looked like X-ray machines and defibrillators. It looked like it had just been unpacked and could be re-boxed at any time.

They weren't in white lab coats, but they were definitely a doctor and a nurse.</div>

The secretary of defense had prayed on many an occasion that an American cruise missile or Special Forces bullet would drop on the man's head before he died of natural causes, even if it happened just a minute before death. Natural death would be the man's greatest triumph, and mark the failure of the war on terror. Even now, the man was edging close to glory. There had been opportunities, of course: Once a Predator drone had snapped his picture in the courtyard of a mosque in the mountains of northern Afghanistan. Simply crashing the drone into him would have made history, not to mention the fact that it had been carrying Hellfire missiles that day. But the young officer on duty lacked the courage to make a unilateral decision once he made the positive ID. Instead, he had reported it up the command chain, and when they checked again the target was gone.
