<div class="line_en">Now it happened one day that the golden ball, instead of falling back into the maiden's little hand which had sent it aloft, dropped to the ground near the edge of the well and rolled in. The King's daughter followed it with her eyes as it sank, but the well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen. Then she began to weep, and she wept and wept as if she could never be comforted. And in the midst of her weeping she heard a voice saying to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the old times, when peo ple could have all they wished, there lived a King whose daughters were all handsome, but the youngest was so beautiful that the sun himself, who has seen so much, wondered each time he shone over her because of her beauty. Near the royal castle there was a great dark wood, and in the wood under an old linden tree was a well; and when the day was hot, the King's daughter used to go forth into the wood and sit by the brink of the cool well, and if the time seemed long, she would take out a golden ball, and throw it up and catch it again, and this was her favorite pastime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在人们还可以实现愿望的古代，那时候有个国王，他有好几位公主。 虽然每位公主都貌美如花，但是她们中的小公主更是光艳照人，连见过很多世面的太阳，在每次向她洒下万道金光时，也因她的美而惊奇不已。 在国王城堡附近有一片广阔无垠的黑森林。在林中的一棵老菩堤树下，有一口水井。 天气炎热时，小公主总会到林中的那口井边，坐在凉爽的井台上。 如果呆的时间比较长，她还会拿出一个金球，在手里抛上抛下，这是她最喜欢的游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

And it came to pass that, with her father's consent, they became bride and bridegroom. And he told her how a wicked witch had bound him by her spells, and how no one but she alone could have released him, and that they two would go together to his father's kingdom. And there came to the door a carriage drawn by eight white horses, with white plumes on their heads, and with golden harness, and behind the carriage was standing faithful Henry, the servant of the young prince. Now, faithful Henry had suffered such care and pain when his master was turned into a frog, that he had been obliged to wear three iron bands over his heart, to keep it from breaking with trouble and anxiety. When the carriage started to take the prince to his kingdom, and faithful Henry had helped them both in, he got up behind, and was full of joy at his master's deliverence. And when they had gone a part of the way, the prince heard a sound at the back of the carriage, as if something had broken, and he turned round and cried:</div>
