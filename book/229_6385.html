<div class="line_en">Farmers always gave a special supper to the sheep shearers when they had finished their work. This year Bathsheba had ordered her maids to put a long table in the garden, with the top end of the table just inside the house. The farm workers took their seats, and she sat at the top of the table, so that she was with them, but a little apart. There was an empty place at the bottom of the table. At first she asked Gabriel to sit there, but just then Mr Boldwood arrived, apologizing for his lateness.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Gabriel," said Bathsheba, "will you move again please, and let Mr Boldwood sit there?" Gabriel moved away in silence to another seat. They all ate and drank, and celebrated the end of the sheep-shearing by singing their favourite songs. Mr Boldwood seemed unusually cheerful, and at the end of the meal he left his seat and went to join Bathsheba at her end of the table, just inside the sitting-room. It was growing dark, but Gabriel and the other men could not avoid noticing how Boldwood looked at her. It was clear that the middle-aged farmer was deeply in love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“盖伯瑞尔，”芭丝谢芭说，“请你再动一下，让伯德伍德先生坐在那里好吗？”盖伯瑞尔默默地移到了另一个座位上。人们一边吃喝，一边唱着自己喜爱的歌曲，庆祝剪羊毛的结束。伯德伍德好像异常兴奋，宴会快结束时，他离开他的座位，到位于起居室的桌子上端，和芭丝谢芭坐在了一起。天渐渐黑了，盖伯瑞尔和其他人都注意到伯德伍德看芭丝谢芭的样子。很显然，这位中年农场主坠入了情网。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't ask for anything more. I can wait. Goodnight, Miss Everdene!" And he left her.

<div class="line_en">That evening she went round the farm as usual, lighting her lamp whenever necessary, to check that all the animals were safe. On her way back, she was walking along the narrow public path which led to her house. It was very dark there, among the trees, and she was a little surprised to hear some footsteps coming towards her. It was unfortunate that she would meet the traveller at the darkest point of the path. As she was about to pass the dark shape, something seemed to attach her skirt to the ground, and she had to stop "What's happened? Have I hurt you, friend?" a man asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，她像通常一样到农场各处去查看是否所有的牲口都安然无恙。她不时地把灯点着。回去的时候，她沿着一条能通到她的屋子的小路走着。小路从树林中穿过，所以很黑。听到有脚步声走来，她有点吃惊。糟糕的是她与这位旅行者相遇的地方恰好是路上最黑的地方。她正要与那个黑色人影擦肩而过时，地面上有什么东西挂住了她的裙子，她只好站祝“怎么了？我伤着你了吗，朋友？”一个男人的声音问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah! You're a lady! The spur on my boot has got tied up with your dress. Have you got a lamp? I'll light it for you."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想让你看我的脸，”她冷冷地说，红了脸。“请你赶快松开你的马刺！”他弯腰慢慢地拉他的靴子。“你把事情搞得更糟了，”她生气地指责，“让我在这儿呆这么久！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've seen many women in my life," continued the young man, staring into her face, "but I've never seen a woman as beautiful as you. I don't care if you're offended, that's the truth."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh no, surely not," smiled the soldier. "Don't be angry. I was doing it so that I could have the pleasure of apologizing to such a lovely woman." Bathsheba had no idea what to say. She wondered whether to escape by pulling the material away, but did not want to tear her best dress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不，我没有那个意思，”土兵笑着说。“别生气。我这样做就有机会向一位可爱的女人道歉，这是我很乐意做的。”芭丝谢芭不知说什么好。她在想是否该拽出裙子，赶快走开，可她不想撕坏自己最好的裙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"People know me in Weatherbury. My name's Sergeant Troy. Ah, you see, your skirt's free now! I wish you and I had been tied together for ever!"</div>

<div class="line_en">She pulled her dress quickly away from his spurs, and ran up the path and into her house. The next day she discovered from Liddy that Sergeant Troy's supposed father was a doctor, but people said his real father was a nobleman. He had been brought up in Weatherbury, and was well known as a young soldier with a great interest in girls. Bathsheba could not remain angry for long with someone who admired her as much as he obviously did. It was unfortunate that Boldwood, when courting her, had forgotten to tell her, even once, that she was beautiful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她迅速把裙子从马刺上拉开，沿着路跑回了屋里。第二天，芭丝谢芭从利蒂那里得知托伊中士所谓的父亲是一个医生，人们说他真正的父亲是个贵族。他在威瑟伯里长大，人人都知道他是个对女孩子有极大兴趣的年轻士兵。对于一个像他这样明显地赞赏自己的人，芭丝谢芭不会生他的气。多么遗憾，伯德伍德在追求她时，一次也没提起她长得漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sergeant Troy was certainly an unusual man. He lived only in the present, caring nothing for the past or the future. Because he never expected anything, he was never disappointed. To men he usually told the truth, but to women, never. He was intelligent and well-educated, and proud of his success with women.</div>

<div class="line_en">A week or two after the sheep-shearing, Bathsheba was in the hayfields, where her workers were cutting the hay.
