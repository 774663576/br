<div class="line_en">These people began to smile a curious smile at him, a smile he had never seen before: the sheepish smile of secret conspiratorial consent. It was the smile of two men meeting accidentally in a brothel: both slightly abashed, they are at the same time glad that the feeling is mutual, and a bond of something akin to brotherhood develops between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些人朝托马斯投来他以前从未遇到过的古怪的微笑：那是一种秘密同谋之间不好意思的笑。就好像两个男人碰巧在妓院相遇，微微一笑，双方都有点难为情，但同时也暗暗感到一丝快慰，因为这种不好意思是双方的。于是在他们之间就建立起了一种友好的关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas was considered the best surgeon in the hospital. Rumor had it that the chief surgeon, who was getting on towards retirement age, would soon ask him to take over. When that rumor was supplemented by the rumor that the authorities had requested a statement of self-criticism from him, no one doubted he would comply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯是医院公认的最好的外科医生。私下有人已经传言，主任已经快到退休年龄，他不久就会把位置让给托马斯。所以当有传闻说当局要求他写份自我批评的声明时，谁都不怀疑他会从命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the first thing that struck him: although he had never given people cause to doubt his integrity, they were ready to bet on his dishonesty rather than on his virtue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让托马斯吃惊的，首先是他虽然从没做什么事让人有理由这样看他，但谁都打赌，说他肯定会缺德，而不是正直为人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second thing that struck him was their reaction to the position they attributed to him. I might divide it into two basic types: The first type of reaction came from people who themselves (they or their intimates) had retracted something, who had themselves been forced to make public peace with the occupation regime or were prepared to do so (unwillingly, of course -- no one wanted to do it).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外令他吃惊的，是人们认为他会缺德之后对他的反应。总的说来，我可以把他们的这种反应分成两类：第一类反应出自于（本人或者亲朋）曾经收回过什么东西的人（本人或亲朋），他们曾经被迫公开表示支持占领当局，或者准备这么做（当然是违心的，谁也不会打心底里乐意做这种事）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second type of reaction came from people who themselves (they or their intimates) had been persecuted, who had refused to compromise with the occupation powers or were convinced they would refuse to compromise (to sign a statement) even though no one had requested it of them (for instance, because they were too young to be seriously involved).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二类反应来自受到过迫害的那些人（本人或者亲朋），他们曾经拒绝向占领当局做任何妥协，或者虽然还没有人要求他们妥协或是发表声明（比如也许因为他们还太年轻，没有任何危险举动），但他们信念坚定，即使发生这样的事，也决不会让步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the latter, Doctor S., a talented young physician, asked Tomas one day, Well, have you written it up for them?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="S大夫就是后一类中的一员，他年轻且天赋极高。一天，他问托马斯：“喂，你给他们写那玩意儿了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their smiles were all the more complacent because he had never had the reputation of being a conformist. His supposed acceptance of the chief surgeon's proposal was therefore further proof that cowardice was slowly but surely becoming the norm of behavior and would soon cease being taken for what it actually was. He had never been friends with these people, and he realized with dismay that if he did in fact make the statement the chief surgeon had requested of him, they would start inviting him to parties and he would have to make friends with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又因为托马斯从来不被认为是个因循守旧的人，所以他们就更乐意对他笑。人们以为托马斯定会接受主任的恩赐，这种猜测于是又成了一个证据，证明懦弱将慢慢地、必然地成为其行为准则，且懦弱的含义也将不再同于从前。这些人从来就不是托马斯的朋友。他心里明白，也很恐惧，一旦按要求真的发表了声明，这些人就会邀请他去他们家做客，并想方设法，从此频繁往来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tell me, what do you know about my retraction? said Tomas. Have you read it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可听好了，”托马斯回答，“关于我的声明，你都知道什么？你读过了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why, your retraction, he said. There was no malice in his voice. He even smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“反悔的声明呀。”S答道。他的语气中没有恶意，甚至还面带微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One more smile from that thick herbal of smiles: the smile of smug moral superiority.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在托马斯所遇到的形形色色的微笑中，他的这一个是十分特别的：微笑中带着洋洋得意的精神优越感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What in the world are you talking about? Tomas asked in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抱歉，你想说的是什么？”托马斯回问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, said S.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”S答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then what are you babbling about?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你还乱说些什么。”托马斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas shrugged his shoulders and let S. go on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯耸耸肩，等着他继续往下说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still smug, still smiling, S. replied, Look, we know how it goes. You incorporate it into a letter to the chief surgeon or to some minister or somebody, and he promises it won't leak out and humiliate the author. Isn't that right?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="S还是带着他那洋洋得意的微笑说：“哎哟，谁都知道事情是怎么发生的。这种声明通常都以信的形式写给局长、部长或是别的什么人，他们承诺不将信的内容公开，以免声明者感到羞辱。是这样吧，对吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even after the statement is safely filed away, the author knows that it can be made public at any moment. So from then on he doesn't open his mouth, never criticizes a thing, never makes the slightest protest. The first peep out of him and into print it goes, sullying his good name far and wide. On the whole, it's rather a nice method. One could imagine worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“接着，这份声明会被小心地归档，不过声明者很清楚它随时可能公开登出。在这种情况下，他就再也不能说什么，再也不能去批判、去抗议什么了，否则声明被公开，他的名誉也就毁了。不过话说回来，这种手段还算是客气的。还有更糟糕的呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, it's a very nice method, said Tomas, but would you mind telling me who gave you the idea I'd agreed to go along with it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，这是很客气的手段，”托马斯说，“我倒是很好奇，想知道谁跟你说我写了的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And suddenly Tomas grasped a strange fact: everyone was smiling at him, everyone wanted him to write the retraction; it would make everyone happy! The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people with the second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯明白了一件不可思议的事情。所有人都对他微笑，所有人都希望他写反悔声明，而他一旦写了，就会让所有人都乐意！第一种人高兴，是因为一旦懦弱成风，他们曾经有过的行为便再也普通不过，因此也就给他们挽回了名誉。第二种人则把自己的荣耀看作一种特权，决不愿放弃。为此，他们对懦弱者心存一份喜爱，要是没有这些懦弱者，他们的勇敢将会立即变成一种徒劳之举，谁也不欣赏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">S. shrugged his shoulders, but the smile did not disappear from his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位同事耸耸肩，脸上仍挂着那微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas could not bear the smiles. He thought he saw them everywhere, even on the faces of strangers in the street. He began losing sleep. Could it be? Did he really hold those people in such high esteem? No. He had nothing good to say about them and was angry with himself for letting their glances upset him so. It was completely illogical. How could someone who had so little respect for people be so dependent on what they thought of him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯简直不能再忍受这些笑脸，觉得到处都是，甚至觉得连街头的陌生人的脸上也都挂着同样的笑容。他开始睡不着。什么？他竟然会如此在乎这帮人？才不是呢。他可不在乎他们，而是自己居然因为那些人的看法而不得安宁。这太不合逻辑了。像他这样的人，对别人的看法向来都不当一回事，怎么会被别人的说三道四牵制到这种份上？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps his deepseated mistrust of people (his doubts as to their right to decide his destiny and to judge him) had played its part in his choice of profession, a profession that excluded him from public display. A man who chooses to be a politician, say, voluntarily makes the public his judge, with the naive assurance that he will gain its favor. And if the crowd does express its disapproval, it merely goads him on to bigger and better things, much in the way Tomas was spurred on by the difficulty of a diagnosis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对他人的不信任，在托马斯身上是根深蒂固的（他总怀疑别人怎么可能有权利决定他的命运、有权对他说三道四），这在当初选择职业时也许就已经起了作用，它对在公众面前抛头露面的职业是排斥的。一个人一旦选择投身政界，必然十分乐意把公众视作自己的判官，并一相情愿而又天真地认为可以以此获得人心。而民众要是抱有敌对情绪，那反而会刺激他们更加投入，要求自己做得更好。托马斯也一样，疑难杂症，常给他类似的刺激。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A doctor (unlike a politician or an actor) is judged only by his patients and immediate colleagues, that is, behind closed doors, man to man. Confronted by the looks of those who judge him, he can respond at once with his own look, to explain or defend himself. Now (for the first time in his life) Tomas found himself in a situation where the looks fixed on him were so numerous that he was unable to register them. He could answer them neither with his own look nor with words. He was at everyone's mercy. People talked about him inside and outside the hospital (it was a time when news about who betrayed, who denounced, and who collaborated spread through nervous Prague with the uncanny speed of a bush telegraph); although he knew about it, he could do nothing to stop it. He was surprised at how unbearable he found it, how panic-stricken it made him feel.</div>
