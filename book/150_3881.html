<div class="line_cn" title="“是瓦尔特。”她嘴唇颤抖着小声说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pointed to his shoes. He tried to put them on, but his nervousness, for her alarm was affecting him, made him clumsy, and besides, they were on the tight side. With a faint gasp of impatience she gave him a shoe horn. She slipped into a kimono and in her bare feet went over to her dressing-table. Her hair was shingled and with a comb she had repaired its disorder before he had laced his second shoe. She handed him his coat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她用手指了指他的鞋。他便去穿鞋，但他的神经多少也有点紧张，因而显得笨手笨脚，而鞋带偏偏又是系着的。她不耐烦地叹了口气，上来把鞋给他生套上去。她一声不响地披上袍子，光着脚走到梳妆台前。她的头发已经结成一团了，她拿起梳子梳起头来。等她梳好了，他的第二只鞋才刚刚穿好。她把大衣递给他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It can't possibly be Walter. He doesn't leave the laboratory till five."</div>

<div class="line_en">They spoke in whispers now. She was quaking. It occurred to him that in an emergency she would lose her head and on a sudden he felt angry with her. If it wasn't safe why the devil had she said it was? She caught her breath and put her hand on his arm. He followed the direction of her glance. They stood facing the windows that led out on the verandah. They were shuttered and the shutters were bolted. They saw the white china knob of the handle slowly turn. They had heard no one walk along the verandah. It was terrifying to see that silent motion. A minute passed and there was no sound. Then, with the ghastliness of the supernatural, in the same stealthy, noiseless, and horrifying manner, they saw the white china knob of the handle at the other window turn also. It was so frightening that Kitty, her nerves failing her, opened her mouth to scream; but, seeing what she was going to do, he swiftly put his hand over it and her cry was smothered in his fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他们几乎是在窃窃私语。她不停颤抖着。他忽然觉得如果再有点事儿她就会疯了。他又怪起她来，按现在的情形，哪儿像她说得那么安全？她屏住呼吸，拉住了他的胳膊。他按她施的眼色望去。面前是通往走廊的窗户，都安着百叶窗，百叶窗是关好的。然而，窗子把手上的白色陶瓷旋钮却在慢慢地转动。他们没听见有人走过走廊。现在旋钮竟然不声不响地转了，简直把他们吓了一大跳。一分钟过去了，没有任何动静。接着，另一扇窗户的白色陶瓷旋钮也好像鬼使神差似的悄悄转了起来。凯蒂终于经受不住惊吓，张嘴就要尖叫。他赶紧捂住她的嘴，把叫声压了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Silence. She leaned against him, her knees shaking, and he was afraid she would faint. Frowning, his jaw set, he carried her to the bed and sat her down upon it. She was as white as the sheet and notwithstanding his tan his cheeks were pale too. He stood by her side looking with fascinated gaze at the china knob. They did not speak. Then he saw that she was crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里寂静下来。她斜倚在他身上，膝盖不停地颤抖。他担心她马上就会昏过去。他皱了一下眉头，咬了咬牙，把她抱到床上。她的脸像床单一样白。他的脸虽然是晒黑了，但这时也是白惨惨的。他站在她的身边，眼睛着魔似的盯着那个陶瓷旋钮。谁也没有说话。接着她还是哭了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For God's sake don't do that," he whispered irritably. "If we're in for it we're in for it. We shall just have to brazen it out."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I say, you must pull yourself together. It's a hundred to one it wasn't Walter. Why on earth should he come back at this hour? He never does come home in the middle of the day, does he?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听我说，你振作一点。我敢保证这人不是瓦尔特。他凭什么这个点儿回来？中午他从没回过家，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她摇了摇头。他皱了一下眉，心里渐渐烦躁起来，他也不知该如何是好。她突然把他的手抓紧了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他叫自己又微笑起来，恢复了轻柔体贴、循循善诱的声调，这种声调的效果自然毋庸置疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's not very likely. Have a little pluck, Kitty. How can it possibly be your husband? If he'd come in and seen a strange topee in the hall and come upstairs and found your room locked, surely he would have made some sort of row. It must have been one of the servants. Only a Chinese would turn a handle in that way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会的。提起精神来，凯蒂。好好想一想，不会是你丈夫的。要是他进来了，看见大厅有顶没见过的帽子，上楼来又发现你的房间上了锁，肯定要大喊大叫的。这一定是佣人搞的。除了中国人，没人上来就那样拧把手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did feel more herself now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她果然平静多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not very pleasant even if it was only the amah."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但即便是女佣人也不见得是好事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He must be right. She stood up and turning to him stretched out her arms: he took her in his and kissed her on the lips. It was such rapture that it was pain. She adored him. He released her and she went to the window. She slid back the bolt and opening the shutter a little looked out. There was not a soul. She slipped on to the verandah, looked into her husband's dressing-room and then into her own sitting-room. Both were empty. She went back to the bedroom and beckoned to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一定是对的。她站起身来，朝他伸出胳膊。他把她搂在怀里，吻了吻她的嘴唇。她心醉情迷，心里几乎痛苦起来。她崇拜他。他放开了她，她走到窗户前，拉开窗栓，把百叶窗微微扒开，向外瞧。一个影子也没有。她悄悄地走上走廊，向她丈夫的梳妆室里望，然后又瞅瞅自己的梳妆室，都是空的。她回到了卧室，向他挥了挥手。">查看中文翻译</div>
