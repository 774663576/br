<div class="line_en">A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto Ron's head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering, Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb dropped -- narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry's feet, sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw, floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Through the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain. Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent marble staircase.</div>

<div class="line_en">Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in midair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his head didn't wobble too much on his partially severed neck.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="分院仪式是把新生分到各个学院，在每个新学年开始的时候举行。可是哈利在自己被分进格兰芬多学院以后，由于许多偶然的因素，一直没有现场观看过分院仪式。他一直盼着能再经历一次。就在这时，一个兴奋得喘不过气来的声音从桌子那头传来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra's other side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape -- Harry's least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry's loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape's hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had helped Sirius escape right under Snape's overlarge nose -- Snape and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利更仔细地审视着教工桌子。教他们魔咒课的小矮个儿弗立维教授坐在一大堆软垫上，旁边是草药课老师斯普劳特教授，她的帽子斜戴在她飘拂的灰色长发上。她正在跟天文系的辛尼斯塔教授谈着什么。在辛尼斯塔教授的另一边，坐着灰黄脸、鹰钩鼻、头发油腻腻的魔药课老师——斯内普，他是哈利在霍格沃茨最不喜欢的人。哈利讨厌斯内普，斯内普也同样仇恨哈利，去年这种仇恨变得更加强烈了，因为哈利帮着小天狼星在斯内普硕大的鼻子底下逃跑了——而斯内普和小天狼星自学生时代起就是不共戴天的仇敌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next to it, and in the very center of the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons. The tips of Dumbledore's long, thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再那边就是桌子的正中间了，坐着校长邓布利多教授。他飘逸的银白色头发和胡须在烛光下闪闪发亮，华贵的深绿色长袍上绣着许多星星和月亮。邓布利多两只修长的手指尖碰在一起，他的下巴就放在指尖上面，眼睛透过半月形的镜片望着上面的天花板，好像陷入了沉思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry, Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school -- all of them except the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry recognized as Hagrid's moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for him that it looked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey's eye, gave a double thumbs-up, and mouthed, I fell in the lake!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他话音刚落，礼堂的门开了，大家立刻安静下来。麦格教授领着长长一排一年级新生走到礼堂顶端。如果说哈利、罗恩和赫敏浑身湿透的话，和这些一年级新生一比，就根本不算什么了。看他们的样子，就好像他们不是乘渡船，而是从湖里游过来的。他们顺着教工桌子站成一排，停住脚步，面对全校同学。他们因为又冷又紧张，一个个浑身发抖——只有最小的那个男孩子例外。他长着灰褐色的头发，身上裹着一件什么东西，哈利一眼认出那是海格的鼹鼠皮大衣。这件大衣穿在他身上太大了，他的样子就好像罩在一个黑色的马戏团毛皮帐篷下面。他的小脸从领子上面伸出来，神情激动得要命。当他和那些惊恐万状的同伴站成一排时，他的目光和科林·克里维相遇了。他翘起两个大拇指，用口型说道：“我掉进湖里了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="每隔一步，大厅里就回荡着一声沉闷的闷响。他走到最上面桌子的尽头，右转，一瘸一拐地向邓布利多走去。又一道闪电划过天花板。赫敏倒吸了一口冷气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lightning had thrown the man's face into sharp relief, and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of the nose was missing. But it was the man's eyes that made him frightening.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large, round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was moving ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye -- and then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man's head, so that all they could see was whiteness.</div>

This' -- Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious -- "is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hog-warts champion."
