<div class="line_en">"The Queen!" said the second gardener suddenly, and at once, the three gardeners lay down flat on their faces. Alice turned round and saw a great crowd of people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“王后！”第二个园丁突然说。三个园丁马上趴下，脸贴在地面上。爱丽丝转过身，看见一大群人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a pack of cards, walking through the garden. There were clubs (they were soldiers), and diamonds, and ten little children (they were hearts). Next came some Kings and Queens. Then Alice saw the White Rabbit, and behind him, the Knave of Hearts. And last of all, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一副牌，正在穿过花园。有方块（他们是士兵），梅花和十个小孩（他们是红桃）。随后是国王和王后们。这时，爱丽丝看见了白兔，他后面是红桃杰克，最后是红桃国王和王后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And who are these?" said the Queen, looking at the three gardeners. Then she saw the white roses, and her face turned red and angry.

<div class="line_en">It was the strangest game of croquet in Alice's life! The balls were hedgehogs, and the mallets were flamingoes. And the hoops were made by soldiers, who turned over and stood on their hands and feet. Alice held her flamingo's body under her arm, but the flamingo turned its long neck first this way and then that way. At last, Alice was ready to hit the ball with the flamingo's head. But by then, the hedgehog was tired of waiting and was walking away across the croquet-ground And when both the flamingo and the hedgehog were ready, there was no hoop! The soldiers too were always getting up and walking away. It really was a very difficult game, Alice thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是爱丽丝见过的最奇怪的槌球游戏！球是刺猬，木槌是红鹤。弓形小球门由士兵组成，他们转过身去，红鹤腿着地站着。爱丽丝用胳膊抱着红鹤的身体，但红鹤把脖子一会儿转到这边，一会儿转到那边。最后，爱丽丝准备好用红鹤的头去击球。可正在这时，刺猬等烦了，穿过槌球场走开了。当红鹤和刺猬都准备好时，却没有球门！士兵们也总是站起来走开。这场球可是太难打了，爱丽丝想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then she saw something very strange. She watched carefully, and after a minute or two she saw that the thing was a grin. "It's the Cheshire Cat," she said to herself. "Now I'll have somebody to talk to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时她看到一个很奇怪的东西。她仔细看，过了一会儿她看出来了，是一张咧着笑的嘴。“是切舍猫，”她心里想。“现在我可有人说话了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The players all played at the same time, and they were always arguing and fighting for hedgehogs. Nobody could agree about anything. Very soon, the Queen was wildly angry, and went around shouting "Off with his head!" or "Off with her head!" about once a minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打球的人总是同时打，老是争吵，争刺猬。在任何一件事上大家意见都不一致。很快王后气坏了，她走来走去，大约隔一分钟就大喊“砍掉他的脑袋”或者“砍掉她的脑袋”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice began to feel worried. "The Queen is sure to argue with me soon," she thought. "And what will happen to me then? They're cutting people's heads off all the time here. I'm surprised there is anyone left alive!"</div>
