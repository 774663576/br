<div class="line_en">That night he dreamt of wildlings howling from the woods, advancing to the moan of warhorns and the roll of drums. Boom DOOM boom DOOM boom DOOM came the sound, a thousand hearts with a single beat. Some had spears and some had bows and some had axes. Others rode on chariots made of bones, drawn by teams of dogs as big as ponies. Giants lumbered amongst them, forty feet tall, with mauls the size of oak trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. "Snow," an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. He slew a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she'd appeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="着火的箭杆嘶嘶地上窜，尾部拖着火舌。衣衫褴褛的守夜人翻滚着倒下，黑斗篷在燃烧。敌人们像蜘蛛一样爬上冰墙，这时一只鹰喊叫：“雪诺。”琼恩身穿黑色结冰的盔甲，但他手中的剑刃被火烧的通红。死人们不断地爬上长城，他把它们推下去再摔死一次。他杀死一个灰胡子和一个还没长胡子的男孩，一个巨人，一个龋齿的瘦男人，一个长着浓密红发的女孩。等他认出是耶歌蕊特时已经太晚了，她走了就像她的出现一样突然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The world dissolved into a red mist. Jon stabbed and slashed and cut. He hacked down Donal Noye and gutted Deaf Dick Follard. Qhorin Halfhand stumbled to his knees, trying in vain to staunch the flow of blood from his neck. "I am the Lord of Winterfell," Jon screamed. It was Robb before him now, his hair wet with melting snow. Longclaw took his head off. Then a gnarled hand seized Jon roughly by the shoulder. He whirled…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世界渐渐隐入红色的迷雾。琼恩突刺、劈砍、猛切，他砍倒了唐纳·诺伊和“聋子”迪克·佛拉德；“断掌”科林双膝跪倒在地，徒劳地想止住脖子上流出的鲜血。“我是临冬城公爵，”琼恩大叫。突然站在他面前的人变成了罗栢，他的头发被溶化的冰雪打湿了，“长爪”砍下了他的头。然后，一只粗糙的大手粗暴地抓住了他的肩膀，他开始旋转…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="…醒来时，乌鸦正在啄食他的胸膛。“雪诺，”鸟儿尖叫，琼恩挥开它。乌鸦尖声表示不满，拍打着翅膀飞上床柱，借着黎明前的暗光恶狠狠地盯着琼恩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day had come. It was the hour of the wolf. Soon enough the sun would rise, and four thousand wildlings would come pouring through the Wall. Madness. Jon Snow ran his burned hand through his hair and wondered once again what he was doing. Once the gate was opened there would be no turning back. It should have been the Old Bear to treat with Tormund. It should have been Jaremy Rykker or Qhorin Halfhand or Denys Mallister or some other seasoned man. It should have been my uncle. It was too late for such misgivings, though. Every choice had its risks, every choice its consequences. He would play the game to its conclusion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天已经亮了，现在是狼时。不久太阳就要升起，四千野人将会如潮水一般涌过长城。疯狂的举动。琼恩·雪诺用烧伤的手抓了抓头发，想再次确认自己在做些什么。一旦城门打开，事情将无法挽回。应该是熊老去跟托蒙德谈判，应该是杰里米·莱克（Jaremy Rykker），或者“断掌”科林，或者丹尼斯·梅利斯特，或者其他某个经验丰富的人。应该是我的叔叔。然而，这些疑虑都太迟了。任何选择都有其风险，任何选择都有其结果。他会把这条路走到底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And if not, it may turn to blood and carnage. "Remember," Jon said, "Tormund's people are hungry, cold, and fearful. Some of them hate us as much as some of you hate them. We are dancing on rotten ice here, them and us. One crack, and we all drown. If blood should be shed today, it had best not be one of us who strikes the first blow, or I swear by the old gods and the new that I will have the head of the man who strikes it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果野人不遵守呢，将演变成流血和屠杀。“记住，”琼恩说道，“托蒙德的人又冷又饿，还担惊受怕。如同我们有些人仇恨他们，他们有些人同样仇恨我们。大家正行走在钢丝上，包括他们和我们。稍有不慎，我们都将跌入万劫不复。如果今天出现流血，最好不要是我们中的某人射出第一支箭，否则，我以旧神和新神的名义发誓：我将砍下第一个射箭那人的脑袋。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont's raven muttered across the room. "Corn," the bird said, and, "King," and, "Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow." That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他起身在黑暗中穿上衣服，房间中回荡着莫尔蒙的乌鸦的喃喃抱怨。“玉米，”乌鸦说道，“国王，雪诺，琼恩—雪诺，琼恩—雪诺。”这很奇怪。据琼恩回忆，以前乌鸦从来没说过他的全名。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They answered him with ayes and nods and muttered words, with "As you command," and "It will be done," and "Yes, my lord." And one by one they rose and buckled on their swords and donned their warm black cloaks and strode out into the cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">His tail was waiting too. Jon had never liked surrounding himself with guards, but today it seemed prudent to keep a few good men beside him. They made a grim display in their ringmail, iron halfhelms, and black cloaks, with tall spears in their hands and swords and daggers on their belts. For this Jon had passed over all the green boys and greybeards in his command, choosing eight men in their prime: Ty and Mully, Left Hand Lew, Big Liddle, Rory, Fulk the Flea, Garrett Greenspear. And Leathers, Castle Black's new master-at-arms, to show the free folk that even a man who had fought for Mance in the battle beneath the Wall could find a place of honor in the Night's Watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的尾巴”也在等着他。琼恩从来都不喜欢守卫们包围着自己，但今天让几个好手站在身旁似乎是明智之举。他们包裹在一身冷酷的装备里：链甲、铁半盔、黑斗篷，手里握着长矛，腰上别着剑和匕首。为此，琼恩没考虑自己手下的任何一个绿男孩和灰胡子，而是选择了八个壮年：泰和穆利，‘左手’卢，大里德尔，罗里（Rory），‘跳蚤’福尔克（Fulk the Flea），‘绿矛’加列特（Garrett Greenspear），还有莱瑟斯（Leathers），黑城堡的新任教头，选他是为了给自由民宣示：即使是曾经为曼斯攻打长城战斗过的人，都能在守夜人军团里获得荣誉的高位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They parted there, Tollett for the east road, where his wagons waited, Jon Snow for the stables. Satin had his horse saddled and bridled and waiting for him, a fiery grey courser with a mane as black and shiny as maester's ink. He was not the sort of mount that Jon would have chosen for a ranging, but on this morning all that mattered was that he look impressive, and for that the stallion was a perfect choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在那儿分开，托勒特往东路走，他的马车在那儿等着，琼恩·雪诺走向马厩。萨丁已经为他的坐骑配好马鞍和缰绳等着他到来，一匹灰毛烈马，鬃毛又黑又亮像是学士的墨水。如果是出去巡逻，琼恩不会选择它作为坐骑。但今天早上最重要的是看起来有司令的派头，为此这匹公马才是最佳选择。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A deep red blush had appeared in the east by the time they all assembled at the gate. The stars are going out, Jon thought. When next they reappeared, they would be shining down upon a world forever changed. A few queen's men stood watching from beside the embers of Lady Melisandre's nightfire. When Jon glanced at the King's Tower, he glimpsed a flash of red behind a window. Of Queen Selyse he saw no sign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当一抹深红的光晕出现在东方天际，他们所有人都已经聚集到城门前。群星正在隐去，琼恩想，等它们再次出现，将会照耀一个永远改变的世界。几个后党人站在梅丽珊卓女士的夜火余烬旁观望。琼恩瞥了一眼国王塔，他瞥到窗户后面有一道红光。没有迹象表明是赛丽丝皇后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On either end of the long tunnel, gates swung open and iron bars unlocked. Dawn light shimmered on the ice above, pink and gold and purple. Dolorous Edd had not been wrong. The Wall would soon be weeping. Gods grant it weeps alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hostages went first -- one hundred boys between the ages of eight and sixteen. "Your blood price, Lord Crow," Tormund declared. "I hope the wailing o' their poor mothers don't haunt your dreams at night." Some of the boys were led to the gate by a mother or a father, others by older siblings. More came alone.

<div class="line_en">Two stewards counted the boys as they went by, noting each name on long sheepskin scrolls. A third collected their valuables for the toll and wrote that down as well. The boys were going to a place that none had ever been before, to serve an order that had been the enemy of their kith and kin for thousands of years, yet Jon saw no tears, heard no wailing mothers. These are winter's people, he reminded himself. Tears freeze upon your cheeks where they come from. Not a single hostage balked or tried to slink away when his turn came to enter that gloomy tunnel.</div>

Elsewise they came in every shape and size and color. He saw tall boys and short boys, brown-haired boys and black-haired boys, honey blonds and strawberry blonds and redheads kissed by fire, like Ygritte. He saw boys with scars, boys with limps, boys with pockmarked faces. Many of the older boys had downy cheeks or wispy little mustachios, but there was one fellow with a beard as thick as Tormund's. Some dressed in fine soft furs, some in boiled leather and oddments of armor, more in wool and seal-skins, a few in rags. One was naked. Many had weapons: sharpened spears, stone-headed mauls, knives made of bone or stone or dragonglass, spiked clubs, tanglenets, even here and there a rust-eaten old sword. The Hornfoot boys walked blithe and barefoot through the snowdrifts. Other lads had bear-paws on their boots and walked on top of the same drifts, never sinking through the crust. Six boys arrived on horses, two on mules. A pair of brothers turned up with a goat. The biggest hostage was six-and-a-half feet tall but had a baby's face; the smallest was a runty boy who claimed nine years but looked no more than six.</div>

The passage of the free folk had turned the ground to mud and muck: wooden wheels and horses' hooves, runners of bone and horn and iron, pig trotters, heavy boots, the cloven feet of cows and bullocks, the bare black feet of the Hornfoot folk, all had left their marks.

Strange voices echoed down the yards, and free folk were coming and going along icy paths that had only known the black boots of crows for years.
