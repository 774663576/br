<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有个可爱的小姑娘，谁见了都喜欢，但最喜欢她的是她的奶奶，简直是她要什么就给她什么。一次，奶奶送给小姑娘一顶用丝绒做的小红帽，戴在她的头上正好合适。从此，姑娘再也不愿意戴任何别的帽子，于是大家便叫她“小红帽”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day her mother said to her, "Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your grandmother. And when you enter her parlor, don't forget to say 'Good morning,' and don't peer into all the corners first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，妈妈对小红帽说：“来，小红帽，这里有一块蛋糕和一瓶葡萄酒，快给奶奶送去，奶奶生病了，身子很虚弱，吃了这些就会好一些的。趁着现在天还没有热，赶紧动身吧。在路上要好好走，不要跑，也不要离开大路，否则你会摔跤的，那样奶奶就什么也吃不上了。到奶奶家的时候，别忘了说‘早上好’，也不要一进屋就东瞧西瞅。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him.</div>

Anyway, it is still early, and I'll be home on time." And she ran off the path into the woods looking for flowers. Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was about to aim his rifle when it occurred to him that the wolf might have eaten the grandmother, and that she still might be rescued. So instead of shooting, he took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the wolf's belly.

<div class="line_en">And then the grandmother came out as well, alive but hardly able to breathe. Then Little Red Cap fetched some large stones. She filled the wolf's body with them, and when he woke up and tried to run away, the stones were so heavy that he immediately fell down dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">They remained silent, and did not open the door. Gray-Head crept around the house several times, and finally jumped onto the roof. He wanted to wait until Little Red Cap went home that evening, then follow her and eat her up in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what he was up to. There was a large stone trough in front of the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她们既不说话，也不开门。这长着灰毛的家伙围着房子转了两三圈，最后跳上屋顶，打算等小红帽在傍晚回家时偷偷跟在她的后面，趁天黑把她吃掉。可奶奶看穿了这家伙的坏心思。她想起屋子前有一个大石头槽子，便对小姑娘说：“小红帽，把桶拿来。我昨天做了一些香肠，提些煮香肠的水去倒进石头槽里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fetch a bucket, Little Red Cap," she said to the child. "Yesterday I cooked some sausage. Carry the water that I boiled them with to the trough." Little Red Cap carried water until the large, large trough was clear full. The smell of sausage arose into the wolf's nose. He sniffed and looked down, stretching his neck so long that he could no longer hold himself, and he began to slide. He slid off the roof, fell into the trough, and drowned. And Little Red Cap returned home happily, and no one harmed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小红帽提了很多很多水，把那个大石头槽子装得满满的。香肠的气味飘进了狼的鼻孔，它使劲地用鼻子闻呀闻，并且朝下张望着，到最后把脖子伸得太长了，身子开始往下滑。它从屋顶上滑了下来，正好落在大石槽中，淹死了。小红帽高高兴兴地回了家，从此再也没有谁伤害过她。">查看中文翻译</div>
