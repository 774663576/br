<div class="line_en">Black Balaq commanded one thousand bows. In his youth, Jon Connington had shared the disdain most knights had for bowmen, but he had grown wiser in exile. In its own way, the arrow was as deadly as the sword, so for the long voyage he had insisted that Homeless Harry Strickland break Balaq's command into ten companies of one hundred men and place each company upon a different ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑巴曲麾下有一千名弓箭手。年轻时，琼恩·克林顿和大多数骑士一样鄙视弓箭手，但他在流亡生涯中汲取了更多智慧。弓箭若运用得当，跟长剑一样厉害。漫长的航程中，他坚持要求无家可归的哈利·斯崔克兰将巴曲的部队平分为十队、每队一百人，各乘一艘船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Six of those ships had stayed together well enough to deliver their passengers to the shores of Cape Wrath (the other four were lagging but would turn up eventually, the Volantenes assured them, but Griff thought it just as likely they were lost or had landed elsewhere), which left the company with six hundred bows. For this, two hundred proved sufficient. "They will try to send out ravens," he told Black Balaq. "Watch the maester's tower. Here." He pointed to the map he had drawn in the mud of their campsite. "Bring down every bird that leaves the castle."</div>

<div class="line_en">The castle rose from the shores of Cape Wrath, on a lofty crag of dark red stone surrounded on three sides by the surging waters of Shipbreaker Bay. Its only approach was defended by a gatehouse, behind which lay the long bare ridge the Conningtons called the griffin's throat. To force the throat could be a bloody business, since the ridge exposed the attackers to the spears, stones, and arrows of defenders in the two round towers that flanked the castle's main gates. And once they reached those gates, the men inside could pour down boiling oil on their heads. Griff expected to lose a hundred men, perhaps more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城堡耸立于风怒角岸边一座高一耸的暗一红石山上，三面为破船湾的汹涌波涛环绕，进城的唯一途径被一座门楼保卫着，门楼后是光秃秃的长山脊——克林顿称其为“狮鹫之喉”。强行突破“狮鹫之喉”势必付出惨重代价，因为进攻者将暴露在城堡大门两侧圆形塔楼中的防御者眼皮下，受到长矛、石头和弓箭的袭击。等冲到门口，守城的还可倒下沸油。综合考虑，格里芬预计得损失一百名士兵，甚至更多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A third of Balaq's men used crossbows, another third the double-curved horn-and-sinew bows of the east. Better than these were the big yew long-bows borne by the archers of Westerosi blood, and best of all were the great bows of goldenheart treasured by Black Balaq himself and his fifty Summer Islanders. Only a dragonbone bow could outrange one made of goldenheart. Whatever bow they carried, all of Balaq's men were sharp-eyed, seasoned veterans who had proved their worth in a hundred battles, raids, and skirmishes. They proved it again at Griffin's Roost.</div>

<div class="line_en">The woods had been allowed to encroach on the field beyond the gatehouse, so Franklyn Flowers was able to use the brush for concealment and lead his men within twenty yards of the gates before emerging from the trees with the ram they'd fashioned back at camp. The crash of wood on wood brought two men to the battlements; Black Balaq's archers took down both of them before they could rub the sleep out of their eyes. The gate turned out to be closed but not barred; it gave way at the second blow, and Ser Franklyn's men were halfway up the throat before a warhorn sounded the alarum from the castle proper.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first raven took flight as their grapnels were arcing above the curtain wall, the second a few moments later. Neither bird had flown a hundred yards before an arrow took it down. A guard inside dumped down a bucket of oil on the first men to reach the gates, but as he'd had no time to heat it, the bucket caused more damage than its contents. Swords were soon ringing in half a dozen places along the battlements. The men of the Golden Company clambered through the merlons and raced along the wallwalks, shouting "A griffin! A griffin!," the ancient battle cry of House Connington, which must have left the defenders even more confused.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was over within minutes. Griff rode up the throat on a white courser beside Homeless Harry Strickland. As they neared the castle, he saw a third raven flap from the maester's tower, only to be feathered by Black Balaq himself. "No more messages," he told Ser Franklyn Flowers in the yard. The next thing to come flying from the maester's tower was the maester. The way his arms were flapping, he might have been mistaken for another bird.</div>

We want to win the stormlands, and we won't do that with slaughter. Be sure you look under the altar of the Mother, there's a hidden stair there that leads down to a secret bolt-hole.

<div class="line_en">Yet when they parted, Jon Connington did not go to the sept. Instead his steps led him up to the roof of the east tower, the tallest at Griffin's Roost. As he climbed he remembered past ascents -- a hundred with his lord father, who liked to stand and look out over woods and crags and sea and know that all he saw belonged to House Connington, and one (only one!) with Rhaegar Targaryen. Prince Rhaegar was returning from Dorne, and he and his escort had lingered here a fortnight. He was so young then, and I was younger. Boys, the both of us. At the welcoming feast, the prince had taken up his silver-stringed harp and played for them. A song of love and doom, Jon Connington recalled, and every woman in the hall was weeping when he put down the harp. Not the men, of course. Particularly not his own father, whose only love was land. Lord Armond Connington spent the entire evening trying to win the prince to his side in his dispute with Lord Morrigen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="分别后，琼恩·克林顿却没急着去圣堂，而是登上东塔，塔顶是鹫巢堡的制高点。他一边爬，往事一边浮上心头——他曾上百次跟父亲大人爬这段楼梯，父亲喜欢站在塔顶自豪地瞭望四周的森林、石山和大海，极目所见全是克林顿家族的封地；还有一次（就一次！），他陪伴雷加·坦格利安登塔。当年雷加刚从多恩回来，他和他的护卫在此盘桓了两星期。当年的我和当年的他，我们好年轻，我们还是孩子。欢迎宴会上，王子拿起银弦竖琴为大家演唱。那是一首一爱一与毁灭的歌，琼恩·克林顿思慕地想，他放下竖琴时，厅里每个女人都在哭泣。男人们当然没哭。尤其是他父亲，他父亲一爱一的只有领地。整晚，亚蒙德·克林顿伯爵都在游说王子，想要王子在他与莫里根伯爵的争端中支持他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door to the roof of the tower was stuck so fast that it was plain no one had opened it in years. He had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. But when Jon Connington stepped out onto the high battlements, the view was just as intoxicating as he remembered: the crag with its wind-carved rocks and jagged spires, the sea below growling and worrying at the foot of the castle like some restless beast, endless leagues of sky and cloud, the wood with its autumnal colors. "Your father's lands are beautiful," Prince Rhaegar had said, standing right where Jon was standing now. And the boy he'd been had replied, "One day they will all be mine." As if that could impress a prince who was heir to the entire realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔顶的门卡得死死的，显然多年没人来过，他不得不用肩使劲撞开。琼恩·克林顿走到那高一耸的城垛背后，发现眼前美景跟记忆中并无二致：风蚀岩石和锯齿状的尖石山，如不倦的咆哮野兽般冲击着城堡根基的大海，无尽的长天和云朵，秋意盎然的森林。“你父亲的领地真美，”雷加王子站在琼恩现在的位置说。还是个孩子的他回答：“总有一天它们是我的。”好像这能给注定君临七大王国、统治从青亭岛到长城的辽阔疆土的王子留下什么印象。">查看中文翻译</div>

Robert Baratheon had completed the destruction of the griffins after the war. Cousin Ronald was permitted to retain his castle and his head, but he lost his lordship, thereafter being merely the Knight of Griffin's Roost, and nine-tenths of his lands were taken from him and parceled out to neighbor lords who had supported Robert's claim.</div>

He had even sent men crawling through the sewers, yet somehow Robert still eluded him. The townsfolk were hiding him. They moved him from one secret bolt-hole to the next, always one step ahead of the king's men. The whole town was a nest of traitors. At the end they had the usurper hidden in a brothel. What sort of king was that, who would hide behind the skirts of women? Yet whilst the search dragged on, Eddard Stark and Hoster Tully came down upon the town with a rebel army. Bells and battle followed, and Robert emerged from his brothel with a blade in hand, and almost slew Jon on the steps of the old sept that gave the town its name.</div>

Men and boys, babes at the breast, noble knights and holy septons, pigs and whores, rats and rebels, he would have burned them all. When the fires guttered out and only ash and cinders remained, he would have sent his men in to find the bones of Robert Baratheon. Later, when Stark and Tully turned up with their host, he would have offered pardons to the both of them, and they would have accepted and turned for home with their tails between their legs."</div>

Amongst the prisoners were Ronnet's younger brother Raymund, his sister Alynne, and his natural son, a fierce red-haired boy they called Ronald Storm. All would make for useful hostages if and when Red Ronnet should return to try and take back the castle that his father had stolen. Connington ordered them confined to the west tower, under guard. The girl began to cry at that, and the bastard boy tried to bite the spearman closest to him. "Stop it, the both of you," he snapped at them.

Even before they had sailed from Volon Therys, he had instructed his captains to show no banners during these first attacks -- not Prince Aegon's three-headed dragon, nor his own griffins, nor the skulls and golden battle standards of the company. Let the Lannisters suspect Stannis Baratheon, pirates from the Stepstones, outlaws out of the woods, or whoever else they cared to blame. If the reports that reached King's Landing were confused and contradictory, so much the better. The slower the Iron Throne was to react, the longer they would have to gather their strength and bring allies to the cause. There should be ships on Estermont. It is an island. Haldon, send word to Mandrake to leave a garrison behind and bring the rest of his men over to Cape Wrath, along with any noble captives."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not yet. Let King's Landing think this is no more than an exile lord coming home with some hired swords to reclaim his birthright. An old familiar story, that. I will even write King Tommen, stating as much and asking for a pardon and the restoration of my lands and titles. That will give them something to chew over for a while. And whilst they dither, we will send out word secretly to likely friends in the stormlands and the Reach. And Dorne." That was the crucial step.
