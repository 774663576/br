<div class="line_en">Her happiness, sometimes almost more than she could bear, renewed her beauty. Just before she married, beginning to lose her first freshness, she had looked tired and drawn. The uncharitable said that she was going off. But there is all the difference between a girl of twenty-five and a married woman of that age. She was like a rosebud that is beginning to turn yellow at the edges of the petals, and then suddenly she was a rose in full bloom. Her starry eyes gained a more significant expression; her skin (that feature which had always been her greatest pride and most anxious care) was dazzling: it could not be compared to the peach or to the flower; it was they that demanded comparison with it. She looked eighteen once more. She was at the height of her glowing loveliness. It was impossible not to remark it and her women friends asked her in little friendly asides if she was going to have a baby. The indifferent who had said she was just a very pretty woman with a long nose admitted that they had misjudged her. She was what Charlie had called her the first time he saw her, a raging beauty.</div>

<div class="line_en">She worshipped him. He was splendid, in his smart top boots and his white breeches, when he played polo. In tennis clothes he looked a mere boy. Of course he was proud of his figure: it was the best figure she had ever seen. He took pains to keep it. He never ate bread or potatoes or butter. And he took a great deal of exercise. She liked the care he took of his hands; he was manicured once a week. He was a wonderful athlete and the year before he had won the local tennis championship. Certainly he was the best dancer she had ever danced with; it was a dream to dance with him. No one would think he was forty. She told him she did not believe it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她崇拜他。他打马球时身穿白色马裤，脚登漂亮的长筒靴，样子像个明星。身着网球服时他纯粹就是个年轻小伙儿。他的身材是她见过的最棒的，他引以为荣当然无可厚非。要知道为了保持体形他吃尽了苦头。他从不碰面包、土豆还有黄油，平时没少做锻炼。他对手指爱护有加，每个礼拜修剪一次指甲，令她颇为欣赏。他是位杰出的运动健将，前年方才得了地方网球冠军。他恐怕是她有幸遇到的最棒的舞者，跟他跳舞如坠梦境。没人会看出他有四十岁了。她对他说连她也不信他的年龄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They managed their intrigue with skill. He had a broad back, he told her ("I will not have you swank about your figure," she interrupted lightly), and it did not matter about him; but for her sake they mustn't take the smallest risk. They could not meet often alone, not half often enough for him, but he had to think of her furst, sometimes in the curio shop, now and then after luncheon in her house when no one was about; but she saw him a good deal here and there. It amused her then to see the formal way he spoke to her, jovial, for he was always that, with the same manner he used with everyone. Who could imagine when they heard him chaff her with that charming humour of his that so lately he had held her in his passionate arms?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一次交往他们都需要小心地谋划。他对她说他身材高大宽阔，太过惹人注目（“我不准你瞎吹牛。”她轻声地打断他），不过这不要紧。但是为了她的缘故，他不想有任何闪失。他们单独相会的次数少得可怜，有时在古董店，有时午饭后趁着没人到她家里。这与他期望的相去甚远。她依然在很多正式场合见到他。他像对待任何人一样，以一贯热情的方式跟她攀谈。谁能想到现在他跟她插科打诨，不久之前他还把她搂在怀里呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was full of accomplishments. He could play the piano quite well, rag-time, of course, and he could sing a comic song with a rich voice and good humour. She did not believe there was anything he could not do: he was very clever at his work too and she shared his pleasure when he told her that the Governor had particularly congratulated him on the way he had done some difficult job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他才华横溢，弹了一手好钢琴，连拉格泰姆爵士风格也信手拈来。讽刺歌唱得也满像样，音色圆润，笑趣迭出。她想不出有什么是他做不来的。工作上他如鱼得水，他曾给她讲过有一回他帮政府解决了棘手难题，博得总督大人亲临祝贺。她和他分享着这个荣耀。">查看中文翻译</div>
