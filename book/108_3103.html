<div class="line_en">Ove presses the soles of his shoes into the snow. He had certainly not begun this day with the intention of letting either women or cats into his house, he'd like to make that very clear to her. But she comes right at him with the animal in her arms and determination in her steps. It's really only a question of the speed of his reactions whether she walks through him or past him. Ove has never experienced a worse woman when it comes to listening to what decent people tell her. He feels out of breath again. He fights the impulse to clutch his breast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维把鞋底在雪里踩得更深。他今天委实没有任何待客的意愿，不管是女人，还是猫，这他得跟她说清楚。但她捧着那个畜生迎面朝他冲了过来，脚步坚定，就像得由他自己的反应来决定她是从他身上还是身边走过去。欧维从没见过这么不听好人言的女人。他强忍着捂住胸口的冲动，感到呼吸又沉重起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She keeps going. He gives way. She strides past.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="下一秒帕尔瓦娜已经钻进了雪堆里，过了一会儿，她又钻了出来，单薄的胳膊上捧着那只冻僵的小妖孽。看上去就像四根冰棍和一块破围巾冻在了一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the way up and down the stairs he mumbles to himself about why it has to be so damned difficult to get any peace and quiet on this street.
