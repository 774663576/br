<div class="line_en">We landed in Philadelphia on the 11th of October, where I found sundry alterations. Keith was no longer governor, being superseded by Major Gordon. I met him walking the streets as a common citizen. He seem'd a little asham'd at seeing me, but pass'd without saying anything. I should have been as much asham'd at seeing Miss Read, had not her friends, despairing with reason of my return after the receipt of my letter, persuaded her to marry another, one Rogers, a potter, which was done in my absence. With him, however, she was never happy, and soon parted from him, refusing to cohabit with him or bear his name, it being now said that he bad another wife. He was a worthless fellow, tho' an excellent workman, which was the temptation to her friends. He got into debt, ran away in 1727 or 1728, went to the West Indies, and died there. Keimer had got a better house, a shop well supply'd with stationery, plenty of new types, a number of hands, tho' none good, and seem'd to have a great deal of business.</div>

<div class="line_en">We lodg'd and, boarded together; he counsell'd me as a father, having a sincere regard for me. I respected and lov'd him, and we might have gone on together very happy; but, in the beginning of February, 1726-7, when I had just pass'd my twenty-first year, we both were taken ill. My distemper was a pleurisy, which very nearly carried me off. I suffered a good deal, gave up the point in my own mind, and was rather disappointed when I found myself recovering, regretting, in some degree, that I must now, some time or other, have all that disagreeable work to do over again. I forget what his distemper was; it held him a long time, and at length carried him off. He left me a small legacy in a nuncupative will, as a token of his kindness for me, and he left me once more to the wide world; for the store was taken into the care of his executors, and my employment under him ended.</div>

<div class="line_en">My brother-in-law, Holmes, being now at Philadelphia, advised my return to my business; and Keimer tempted me, with an offer of large wages by the year, to come and take the management of his printing-house, that he might better attend his stationer's shop. I had heard a bad character of him in London from his wife and her friends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. I tri'd for farther employment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting with any, I clos'd again with Keimer. I found in his house these hands: Hugh Meredith, a Welsh Pensilvanian, thirty years of age, bred to country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid observation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. Stephen Potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. These he had agreed with at extream low wages per week, to be rais'd a shilling every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their business; and the expectation of these high wages, to come on hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. Meredith was to work at press, Potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach them, though he knew neither one nor t'other. John --, a wild Irishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four years, Keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was to be made a pressman. George Webb, an Oxford scholar, whose time for four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of whom more presently; and David Harry, a country boy, whom he had taken apprentice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我姐夫荷麦斯这时在费城，劝我重回本行。凯谋在劝诱我，他愿意给我高额的年薪，要我去管理他的印刷铺，使他可以更好地照料他的文具铺。在伦敦时从他的妻子和他妻子的朋友那里我听到他的名声很坏，所以我不愿意再和他发生关系。我设法想找一个商店店员的位置，但是一时找不到，所以我又答应了凯谋。在他的印刷铺里我找到了下面这些工人：休·梅莱笛斯是一个威尔斯籍的宾夕法尼亚人，三十岁，惯做庄稼活，诚实，懂事，有相当敏锐的观察力，也喜欢念一点书，但好酒；司蒂芬·博茨是一个年轻的成年庄稼汉，习农，天资颖悟，生性幽默，善谐谑，但是有点吊儿郎当。凯谋跟他们约定每周给他们极低廉的工资，随着他们技术的改进，每隔三个月他们的工资将增加一先令。这种未来的高额工资是他勾引他们来的一种手段。梅莱笛斯将做印刷工，博茨装订工。按照合同，他要教他们这两种技术，虽然他自己一样也不懂。一个叫约翰什么的是一个粗野的爱尔兰人，什么行业也没有学过，凯谋从一只船的船主那里买了他四年的服役，他也要他成为一个印刷工。乔治·卫勃是一个牛津大学的学生，凯谋也买了他四年的服役，打算叫他做一个排字工人，下面我还要讲到他。还有大卫·海利是一个乡下孩子，凯谋收他当学徒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was an odd thing to find an Oxford scholar in the situation of a bought servant. He was not more than eighteen years of age, and gave me this account of himself; that he was born in Gloucester, educated at a grammar-school there, had been distinguish'd among the scholars for some apparent superiority in performing his part, when they exhibited plays; belong'd to the Witty Club there, and had written some pieces in prose and verse, which were printed in the Gloucester newspapers; thence he was sent to Oxford; where he continued about a year, but not well satisfi'd, wishing of all things to see London, and become a player. At length, receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas, instead of discharging his debts he walk'd out of town, hid his gown in a furze bush, and footed it to London, where, having no friend to advise him, he fell into bad company, soon spent his guineas, found no means of being introduc'd among the players, grew necessitous, pawn'd his cloaths, and wanted bread. Walking the street very hungry, and not knowing what to do with himself, a crimp's bill was put into his hand, offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个牛津大学的学生成为一个卖身仆，是一件奇闻。他还不到十八岁，他告诉我这样一段他自己的历史，他生在葛劳斯特，曾在当地的语法学校读过书，当他们在学校里演戏时，他因为在表演时显出了显而易见的才能，所以在学生中很有名气，在学校里他参加了“幽默社”，也写过一些短篇的诗歌和散文，它们曾经在葛劳斯特的报纸上发表过。从那里他被送到了牛津。在大学里他继续读了一年书，但是他不很满意，他最希望的是到伦敦去观光和当演员。最后，当他领到三个月的补助金十五个金币时，他不去还清债务，却走出了市镇，把他的大学礼服藏在金雀花丛中，步行到了伦敦，在那里，因为没有亲友指导他，结识了坏人，不久就花完了他的金币，还找不到进入戏剧界的门路，贫穷了，当衣服，但又无钱买面包。当他空着肚子走在街上，而又不知道如何是好时，有人把一张人贩子的传单塞入他的手中，上面答应凡是愿意出卖自己到美洲去服役的人马上可以得到饮食和奖励。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I soon perceiv'd that the intention of engaging me at wages so much higher than he had been us'd to give, was, to have these raw, cheap hands form'd thro' me; and, as soon as I had instructed them, then they being all articled to him, he should be able to do without me. I went on, however, very cheerfully, put his printing-house in order, which had been in great confusion, and brought his hands by degrees to mind their business and to do it better.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went directly, sign'd the indentures, was put into the ship, and came over, never writing a line to acquaint his friends what was become of him. He was lively, witty, good-natur'd, and a pleasant companion, but idle, thoughtless, and imprudent to the last degree.</div>

<div class="line_en">John, the Irishman, soon ran away; with the rest I began to live very agreeably, for they all respected me the more, as they found Keimer incapable of instructing them, and that from me they learned something daily. We never worked on Saturday, that being Keimer's Sabbath, so I had two days for reading. My acquaintance with ingenious people in the town increased. Keimer himself treated me with great civility and apparent regard, and nothing now made me uneasy but my debt to Vernon, which I was yet unable to pay, being hitherto but a poor oeconomist. He, however, kindly made no demand of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个爱尔兰人约翰不久就逃跑了。我跟其余的人相处得很愉快，因为他们发现凯谋自己不能教他们技术，而从我这里他们每天学到一点东西，所以他们都更加尊敬我了。我们在礼拜六从不工作，因为那是凯谋的安息日，这样我就有两天可以读书了。我在城里认识了更多的有发明天才的人。凯谋自己待我十分殷勤，表面上很尊敬我，这时我心中别无挂虑，只是我欠佛南的债款，到这时我还无力偿还，因为我不善节约。但是，他很讲情义，不提起这笔债。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our printing-house often wanted sorts, and there was no letter-founder in America; I had seen types cast at James's in London, but without much attention to the manner; however, I now contrived a mould, made use of the letters we had as puncheons, struck the matrices in lead, And thus supply'd in a pretty tolerable way all eficiencies.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, however serviceable I might be, I found that my services became every day of less importance, as the other hands improv'd in the business; and, when Keimer paid my second quarter's wages, he let me know that he felt them too heavy, and thought I should make an abatement. He grew by degrees less civil, put on more of the master, frequently found fault, was captious, and seem'd ready for an outbreaking. I went on, nevertheless, with a good deal of patience, thinking that his encumber'd circumstances were partly the cause. At length a trifle snapt our connections; for, a great noise happening near the court-house, I put my head out of the window to see what was the matter. Keimer, being in the street, look'd up and saw me, call'd out to me in a loud voice and angry tone to mind my business, adding some reproachful words, that nettled me the more for their publicity, all the neighbors who were looking out on the same occasion being witnesses how I was treated. He came up immediately into the printing-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on both sides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing a wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning. I told him his wish was unnecessary, for I would leave him that instant; and so, taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring Meredith, whom I saw below, to take care of some things I left, and bring them to my lodgings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是不管多么有用，我发现当其他工人的业务逐渐改进时，我的帮助一天比一天地显得不重要了。当凯谋付了我第二季度的工资以后，他告诉我他觉得我的工资太高了，认为我应当减低一些。他逐渐地待我没有从前那么殷勤了，摆出了老板的面孔，常常吹毛求疵，无事生非，好像准备爆发的样子。但是，我仍然是继续工作，勉强忍耐，因为我想他向我生气的部分原因是因为他的经济情况欠佳。终于一件琐事却使我们的关系突然破裂了。有一次在法院附近发生了巨大的嘈杂声，我把头伸出窗外，看看究竟是什么事情。凯谋这时候在街上，抬头见了我，声色俱厉地向我叫喊，要我别管闲事，接着又加了一些责备的话。这时所有往外面看热闹的邻居都看到了他是如何地待我，正因为他当众责备我，这才更加激怒了我。他立即跑到印刷所楼上来，继续跟我争吵，于是双方破口怒骂，他按照合同给我三个月的解雇通知，但是他对于他必须给我这样长期的预告表示后悔。我告诉他他的懊悔是不需要的，因为我要立刻离开他了。这样，我就拿了我的帽子，走出了门，在楼下我看见了梅莱笛斯，我就要他照料我留下的一些东西，并把它们送到我的宿舍来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair over. He had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling that I should leave the house while he remain'd in it. He dissuaded me from returning to my native country, which I began to think of; he reminded me that Keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold often without profit for ready money, and often trusted without keeping accounts; that he must therefore fall, which would make a vacancy I might profit of. I objected my want of money. He then let me know that his father had a high opinion of me, and, from some discourse that had pass'd between them, he was sure would advance money to set us up, if I would enter into partnership with him. "My time," says he, "will be out with Keimer in the spring; by that time we may have our press and types in from London. I am sensible I am no workman; if you like it, your skill in the business shall be set against the stock I furnish, and we will share the profits equally."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，梅莱笛斯在晚间来了，这时候我们讨论了我的事件。他非常尊敬我，因此在我离开了那个印刷所以后，他也不愿意再留在那里了。我开始想到回到家乡去，但是他却劝阻我。他提醒我凯谋所欠的债和他的资产相等了，他的债主们开始感到不安了，他把他的铺子弄得乱七八糟，为了得到现金他往往做不赚钱的生意，而且常常赊卖货物，又不记账，因此他必然会倒闭，他一倒闭我就有可乘之隙。但是我说我没有钱，然后他说他的父亲很相信我，从他跟他父亲的一些谈话中，他相信假如我愿意跟他合伙的话，他父亲会投资帮我们自己开业的。他说：“我跟凯谋的合同将在明春满期，到了那时候我们将从伦敦买到了我们自己的印刷机和铅字。我知道我的技术很差，假如你愿意的话，你提供你的业务上的技术，我供给资本，我们平分赢利。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The proposal was agreeable, and I consented; his father was in town and approv'd of it; the more as he saw I had great influence with his son, had prevail'd on him to abstain long from dram-drinking, and he hop'd might break him off that wretched habit entirely, when we came to be so closely connected. I gave an inventory to the father, who carry'd it to a merchant; the things were sent for, the secret was to be kept till they should arrive, and in the mean time I was to get work, if I could, at the other printing-house. But I found no vacancy there, and so remain'd idle a few days, when Keimer, on a prospect of being employ'd to print some paper money in New Jersey, which would require cuts and various types that I only could supply, and apprehending Bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return. Meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for his improvement under my daily instructions; so I return'd, and we went on more smoothly than for some time before. The New jersey jobb was obtain'd, I contriv'd a copperplate press for it, the first that had been seen in the country; I cut several ornaments and checks for the bills. We went together to Burlington, where I executed the whole to satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be enabled thereby to keep his head much longer above water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个提议我欣然赞同了，他父亲这时候在城里，也同意了我们的计划，特别是因为他看到他的儿子很信任我。我已经劝他戒了一个时期的酒，他希望当我们两人那样紧密地结合在一起时，我或许能使他完全戒掉这恶劣的习惯。我开了一张清单给他的父亲，他父亲交给一个商人去订货了。在机器未运到之前我们要严守秘密，在其间，假如可能的话，我将设法在其他印刷铺找些工作。但是我找不到空缺，所以闲了几天。这时，凯谋因为希望获得新泽西印纸币的生意，需要只有我能做的雕板和各种铅字，同时因为怕勃拉福雇用了我把生意抢去，所以给我写了一封十分谦恭的信，说多年的老朋友不应当因为几句一时气愤的话就分手，希望我回去。梅莱笛斯劝我去，因为在我日常的指导之下他可以有更多的机会增进他的技术。这样，我就回去了，我们相处得比以前一段时间好多了，凯谋得到了新泽西的生意，我替它设计了一部铜板印刷机，这在美洲还是第一次看到哩！我替纸币雕刻一些花纹和对号，我和凯谋一同到柏林敦跑了一趟，在那里我满意地完成了整个任务，他因此获得了一笔巨款，使他可以有一个时期不致破产了。">查看中文翻译</div>

The latter was a shrewd, sagacious old man, who told me that he began for himself, when young, by wheeling clay for the brick-makers, learned to write after be was of age, carri'd the chain for surveyors, who taught him surveying, and he had now by his industry, acquir'd a good estate; and says he, "I foresee that you will soon work this man out of business, and make a fortune in it at Philadelphia." He had not then the least intimation of my intention to set up there or anywhere. These friends were afterwards of great use to me, as I occasionally was to some of them.

<div class="line_en">Before I enter upon my public appearance in business, it may be well to let you know the then state of my mind with regard to my principles and morals, that you may see how far those influenc'd the future events of my life. My parents had early given me religious impressions, and brought me through my childhood piously in the Dissenting way. But I was scarce fifteen, when, after doubting by turns of several points, as I found them disputed in the different books I read, I began to doubt of Revelation itself. Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's Lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but, each of them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker), and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not very useful. My London pamphlet, which had for its motto these lines of Dryden:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我讲述我正式开业之前，最好让你知道当时我对道德伦理的看法，让你可以看出这些观念是怎样地影响我未来生命中的大事的。我父母在早年就对我灌输了宗教思想，在我童年时代我受了虔诚的非国教徒的教养。由于在我所读到的各种书籍里我发现对教条有争辩，我自己对于教条中的某几点也先后发生了怀疑，接着，当我还不到十五岁时，我开始对《圣经》本身发生怀疑了。我偶然碰到了一些反对自然神教的书籍，据说这些书是博尔演讲中讲道文的大意。它们对我的影响恰巧跟它们的原意相反，因为为了驳斥自然神教，它们引证了自然神教信徒的议论，但是这些议论在我看来却比那些反驳它们的理论还坚强有力。简单地说，不久我就成为一个彻头彻尾的自然神教信徒了。我的议论带引一些人走上了歧途，特别是高令斯和雷夫，但是这两个人后来都毫无良心地大大地害了我，想到了基夫对我的行为（他是另一个宗教上的自由思想者）和我自己对佛南和李得小姐的行为，这种行为有时使我十分苦恼，我开始觉得这种教义虽然或许是真的，但是它不十分有益。我的伦敦小册子引用了德莱登的诗作为箴言：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Whatever is, is right. Though purblind man Sees but a part o' the chain, the nearest link: His eyes not carrying to the equal beam, That poises all above;" and from the attributes of God, his infinite wisdom, goodness and power, concluded that nothing could possibly be wrong in the world, and that vice and virtue were empty distinctions, no such things existing, appear'd now not so clever a performance as I once thought it; and I doubted whether some error had not insinuated itself unperceiv'd into my argument, so as to infect all that follow'd, as is common in metaphysical reasonings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“存在即是合理，虽然半瞎的人，只看见链条的一端，最近的一环，他的两眼看不到，上面那权衡一切的秤杆。”在那本小册子里我从上帝的属性，他的无限智慧、善良与权力得到结论说世界上的一切事物全都是对的，恶与善是一种虚空的区别，根本就没有善恶。现在看起来这篇文章并不像我过去曾经一度认为的那样的巧妙杰作。因此我猜想某些错误可能会不知不觉地混入我的论断，以致影响随之而来的全部理论，这原是在形而上学的推论中常见的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life; and I form'd written resolutions, which still remain in my journal book, to practice them ever while I lived. Revelation had indeed no weight with me, as such; but I entertain'd an opinion that, though certain actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them, yet probably these actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in their own natures, all the circumstances of things considered. And this persuasion, with the kind hand of Providence, or some guardian angel, or accidental favorable circumstances and situations, or all together, preserved me, thro' this dangerous time of youth, and the hazardous situations I was sometimes in among strangers, remote from the eye and advice of my father, without any willful gross immorality or injustice, that might have been expected from my want of religion. I say willful, because the instances I have mentioned had something of necessity in them, from my youth, inexperience, and the knavery of others. I had therefore a tolerable character to begin the world with; I valued it properly, and determin'd to preserve it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="渐渐地我确信在人与人之间的相互关系中对人生的幸福最重要的莫过于真实、诚意和廉洁。我写下了我的决心（这决心书还在日记中），要在我的一生中不断地加以实践。《圣经》本身对我并没有重要性，但是我认为：虽然我们不能因为《圣经》禁止某些行动，就说这些行动是坏的，或是因为《圣经》叫我们做，所以就认为是好的，但是当我们考虑了事物的各种情况以后，也许正因为它们对我们不利，所以我们要禁止这些行动，或是正因为这种行动的本身于我们有益，所以我们要去做。这种信念，靠着上帝或是守护天使的祝福，或是偶然的有利情况或形势，或是三者合起来，保全了我，使我经过了青年的危险期，使我在没有父亲在旁照顾和忠告的情况下，安全地经过了有时我在陌生人中间所陷入的险境，而竟然没有任何故意的粗鄙的不道德或不正义行为，由于我的缺乏宗教信仰，这种错误或许原是在意料中的。我说故意的，因为我上面所提到的那些实例，由于我年轻，缺乏经验，由于别人的无赖行为，都包括一些必然性在其中。因此在开始进入社会时，我的品德还总算是过得去的。我正当地重视我这个品德，并且决心保持它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We had not been long return'd to Philadelphia before the new types arriv'd from London. We settled with Keimer, and left him by his consent before he heard of it. We found a house to hire near the market, and took it. To lessen the rent, which was then but twenty-four pounds a year, tho' I have since known it to let for seventy, we took in Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, and his family, who were to pay a considerable part of it to us, and we to board with them. We had scarce opened our letters and put our press in order, before George House, an acquaintance of mine, brought a countryman to us, whom he had met in the street inquiring for a printer. All our cash was now expended in the variety of particulars we had been obliged to procure, and this countryman's five shillings, being our first-fruits, and coming so seasonably, gave me more pleasure than any crown I have since earned; and the gratitude I felt toward House has made me often more ready than perhaps I should otherwise have been to assist young beginners.</div>

<div class="line_en">There are croakers in every country, always boding its ruin. Such a one then lived in Philadelphia; a person of note, an elderly man, with a wise look and a very grave manner of speaking; his name was Samuel Mickle. This gentleman, a stranger to me, stopt one day at my door, and asked me if I was the young man who had lately opened a new printing-house. Being answered in the affirmative, he said he was sorry for me, because it was an expensive undertaking, and the expense would be lost; for Philadelphia was a sinking place, the people already half-bankrupts, or near being so; all appearances to the contrary, such as new buildings and the rise of rents, being to his certain knowledge fallacious; for they were, in fact, among the things that would soon ruin us. And he gave me such a detail of misfortunes now existing, or that were soon to exist, that he left me half melancholy. Had I known him before I engaged in this business, probably I never should have done it. This man continued to live in this decaying place, and to declaim in the same strain, refusing for many years to buy a house there, because all was going to destruction; and at last I had the pleasure of seeing him give five times as much for one as he might have bought it for when he first began his croaking.</div>

<div class="line_en">But my giving this account of it here is to show something of the interest I had, every one of these exerting themselves in recommending business to us. Breintnal particularly procur'd us from the Quakers the printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done by Keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was low. It was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer notes. I compos'd of it a sheet a day, and Meredith worked it off at press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before I had finished my distribution for the next day's work, for the little jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. But so determin'd I was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that one night, when, having impos'd my forms, I thought my day's work over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to pi, I immediately distributed and compos'd it over again before I went to bed; and this industry, visible to our neighbors, began to give us character and credit; particularly, I was told, that mention being made of the new printing-office at the merchants' Every-night club, the general opinion was that it must fail, there being already two printers in the place, Keimer and Bradford; but Dr. Baird (whom you and I saw many years after at his native place, St. Andrew's in Scotland) gave a contrary opinion: "For the industry of that Franklin," says he, "is superior to any thing I ever saw of the kind; I see him still at work when I go home from club, and he is at work again before his neighbors are out of bed." This struck the rest, and we soon after had offers from one of them to supply us with stationery; but as yet we did not chuse to engage in shop business.</div>

We could not then employ him; but I foolishly let him know as a secret that I soon intended to begin a newspaper, and might then have work for him. My hopes of success, as I told him, were founded on this, that the then only newspaper, printed by Bradford, was a paltry thing, wretchedly manag'd, no way entertaining, and yet was profitable to him; I therefore thought a good paper would scarcely fail of good encouragement. I requested Webb not to mention it; but he told it to Keimer, who immediately, to be beforehand with me, published proposals for printing one himself, on which Webb was to be employ'd. I resented this; and, to counteract them, as I could not yet begin our paper, I wrote several pieces of entertainment for Bradford's paper, under the title of the BUSY BODY, which Breintnal continu'd some months. By this means the attention of the publick was fixed on that paper, and Keimer's proposals, which we burlesqu'd and ridicul'd, were disregarded. He began his paper, however, and, after carrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety subscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle; and I, having been ready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and it prov'd in a few years extremely profitable to me.</div>
