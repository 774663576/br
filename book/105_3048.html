<div class="line_en">He was sitting on a hill to the left of the tunnel entrance, his hands wrapped around his knees, and he was staring at her. From this far away all that she could tell was that he was a boy, probably a teenager, with sandy hair that was being tossed around by the wind. He didn't stand or even smile when he saw her looking at him, just continued to stare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他手抱膝坐在隧道口左侧的山坡上，眼睛紧盯着她。隔得这么远，她只能看清他是个男孩，也许十几岁的年纪，浅黄色的头发在风中飘动。他看到迪伦正在看着自己，却没有站起来，甚至笑也没笑一下，只是继续凝望着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was something odd about the way that he sat there, a solitary figure in this isolated place. Dylan couldn't imagine how he had come to be there, unless he'd been on the train as well. She waved at him, glad to have someone to share this horror with, but he didn't wave back. She thought she saw him sit up a little straighter, but he was so far away it was hard to tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他孤零零地坐在这么一个荒凉的地方，样子有点奇怪。迪伦想象不出他怎么会到那里，除非他也是车上的乘客。她朝他挥手，很高兴终于有人能和她一起分担这份恐惧感，但他却没有任何回应。她感觉自己能看到他坐直了一点，但离得太远了实在难以分辨清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Keeping her eyes firmly on him, just in case he disappeared, she slipped and slid down the gravel bank of the train tracks and hopped over a little ditch filled with water and weeds. There was a barbed-wire fence separating the tracks from the open countryside. Dylan gingerly grabbed the top wire between two of the twisted metal knots and pulled it downwards as hard as she could. It dropped just low enough for her to awkwardly swing her legs over. She caught her foot as she pulled her second leg over and almost fell, but she managed to cling on to the wire and keep her balance. The barbs cut into her palm, though, piercing the skin and causing little droplets of blood to ooze through. She examined her hand briefly before rubbing it against her leg. A dark stain on her jeans made her take a second look. There was a large red patch on the outside of her thigh. She stared at it for a moment before remembering wiping her hand to get rid of the sticky stuff on the carriage floor. Realisation made her blanch and her stomach heaved slightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的眼睛牢牢盯着他，生怕他一下子不见了踪影。她跌跌撞撞地顺着铁轨旁的砾石堆走，越过一条满是杂草的水沟。一道带铁丝网的栅栏将铁轨和乡野的空地隔开，迪伦小心翼翼地抓着两个扭在一起的金属结中间的铁丝网上端，使劲地把它往下拽。铁丝网稍稍垂下来一点，刚好可以让她毫无美感地把腿迈过去。当她迈另一条腿的时候，脚被绊了一下，人几乎栽倒。她尽力抓紧铁丝网，身体虽保持住了平衡，但铁丝却扎进手掌里，刺透了皮肤，血渗了出来。她匆匆查看了一下手上的伤口，在腿上蹭了蹭。牛仔裤上深色的斑点让她忍不住又看了一眼。大腿外侧的裤子上有一大片殷红，她盯着看了一会儿，突然想起手上曾经沾了车厢地板上那些黏糊糊的东西，然后又在腿上蹭掉了。认清这是什么之后，她的脸色吓得煞白，胃里也微微有些翻腾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy on the hill appraised the girl approaching him with cold eyes. He had been watching her since she had exited the tunnel, emerging from the dark like a frightened rabbit from a burrow. Rather than shouting to get her attention, he had simply waited for her to see him. At one point he had been concerned that she would head back into the tunnel, and he had considered calling out, but she had changed her mind, and so he'd contented himself with sitting silently. She would notice him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在迪伦朝自己走来时，山坡上的男孩只是在冷眼旁观。自从走出隧道口，他就一直注视着她。看着她像一只逃出洞穴的兔子一样惊魂未定。他没有高声喊叫以吸引她的注意，而是等着她看到自己．有那么一会儿，他还担心她会掉头返回隧道，想着要不要把她喊回来，但她很快又回心转意了。于是，他也就乐得静静等待，她早晚会看到自己的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shaking her head to rid herself of the sick images that were swirling in her brain, she turned from the fence and fixed her eyes back on her target. He was seated on the slope about fifty metres above her. From this distance she could see his face, and so she smiled in greeting. He didn't respond. Slightly abashed by this cold reception, Dylan stared at the ground as she made her way up the hill towards him. It was a hard climb and before long she was panting. The hillside was steep and the long grass was wet and difficult to wade through. Looking down, concentrating on her feet, gave her an excuse not to make eye contact; not until she had to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她摇摇头，想甩掉脑海里浮现的那些令人作呕的画面。她从栅栏那儿回过身，眼睛重新盯紧目标。他坐在距离自己大概五十多米高的山坡上，在这个距离，她可以看清他的脸。迪伦一笑，算是跟他打招呼，可他却毫无反应。受此冷遇不免让迪伦感到有些难为情，于是她在费力爬山一路向他走来的时候，眼睛一直盯着地。山路难行，没一会儿工夫她就气喘吁吁了。山坡陡峭，疯长的杂草不仅潮湿，而且极难爬过。迪伦只得低着头盯着自己的脚，正好有借口可以不用和他交换眼神。直到迫不得已时她才抬起头看他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="终于见面了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was right. She spotted him and he saw the relief pool in her eyes as she waved energetically. He did not wave back. He watched her face falter slightly, but then she left the train track and began to approach him. She moved clumsily, catching herself on the barb-wire fence and tripping on clumps of wet grass. When she was close enough to read his expression he turned his face away, listening to the sound of her drawing nearer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想得没错。她注意到了他，当迪伦使劲朝他挥手时，他看到了她如释重负后眼中的那一汪泪水。他没有朝她挥手，他看到她神色微微有些迟疑，但过了一会儿，她还是离开了铁轨朝他走来。她笨手笨脚地挪着步子，自己卡在铁丝网围栏上，在湿漉漉的杂草间摔倒。当迪伦走得足够近，近到已经能看清他脸上表情的时候，他把脸扭到了一边，听着她离自己越来越近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last Dylan reached where he sat and was able to get a much better look at him. Her guess at his age had been spot on; he couldn't have been more than a year older than her, if that. He was wearing jeans, trainers and a warm-looking navy jumper with the word Broncos written across it in flowing orange letters. Curled up as he was, it was hard to guess at his size, but he didn't look small or weedy. He was quite tanned, with a line of freckles marching across his nose. His face was set in a hard, disinterested mask, and as soon as Dylan got closer to him, he'd began to stare off into the desolate landscape. Even when she stood right in front of him, he didn't change his expression or the direction of his stare. It was very disconcerting and Dylan fidgeted where she stood, unsure of what to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦终于走到了他坐的山坡，可以仔细端详他了。她对他年龄的猜测完全正确。这样的话，他最多比她大一岁。他穿着牛仔裤和跑鞋，一件看起来很温暖的深蓝色套衫，上面用橘红色花体字印着“Broncos”（野马）。虽然他就蜷腿坐在那里，但他的身材却很难推测，不过他看上去不是那种矮小孱弱的人。他皮肤黝黑，鼻子上有一排雀斑。迪伦一靠近他，他脸上就带了一副无动于衷、漠不关心的表情，眼神开始移到远处的荒野上。甚至当迪伦径直站在他面前时，他还是面色不改，眼神未变。这可真让人仓皇失措。迪伦站在那里手足无措，不知道该说些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tristan," he eventually replied, glancing at her briefly, and then looking away again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦。”他终于开了腔。他扫了她一眼，然后视线又转到别处了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hi, I'm Dylan," she mumbled at last, looking down at the ground. Waiting for a response, she shifted her weight from one foot to the other and stared off in the same direction, wondering what he was looking at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨！我叫迪伦。”她最后还是嗫嚅着开了口，眼睛盯着地皮。她等着他回应，身体的重心在两只脚之间挪来挪去，最后干脆也朝他凝视的方向望去，想弄明白他究竟在看什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Relieved that he had at least responded, Dylan made another stab at conversation. "I guess you were on the train, too. I'm so glad I'm not the only one here! I must have passed out in the carriage and when I woke up I was on my own." She said all of this very fast, nervous of his frosty welcome. "All of the other passengers had already got out and apparently nobody had noticed me there. There was this stupid woman with all these bags and stuff -- I got stuck under them. When I got out, I couldn't tell which way everybody had gone, but we must have come out of the wrong side of the tunnel. I bet the firemen and police and everybody else are on the other side."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他总算有了点反应，这让迪伦松了一口气，赶紧见缝插针道：“我猜你也是在火车上吧。还好我还不是一个人在这儿。我一定是在车厢里昏过去了。等我醒过来，就只剩我一个人了。”她说这一番话的时候语速很快，生怕又遭到冷遇，“其他乘客都已经逃出来了，很明显没有人注意到我。车上有个蠢女人，大包小包一大堆东西，我是被她的东西卡住了。我逃出车厢的时候，自己也不清楚其他人往哪边去了，但是我们一定是搞错了出隧道的方向。我敢打赌，现在消防队员、警察还有其他人都在隧道的另一头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Train?" He turned towards her and she got her first look into his eyes. They were icy blue and cold. Cobalt. She felt like they could freeze her blood if they were angry, but just now they were merely curious. They appraised her for half a second before flickering to the tunnel mouth. "Right. The train."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“火车？”他朝她转过身子，直到此时，她才第一次看清他的眼睛，那双冰蓝色的眼睛冷冷的，钴蓝色。她感觉如果这双眼睛发了怒，一定能把她的血液都冻得凝固，不过此刻这双眼流露出的只有好奇。他打量了她半秒钟，然后又瞥了一眼隧道口，“对，那辆火车。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy turned the force of his gaze back on her and she had to stop herself taking an involuntary step backwards. His eyes were magnetic, and they seemed to see through to her very core. Dylan felt exposed, almost naked, under his stare. Unconsciously, she folded her arms across her chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩回头凝视着她，她自告奋勇想再退回去，这绝对不行。他的眼神中带着磁石一般的吸引力，似乎一下子就能把她看透。迪伦感觉自己在他的目光下似乎一览无遗，简直赤身裸体。她下意识地双臂交叉护住了胸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked at him expectantly, but he didn't seem inclined to say anything else. Biting her lip, she cursed her luck that the only other person here was a teenage boy. An adult would've known what to do. Also, although she hated to admit it, boys like this made her nervous. They seemed so cool and confident, and she always ended up getting tongue-tied and feeling like a total idiot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她满怀期望地看着他，但他似乎不想再多说一句。迪伦咬着嘴唇，暗自诅咒自己的坏运气，在这儿就遇到这么一个人，结果还是个十几岁的小毛孩。要是个成年人，他肯定知道该怎么办。而且，尽管她不想承认，但是这样的男孩子总让她心情紧张。他们似乎酷酷的自信心满满。遇到他们，她老是张口结舌，感觉自己完全像个白痴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, we can't get through there." His voice was disinterested, as if he wasn't worried at all about their current predicament. As if he could quite happily sit on this hillside for ever. Well, Dylan thought, I can't. After staring at her for another long moment, he went back to glaring at the hills. Dylan bit her bottom lip as she tried to think of something else to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我们不能再穿回去了。”他的嗓音不带一点感情色彩，好像他对眼前的困境满不在乎，好像他可以在这个山坡上安安静静、快快乐乐地坐上一辈子。好吧，迪伦想，这我可做不到。盯了她很久之后，他重又回过头凝视群山。迪伦咬着下嘴唇，搜肠刮肚找别的话说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe we should walk back through the tunnel?" she suggested. Although that would mean passing by the train again, it didn't seem like such an awful proposition with someone else. Then they could meet up with all the other passengers and the emergency services, and she might still be able to salvage her weekend with her dad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要不我们再从隧道里穿回去？”她建议道。尽管她的建议意味着要再次经过那列火车，但和人结伴而行似乎还不算是一个坏主意。然后他们就能遇到其他乘客和紧急救援人员，原来说好这个周末和老爸见面的，说不定还能补救。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh." She was getting annoyed now. They were stuck here, on the wrong side of the tunnel, with no adults and no way to contact people and he was being no help at all. However, he was the only person here. "Well, what should we do, then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”迪伦开始懊恼起来，他们就困在这里，困在隧道一个错误的出口。既没有大人，也没有办法联系其他人，而这个男孩一点忙又帮不上。但，这里毕竟只有他这一个人，“好吧，那我们该怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, do you have a phone, then, so we can call someone, like the police or something? My phone died in the crash. And I should probably call my mum; when she hears what's happened she'll freak. She's very overprotective and she'll want to know I'm okay so that she can say 'I told you so'…" Dylan trailed off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，你有手机吧，我们给警察或者其他什么人打个电话总可以吧？我的手机在发生事故的时候死机了。我还要给我妈打个电话，她要是听说发生了什么，准保会疯掉。她的保护意识特别强，她想知道我是不是好好的，这样她就可以开始唠叨‘早就告诉过你了嘛’……”迪伦的声音越来越小，最后自己住了口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time he didn't even look at her. "Phones don't work out here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次他连看都没看她一眼就说：“电话在这儿打不通。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead of answering her, he suddenly stood up. Upright, he towered above her, much taller than she would have guessed. He looked down at her, a half-smirk playing on his lips, and started to walk away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有回答，而是突然站了起来。他笔直地站着，比她高出一大截，比她刚才目测的还要高得多。他俯视着她，嘴唇间半是幸灾乐祸的表情，然后开始向前走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan's mouth opened and closed a few times but no sound came out. She was transfixed, motionless and mute, shocked and intimidated by this strange boy. Was he just going to leave her here? She got her answer quickly. He went about ten metres, then stopped, turned, and looked back at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的嘴张了几下，却一个音也发不出来。她愣在了那里，动也不动，一声也不吭，完全被这个陌生的男孩惊呆了、吓傻了。他要把她一个人丢在这儿吗？她很快就有了答案。他走出十米远，又停住脚步，回头看着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Coming where?" Dylan asked, reluctant to leave the site of the train crash. Surely staying here was the most sensible thing to do? How would anybody find them if they went wandering off? Besides, how did he know where he was going? It was already late afternoon and it would be dark soon. The wind was getting up and it was cold; she didn't want to get lost and have to spend the night roughing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去哪儿啊？”迪伦问，她不想离开事故现场。待在原地一定不是最明智的选择吗？要是走远了，别人怎么发现他们呢？而且，他又怎么知道要朝哪儿走呢？现在已经很晚了，天马上就要黑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You coming?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你走吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think we should both stay here," she began, but he was already shaking his head. Looking as if it was extremely inconvenient, he walked back over and stared at her, so close she could feel his breath on her face. Dylan looked into his eyes and felt her surroundings fade away. His gaze was compelling; she couldn't have looked away if she'd wanted to. There was no other word for it; she was mesmerised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得我们两个都应该留在这儿。”她刚一张嘴，他就已经在摇头了。就像是说话很不方便似的，他又往回走了几步，目不转睛地看着她。他们两人挨得非常近，近到她脸上能感受到男孩的呼吸。迪伦直视他的双眼，周围的一切都慢慢模糊起来。他的眼神有一种让人不得不看的魔力，哪怕迪伦想要把自己的目光移开也不可能。不用多说，迪伦被他催眠了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But his self-assurance had her doubting herself. He seemed to see the indecision in her face. He gave her a patronising look, his voice dripping with superiority. "Well, I'm not just going to sit and wait. You can stay here if you want."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起风了，寒风凛冽。她不想迷路，打算就在野地凑合一晚上。他的自信让迪伦开始怀疑自己的判断。他似乎看出了她脸上的犹豫，居高临下地看了她一眼，声音里满是优越感：“好吧，我可不会就坐在这儿等。你要是愿意就自己待在这儿吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan's eyes widened in fear at the thought of being left alone, waiting. What if night fell and nobody came?</div>
