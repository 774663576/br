<div class="line_en">"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly. -- It depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this differently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities. -- No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly."</div>

<div class="line_en">The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family, the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour. The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte-a very elegant looking instrument-not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece-entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter; -- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客人相当多，因为还请来了另一家人，这是个正正派派、无可非议的乡下人家，是科尔夫妇特别器重的朋友。此外，还请上了科尔家男系的亲属，海伯里的律师。那些不怎么尊贵的女宾，将跟贝茨小姐、费尔法克斯小姐、史密斯小姐一起，到晚上才来。可吃饭时，由于人太多，很难找到大家都感兴趣的话题。等谈过了政局和埃尔顿先生之后，爱玛可以全神贯注地听她的邻座讲些令人愉快的话。她听见从远处传来而又觉得不能不听的第一个声音，是有人提起了简•费尔法克斯的名字。科尔太太似乎在讲一件有关她的事，像是很有趣。她听了听，发现很值得一听。爱玛那富于幻想的可贵特点，这下可就有了颇为有趣的发挥余地了。科尔太太说她去看望了贝茨小姐，一进屋就见到了一架钢琴——一架非常漂亮的钢琴——不算很高级，而是一架很大的方形钢琴。爱玛又是惊讶，又是询问，又是祝贺，贝茨小姐在一旁做解释，到头来，这故事的主要意思，是想说明这架钢琴是头一天从布罗德伍德琴行运来的，使姨妈和外甥女大吃一惊，全然没有料到。据贝茨小姐说，起初简自己也莫名其妙，困惑不解，想不出会是谁定购的——不过，她们现在可是确信无疑了，认为这东西只能来自一个人：不用说，一准是坎贝尔上校送的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated by her-and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his side.</div>

<div class="line_en">"One can suppose nothing else," added Mrs. Cole, "and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse to surprize her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁也不会料想是别人送的，”科尔太太接着说道。“我只是感到惊奇，怎么还会产生怀疑。不过，简好像最近才接到他们的一封信，只字没提这件事。她最了解他们的习性，可我倒觉得，不能因为只字不提，就断定礼物不是他们送的。他们也许是想给她来个出其不意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction! -- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with. -- I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it. -- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我敢说，我从没听过这么令人高兴的事！简•费尔法克斯琴弹得那么好，却没有一架钢琴，真叫我气不过。尤其考虑到，许多人家放着很好的钢琴没人弹，真是太不像话了。这真像给了我们一记耳光啊！昨天我还跟科尔先生说，我一看见客厅里那架崭新的大钢琴还真感到脸红。我自己连音符都分辨不清，而那几个姑娘才刚刚开始学，也许一辈子也不会有出息。而简•费尔法克斯可真够可怜的，那么有音乐天赋，却没有一样乐器供她消遣，连一件最简单的旧古钢琴都没有。我昨天还跟科尔先生说过这话，他完全同意我的看法。不过，他太喜欢音乐了，禁不住把钢琴买下来了，希望哪位好邻居肯赏赏光，偶尔来我们家弹一弹。我们正是出于这一考虑，才买下这架钢琴的——不然的话，我们准会感到羞愧的。我们非常希望今晚能劳驾伍德豪斯小姐试试这架钢琴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“迪克逊先生。言之有理。是的，我马上意识到，这一定是迪克逊夫妇联合送的。你知道，我们那天还说起过，迪克逊先生非常热烈地赞赏费尔法克斯小姐的演奏。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪克逊夫人！真有可能啊。我没想到迪克逊夫人。她一定像她父亲一样，知道送钢琴是十分受欢迎的。这事做得又神秘又突然，也许更像是一位年轻女士筹划的，而不像是上了年纪的人干的。我敢说就是迪克逊夫人。我跟你说过，你猜疑什么我也会跟着猜疑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before. -- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse. -- In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是呀，你跟我讲的这个情况，证实了我原先的一个看法。我倒并非想怀疑迪克逊先生或费尔法克斯小姐的好意，而是情不自禁地在猜疑，要么是他向她的朋友求婚后，不幸地爱上了她，要么是他察觉到她对他有点意思。人们进行猜测，可能猜二十次也猜不对一次。不过我敢肯定，她不跟坎贝尔夫妇去爱尔兰，却宁可到海伯里来，其中必有特别原因。在这儿，她必须过着清贫、苦修的生活；在那儿，本可以尽情享乐。至于说想呼吸一下家乡的空气，我看那仅仅是个借口而已。要是夏天，那倒还说得过去。可是在一月、二月、三月，家乡的空气能给人带来什么好处呢？身体娇弱的人往往更需要熊熊的炉火和舒适的马车，我敢说她的情况正是如此。我并不要求你全盘接受我的猜疑，尽管你慨然宣称你是这么做的。不过，我老实告诉你我猜疑的是什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection. There she sat-and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved-yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain-by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.</div>

He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room -- hated sitting long-was always the first to move when he could -- that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over parish business-that as long as he had staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether-thought it so abundant in agreeable families -- that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without considerable address at times, that he could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.</div>

I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. `Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!' -- but with many, many thanks --`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite surprized; -- very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a very kind attention-and so thoughtful an attention! -- the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.

Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health-his concern that she should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points! -- Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me-this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in love."</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize-a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual followed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.</div>

<div class="line_en">With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again. They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children-a most mortifying change, and material loss to them all; -- a very great deduction from her father's daily comfort-and, as to herself, she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to! -- No-Mr. Knightley must never marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.</div>

Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where-was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space.
