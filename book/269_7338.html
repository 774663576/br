<div class="line_en">We began the steep climb, and the road grew congested. As we wound higher, the cars became too close together for Alice to weave insanely between them anymore. We slowed to a crawl behind a little tan Peugeot.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cars continued to edge forward, one car length at a time. The sun beamed down brilliantly, seeming already overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车辆继续前行，一辆又一辆地和我们擦身而过。太阳光强烈地照射着，好像已经是当头直照了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cars crept one by one toward the city. As we got closer, I could see cars parked by the side of the road with people getting out to walk the test of the way. At first I thought it was just impatience -- something I could easily understand. But then we came around a switchback, and I could see the filled parking lot outside the city wall, the crowds of people walking through the gates. No one was being allowed to drive through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车子一辆接一辆地向那座城市行驶。开近些了，我看见车辆都停在路边，人们下车步行。一开始我以为是他们等得不耐烦了，这样的感受我很能理解，但是当我们到了一个Z形路轨，我看到城墙外面的停车场上排满了车辆，成群的人们蜂拥进城门，没有人可以把车子开进城去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alice," I whispered urgently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爱丽丝。”我紧张地低声叫她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's the only way in," she tried soothe me. But her voice was too strained to comfort.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that I was looking, and we were crawling slowly enough to see, I could tell that it was very windy. The people crowding toward the gate gripped their hats and tugged their hair out of their faces. Their clothes billowed around them. I also noticed that the color red was everywhere. Red shirts, red hats, red flags dripping like long ribbons beside the gate, whipping in the wind -- as I watched, the brilliant crimson scarf one woman had tied around her hair was caught in a sudden gust. It twisted up into the air above her, writhing like it was alive. She reached for it, jumping in the air, but it continued to flutter higher, a patch of bloody color against the dull, ancient walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的车开得很慢，我看得出外面风很大。那些朝大门走去的人用手紧按住帽子，不停地拂去被风吹到脸上的头发，他们的衣服也被风吹得鼓鼓的。我还注意到到处是红色，红衬衫、红帽子、红色的旗子像长丝带般沿着城墙随风飘舞。我正出神地看着，有位妇女系在头上的鲜红头巾被一阵风刮飞了。头巾在她上方飞舞，仿佛是有了生命。那个妇女跳起来，想抢回头巾，可是它越飞越高，这座沉闷的古城上方就这样多了一块鲜红的色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The uniformed man motioned lazily, not paying attention. Alice accelerated, edging around him and heading for the gate. He shouted something at us, but held his ground, waving frantically to keep the next car from following our bad example.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个穿制服的人心不在焉地懒洋洋地指挥着，爱丽丝乘机加速，从他身边窜过，向大门驶去，他朝我们大叫，但是没有追上来，拼命地挥手阻止后面的车辆学我们的样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His face was dazed as he retrieved his hand and stared at the thick roll of money he now held. The outside bill was a thousand dollar bill.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a private tour," Alice said, flashing an alluring smile. She reached her hand out cf the window, into the sunlight. I froze, until I realized she was wearing an elbow-length, tan glove. She took his hand, still raised from tapping her window, and pulled it into the car. She put something into his palm, and folded his fingers around it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是私人观光车哦。”爱丽丝回答道，脸上洋溢着迷人的微笑。她一只手伸出窗外，暴露在阳光下。我惊呆了，后来才意识到她戴着到肘上的棕褐色的手套。她抓住守卫举着的叩车窗的手，把它扯进车内，把一样东西塞到他手中，让他握紧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is this a joke?" he mumbled.</div>

<div class="line_en">The street was very narrow, cobbled with the same color stones as the faded cinnamon brown buildings that darkened the street with their shade. It had the feel of an alleyway. Red flags decorated the walls, spaced only a few yards apart, flapping in the wind that whistled through the narrow lane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="街道非常狭窄，路上铺着的碎石颜色和路边褪色的棕褐色的建筑一样，这些建筑的影子使得道路更加阴暗。感觉就像在一条幽深的小巷一般，两边的墙上有红旗装饰，旗与旗相隔没多远。这些旗子迎风飘舞，在狭窄的小巷中呼呼作响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She drove in quick spurts and sudden stops, and the people in the crowd shook their fists at us and said angry words that I was glad I couldn't understand. She turned onto a little path that couldn't have been meant for cars; shocked people had to squeeze into doorways as we scraped by. We found another street at the end. The buildings were taller here; they leaned together overhead so that no sunlight touched the pavement -- the thrashing red flags on either side nearly met. The crowd was thicker here than anywhere else. Alice stopped the car. I had the door open before we were at a standstill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一下子加速一下子突然刹车，边上的行人向我们挥舞拳头，嘴里生气地骂着，真庆幸我听不懂他们说什么。她把车子拐到一条不适合车辆行驶的小道上，我们开过的时候，惊奇的行人不得不侧身贴在两边的房门上。在小道的尽头又有一条街，街上的建筑比之前的高，它们的顶层几乎连在一起，所以夹在中间的街道几乎晒不到阳光，而且在上头飘扬的旗子几乎连在了一起。这里的人群比哪儿都拥挤，爱丽丝停下车子，我还没等车停稳就把门打开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no pathway, no crevice between the close pressed bodies. I pushed against them furiously, fighting the hands that shoved back. I heard exclamations of irritation and even pain as I battled my way through, but none were in a language I understood. The faces were a blur of anger and surprise, surrounded by the ever-present red. A blond woman scowled at me, and the red scarf coiled around her neck looked like a gruesome wound. A child, lifted on a man's shoulders to see over the crowd, grinned down at me, his lips distended over a set of plastic vampire fangs.</div>

But both hands on the clock pointed up toward the pitiless sun, and, though I shoved viciously against the crowd, I knew I was too late. I wasn't halfway across. I wasn't going to make it. I was stupid and slow and human, and we were all going to die because of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was nearly crying with relief as I flung my leg over the edge and ran through the knee-deep water. It sprayed all around me as I thrashed my way across the pool. Even in the sun, the wind was glacial, and the wet made the cold actually painful. But the fountain was very wide; it let me cross the center of the square and then some in mere seconds.

His eyes were closed, the rings underneath them deep purple, his arms relaxed at his sides, his palms turned forward. His expression was very peaceful, like he was dreaming pleasant things.

<div class="line_en">Edward took my wrists -- his hands felt like stones in winter -- and lowered me into the blackness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华抓着我的手腕——他的手冷的像冬天的石头——把我放到漆黑的洞口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was silent and short. The air whipped past me for just half a second, and then, with a huff as I exhaled, Alice's waiting arms caught me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="掉下去的过程很快，没什么声音。空气所发出的声音如同我叹出的气一般，维持不到半秒钟。爱丽丝在下面摆好姿势等着接我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm right here, Bella," she reassured me. Her voice came from too far below to make me feel better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在这儿，贝拉。”她安慰我道。但是声音听起来好远，这并没让我感觉好一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I closed my eyes so I couldn't see the darkness, scrunching them together in terror, clamping my mouth shut so I wouldn't scream. Edward let me fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我闭上眼睛让自己看不见下面的漆黑与恐怖，同时紧闭着嘴巴防止自己叫出声来。爱德华放开了手，让我掉下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I crouched down, swinging my legs into the narrow gap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我蹲了下来，双脚在洞边晃着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I eyed the hole doubtfully. I imagine he would have gone first, if Demetri and Felix hadn't been waiting, smug and silent, behind us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我满怀疑虑的看着那个洞，我想要不是德米特里和菲利克斯不怀好意的跟在后面，埃德华一定会先下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was going to have bruises; her arms were very hard. She stood me upright.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我身上有些擦伤，她的手臂很有力，接着我的时候站的还直。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was dim, but not black at the bottom. The light from the hole above provided a faint glow, reflecting wetly from the stones under my feet. The light vanished for a second, and then Edward was a faint, white radiance beside me. He put his arm around me, holding me close to his side, and began to tow me swiftly forward. I wrapped both arms around his cold waist, and tripped and stumbled my way across the uneven stone surface. The sound of the heavy grate sliding over the drain hole behind us rang with metallic finality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞的底部光线很弱，但并不是没有光亮，洞口的微光从脚下的潮湿石头上反射过来。光线没有了一阵子，但是爱德化在我身边泛着微光。他把我紧紧地搂在身边，轻轻的往前带。我双手抱着他冰冷的腰，蹒跚的走在不平的路面上，后面排水沟盖上盖子的声音像是一种终结。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward held me tightly. He reached his free hand across his body to hold my face, too, his smooth thumb tracing across my lips. Now and then, I felt his face press into my hair. I realized that this was the only reunion we would get, and I clutched myself closer to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华紧紧地搂着我，他的一只手从身体的一边伸到我的脸上，光滑的拇指抚过我的嘴唇，我能感到他不时地把脸贴到我的头发上，我感觉到这是我们唯一的汇合方式，更加紧紧地靠向他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dim light from the street was quickly lost in the gloom. The sound of my staggering footsteps echoed through the black space; it sounded very wide, but I couldn't be sure. There were no sounds other than my frantic heartbeat and my feet on the wet stones -- except for once, when an impatient sigh whispered from behind me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="街上反过来的微光很快消失了，我不稳的脚步声在洞里回荡。洞应该很宽，可我不确定，除了自己的心跳和脚步声之外听不到其他——只有一次来自后面的不耐烦的叹气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For now, it felt like he wanted me, and that was enough to offset the horror of the subterranean tunnel and the prowling vampires behind us. It was probably no more than guilt -- the same guilt that compelled him to come here to die when he'd believed that it was his fault that I'd killed myself. But I felt his lips press silently against my forehead, and I didn't care what the motivation was. At least I could be with him again before I died. That was better than a long life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻我感觉到他需要我，而这足够抵消在地道里被吸血鬼尾随的恐怖。或许这只是内疚——他对于他的错误的离开造成我想自杀就到这儿找死而产生的内疚。但是当他问我额头的时候我并不在意他的动机。死前能和他在一起比活的更长更重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wished I could ask him exactly what was going to happen now. I wanted desperately to know how we were going to die -- as if that would somehow make it better, knowing in advance. But I couldn't speak, even in a whisper, surrounded as we were. The others could hear everything -- my every breath, my every heartbeat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想问他后面会发生什么。我想知道一会我们会怎样死去，或许提前知道会感觉好一些。但是我不能说话，即便是小声也也不行。别人什么都会听到包括我的呼吸与心跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The path beneath our feet continued to slant downward, taking us deeper into the ground, and it made me claustrophobic. Only Edward's hand, soothing against my face, kept me from screaming out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路一直往下，我们在向更深的地方走去，我越来越害怕。爱德华的手一直抚摸着我的脸才没让我叫出声来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, but it slowly turned dark gray instead of black. We were in a low, arched tunnel. Long trails of ebony moisture seeped down the gray stones, like they were bleeding ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我分辨不出光是从哪里来的，但它慢慢地变成了深灰色而不是黑色。我们在一个低拱的隧道里。长长的黑檀木的水分渗透到灰色的石头上，就像在流血的墨水一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was shaking, and I thought it was from fear. It wasn't until my teeth started to chatter together that I realized I was cold. My clothes were still wet, and the temperature underneath the city was wintry. As was Edward's skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我浑身颤抖让我以为自己很害怕，当牙齿开始作响我才觉得寒冷。我的衣服依然是湿的，地下城的温度冷得像冬天，也像爱德华的皮肤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of the tunnel was a grate -- the iron bars were rusting, but thick as my arm. A small door made of thinner, interlaced bars was standing open. Edward ducked through and hurried on to a larger, brighter stone room. The grille slammed shut with a clang, followed by the snap of a lock. I was too afraid to look behind me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地道的终点是一扇扶手已经生锈的门——那扶手和我手臂一样粗。有扇扶手细点的小门开着，爱德华很快的通过，进到一个稍大点有光线的石室。后面的铁门当的一声被关上并发出上锁的声音。我很害怕却没敢回头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other side of the long room was a low, heavy wooden door. It was very thick -- as I could tell because it, too, stood open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间的另一端有扇看起来很矮也很重的木门，门很厚——我看得出来是因为它开着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"N-n-no," I chattered, throwing my arms around him. I didn't care if I froze. Who knew how long we had left.</div>
