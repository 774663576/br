<div class="line_en">Maxim had to go up to London at the end of June to some public dinner. A man's dinner. Something to do with the county. He was away for two days and I was left alone. I dreaded his going. When I saw the car disappear round the sweep in the drive I felt exactly as though it were to be a final parting and I should never see him again. There would be an accident of course and later on in the afternoon, when I came back from my walk, I should find Frith white and frightened waiting for me with a message. The doctor would have rung up from some cottage hospital. "You must be very brave," he would say, "I'm afraid you must be prepared for a great shock."</div>

<div class="line_en">And Frank would come, and we would go to the hospital together. Maxim would not recognize me. I went through the whole thing as I was sitting at lunch, I could see the crowd of local people clustering round the churchyard at the funeral, and myself leaning on Frank's arm. It was so real to me that I could scarcely eat any lunch, and I kept straining my ears to hear the telephone should it ring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着又仿佛是弗兰克来了，我们就一起到医院去，迈克西姆已认不出我来。我就这么坐在午餐桌前，胡思乱想这一幕又一幕的情景。我想象有一大群本地人士来参加葬礼，围聚在教堂墓地的四周，我自己则倚傍着弗兰克的手臂。这一切在我看来是如此真切，以至我连餐桌上的饭菜一点也没碰．而且一直竖起耳朵，生怕错漏了电话铃声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I sat out in the garden under the chestnut tree in the afternoon, with a book on my lap, but I scarcely read at all.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我合上书本。“谢谢你，罗伯特。他这么快就到啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I saw Robert come across the lawn I knew it was the telephone and I felt physically sick. "A message from the club, Madam, to say Mr de Winter arrived ten minutes ago."</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right, Robert. Thanks very much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“知道了，罗伯特。多谢你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The relief was tremendous. I did not feel sick any more. The pain had gone. It was like coming ashore after a channel crossing. I began to feel rather hungry, and when Robert had gone back into the house I crept into the dining-room through the long window and stole some biscuits from the sideboard. I had six of them. Bath Olivers. And then an apple as well. I had no idea I was so empty. I went and ate them in the woods, in case one of the servants should see me on the lawn from the windows, and then go and tell the cook that they did not think Mrs de Winter cared for the food prepared in the kitchen, as they had just seen her filling herself with fruit and biscuits. The cook would be offended, and perhaps go to Mrs Danvers Now that Maxim was safe in London, and I had eaten my biscuits, I felt very well and curiously happy. I was aware of a sense of freedom, as though I had no responsibilities at all. It was rather like a Saturday when one was a child. No lessons, and no prep. One could do as one liked. One put on an old skirt and a pair of sand-shoes and played Hares and Hounds on the common with the children who lived next door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我大大松了一口气，再没有晕眩欲吐的感觉。心里的疑惧豁然开释，好似横渡过海峡安然抵达彼岸一般。我顿时感到饥肠辘辘，所以一等到罗伯特回进屋子，就立刻爬过长自，溜进餐厅，从食品柜里偷了些饼干。一共六块，是巴斯一奥利弗牌的。接着我又随手拿了个苹果。真没想到会饿得这么慌。我走到林子里才开始大嚼起来，生怕在草坪上吃会被窗口的仆人瞧见，那样一来，他们会到厨师面前搬口舌，说什么刚才看见德温特夫人用饼干和水果填肚子来着，想必是不喜欢厨房里做的饭菜。厨师当然就不高兴啦，说不定还会到丹弗斯太太面前抱怨几句呢。想到迈克西姆已平安抵达伦敦，再加上把那几块饼于吞进了肚子，我心情极为舒畅，甚至莫名其妙地感到快活。一种无拘无束的自由感在心头油然而生，大有无牵无挂一身轻的味道，好比是孩提时代度周末，既不用上课，也不要预习，爱干什么就干什么；可以套条旧裙子，穿双帆布鞋，跟邻屋小朋友在附近公共草地上一起玩“猎犬追野兔”的游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We went through the Happy Valley to the little cove. The azaleas were finished now, the petals lay brown and crinkled on the moss. The bluebells had not faded yet, they made a solid carpet in the woods above the valley, and the young bracken was shooting up, curling and green. The moss smelt rich and deep, and the bluebells were earthy, bitter. I lay down in the long grass beside the bluebells with my hands behind my head, and Jasper at my side. He looked down at me panting, his face foolish, saliva dripping from his tongue and his heavy jowl. There were pigeons somewhere in the trees above. It was very peaceful and quiet. I wondered why it was that places are so much lovelier when one is alone. How commonplace and stupid it would be if I had a friend now, sitting beside me, someone I had known at school, who would say "By the way, I saw old Hilda the other day. You remember her, the one who was so good at tennis. She's married, with two children." And the bluebells beside us unnoticed, and the pigeons overhead unheard. I did not want anyone with me. Not even Maxim. If Maxim had been there I should not be lying as I was now, chewing a piece of grass, my eyes shut. I should have been watching him, watching his eyes, his expression. Wondering if he liked it, if he was bored. Wondering what he was thinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们穿过幸福谷，朝小海湾走去。杜鹃花已经凋谢，皱曲的褐色的残花零落散在青苔地上。风信子花尚未凋零，在山谷尽头处的林子里铺下一层厚实的绒毯，花丛间还不时冒出一些卷曲嫩绿的羊齿草。答藓溢出阵阵深沉的浓香；风信子花飘散着带点苦涩的泥土味。我躺在风信子花旁的茂密草丛中，头搁在手掌上，杰斯珀守在我身边。它气喘吁吁地望着我，样子傻乎乎的，唾液沿着舌头和肥厚的下颚往下滴。林中某处枝头息着几只鸽于。四周一片恬静宁谧。我感到奇怪，为什么当你孓身独处时，同样的环境竟会显得那么可爱。这时候要是有个朋友，旧日的同窗，坐在我身旁絮叨：“喂，顺便告诉你，前几天我遇到老同学希尔达啦。你还记得她吗？就是那个打得一手好网球的同学。她已经结婚，有了两个孩子。”这该多杀风景，多无聊乏味。你就顾不上欣赏身旁的风信子花，也没法侧耳谛听头上鸽子的咕鸣。此刻我不希望有谁呆在身边，甚至迈克西姆也不例外。要是迈克西姆在这儿，我就不会像现在这么躺着，闭目养神，嘴里还嚼着一根青草。我一定是在一旁察颜观色，留神他的眼神和表情，心中暗自揣摩，这合他的心意呢还是让他感到烦腻，还得不时忖度他在想些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had just the same feeling. I had not felt like this all the time I had been at Manderley. It must be because Maxim had gone to London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当时的感觉正是这样。来曼陀丽后我还从未有过这样的感觉。想必是迈克西姆到伦敦而不在身边的缘故吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was rather shocked at myself. I could not understand it at all. I had not wanted him to go. And now this lightness of heart, this spring in my step, this childish feeling that I wanted to run across the lawn, and roll down the bank. I wiped the biscuit crumbs from my mouth and called to Jasper. Perhaps I was just feeling like this because it was a lovely day…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我竟产生这种大不敬的念头，为此我颇为吃惊。真不明白这是怎么回事。我不希望他离开身边。而现在却如此轻松愉快，步履轻盈，情不自禁地要像孩子那样，连蹦带跳地穿过草地，连滚带爬翻身下坡。我抹去嘴上的饼干屑，大声呼唤杰斯珀。哦，我所以有这种感觉，也许因为这是个阳光明媚的日子吧…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not that way, Jasper," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杰斯珀，别往那边去，”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, I did not mean that. It was disloyal, wicked. It was not what I meant. Maxim was my life and my world. I got up from the bluebells and called sharply to Jasper. We set off together down the valley to the beach. The tide was out, the sea very calm and remote. It looked like a great placid lake out there in the bay. I could not imagine it rough now, any more than I could imagine winter in summer. There was no wind, and the sun shone on the lapping water where it ran into the little pools in the rocks. Jasper scrambled up the rocks immediately, glancing back at me, one ear blown back against his head, giving him an odd rakish appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喔，不，我是说着玩的。这种邪念岂非是对爱情的背弃？我说的不是那个意思。迈克西姆是我的生命，我的一切。我从风信子花丛中站起身来，朝杰斯珀厉声吆喝。我们一块儿出了林子，沿山谷走向海滩。这时正值退潮，大海宁静而遥远。那边的海湾宛若平静如镜的浩瀚湖面。望着此刻的大海，怎能想象出它汹涌咆哮的情景，正如置身于炎夏之中岂能想象寒冬的萧瑟？周围没有一丝儿风，灿烂的阳光泻在轻轻拍岸的海水上；海水漫人礁石之中，形成一泓泓漩水洼。杰斯珀一溜烟爬上礁岩，扭头瞥了我一眼，一只耳朵往后耷拉在脑袋上。一副调皮的怪模样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now I could relax, none of these things mattered. Maxim was in London. How lovely it was to be alone again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而此刻我可以舒舒坦坦地躺着，全然不必为此操心。迈克西姆这会儿在伦敦。以后要是还有机会子身独处，那该有多美！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He cared nothing for me of course. He loped off, deliberately disobedient. "What a nuisance he is," I said aloud, and I scrambled up the rocks after him, pretending to myself I did not want to go to the other beach. "Oh, well," I thought, "it can't be helped. After all, Maxim is not with me. It's nothing to do with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它当然不听我的话，放开步子便往那边跑。“这个捣蛋鬼，”我说出声来，接着也纵身翻上礁岩，去追赶杰斯珀，似乎并不是我自己有意要闯到另一侧海滩去的。“唔，可不是？”我暗自嘀咕。“实在没法子。管他呢，反正迈克西姆不在身边。这总不能怪我啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I splashed through the pools on the rocks, humming a tune. The cove looked different when the tide was out. Less formidable. There was only about three foot of water in the tiny harbour. A boat would just float there comfortably I supposed, at dead low water. The buoy was still there. It was painted white and green, I had not noticed that before. Perhaps because it had been raining the colouring was indistinct. There was no one on the beach. I walked across the shingle to the other side of the cove, and climbed the low stone wall of the jetty-arm. Jasper ran on ahead as though it was his custom. There was a ring in the wall and an iron ladder descending to the water. That's where the dinghy would be tied, I suppose, and one would climb to it from the ladder. The buoy was just opposite, about thirty feet away. There was something written on it. I craned my neck sideways to read the lettering. "Je Reviens". What a funny name. Not like a boat. Perhaps it had been a French boat though, a fishing boat. Fishing boats sometimes had names like that; "Happy Return", "I'm Here", those sort of names. "Je Reviens" -- "I come back." Yes, I suppose it was quite a good name for a boat. Only it had not been right for that particular boat which would never come back again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我踩着礁石间的水洼，哼着小调向前走，退了潮的小海湾，看起来与涨潮时不一样，不再那么令人望而生畏，狭小的港湾里海水大约只有三英尺深。我想。在这平静的浅水中驾起轻舟，随波荡漾，确是够逍遥的。浮简还在老地方。上面漆着的是绿白两种颜色，这我上回可没有注意到。也许是由于那几天霪雨不止，色彩不甚清晰。海滩上阒无人影。我脚踩圆卵石，来到海湾的另一侧，爬上防波堤的石砌堤壁。杰斯珀俨然像是识途老马。跑在头里。堤壁上安着一只环，一架铁梯自上而下伸入水中。也许那皮筏就曾拴在这儿，而游人也是借这架铁梯上筏子的。浮简就在对面三十英尺的地方，上面还写着什么。我侧过身伸长脖子看上面的字：“JeReviens”。怪有趣的名字。这不像是一般的船名。不过那艘船原先也许是艘法国造的捕鱼船吧，渔船有时倒是起那种名字的，什么“平安归来”啦，“我还安在”啦，等等。“JeReviens”——“我归来”。不错，这是个挺吉祥的船名，可惜用在那条船上并不恰当，因为它一去不复返啦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jasper was sniffing at the iron ladder. "Come away," I said. "I don't want to go in after you." I went back along the harbour wall to the beach. The cottage did not seem so remote and sinister at the edge of the wood as it had done before. The sun made such a difference. No rain today, pattering on the roof. I walked slowly up the beach towards it. After all, it was only a cottage, with nobody living in it. There was nothing to be frightened of. Nothing at all. Any place seemed damp and sinister when it had been uninhabited for a certain time. Even new bungalows and places. Besides, they had moonlight picnics and things here. Week-end visitors probably used to come and bathe, and then go for a sail in the boat. I stood looking into the neglected garden choked with nettles. Someone ought to come and tidy it up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰斯珀用鼻子唤着那架铁梯子。“走吧，”我说，“我可不想跟着你转了。”我沿着港湾的堤壁走回海滩。林子边上的那座小屋显得不像上一次那么遥远，那么森然可怕。这种变化是由太阳引起的。今天，没有淅沥的雨点打在屋顶上，我顺着海滩朝小屋缓缓走去。说到底，那不过是座普通的小屋，里边又没住人，一点没什么好害怕的。不论什么地方，只要有一段时间不住人，总会显得潮湿、阴森，连新盖的平房和别墅也不例外。况且，他们还在这儿举行过月夜聚餐之类的娱乐活动。周末来客也许常上这儿来游泳遣兴，随后乘船在海面上兜风巡游。我站定身子。朝屋前那座无人照看的爬满尊麻的庭园打量了一番。得派人来清理一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It must be cold sailing out there in the bay, beyond the beacon away on the headland. The sea was calm in the bay, but even today, when it was so still, out there round the headland there was a ripple of white foam on the surface of the water where the tide was racing. A small boat would heel to the wind when she rounded the headland and came out of the landlocked bay. The sea would splash inboard perhaps, run down the deck. The person at the tiller would wipe spray out of her eyes and hair, glance up at the straining mast. I wondered what colour the boat had been. Green and white perhaps, like the buoy. Not very big, Frank had said, with a little cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果越过海岬处的灯塔，在那边的海湾航行，一定是够冷的。这儿海水平静如镜，可是那边海岬处，即使在今天这样风和日丽的日子，潮水也在奔腾不息，水面卷起一层白色的碎浪。小船一旦绕过海角，驶出陆地环抱的海湾，就得听凭风浪摆布，东倒西歪。海水也许会哗哗扑上船来，在甲板上漫溢横流。手扶舵桐的驾船者也许会拭去溅在她眼睛和头发上的水花，抬头向那绷得紧紧的风帆扫一眼。不知道那艘小船漆的是什么颜色，说不定也是绿白双色，和那个浮筒一样。船身不很大，有个小船舱，弗兰克曾这么对我说过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't, Jasper," I said. He went on sniffing deeply, his nose thrust to the crack. I pushed the door open and looked inside. It was very dark. Like it had been before. Nothing was changed. The cobwebs still clung to the rigging of the model boats. The door into the boat-store at the end of the room was open though. Jasper growled again, and there was a sound of something falling. Jasper barked furiously, and darting between my legs into the room he tore to the open door of the store. I followed him, heart beating, and then stood uncertainly in the middle of the room. "Jasper, come back, don't be a fool," I said. He stood in the doorway, still barking furiously, an hysterical note in his voice. Something was there then, inside the store. Not a rat. He would have gone for a rat. "Jasper, Jasper. Come here," I said. He would not come. I went slowly to the door of the store.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别这样，杰斯珀，”我说。它还是死劲在唤个不停，把鼻子探进门框里。我推开门，朝里边张望。屋里还是像上次那样黑洞洞的。一切依然如旧。蜘蛛网依然挂在船模的索具上。不过，屋子尽头那扇通向船库贮藏室的门却开着。杰斯珀又汪汪大叫起来，贮藏室里扑通一声，是什么东西掉到了地上。杰斯珀狂吠着从我跨下窜入屋内，随即朝洞开着的贮藏室门猛扑过去。我跟在它后面朝里走了几步，然后犹豫不决地站在屋子中央，心儿怦怦直跳。“杰斯珀，回来，别像个傻瓜，”我说。它站在门口，仍狂怒地吠叫不停，声音近乎歇斯底里，贮藏室里一定有什么东西。不像是耗子。如果是耗子，狗一定早扑上去了。“杰斯珀，杰斯珀，过来，”我说。可是它不肯过来，我提起脚步慢慢朝贮藏室门口走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I turned away and walked up the beach to the path dragging Jasper by his belt. Poor wretch, he was potty, of course. He did not know what he was talking about. It was hardly likely that anyone would threaten him with the asylum. Maxim had said he was quite harmless, and so had Frank. Perhaps he had heard himself discussed once, amongst his own people, and the memory of it lingered, like an ugly picture in the mind of a child. He would have a child's mentality too, regarding likes and dislikes. He would take a fancy to a person for no reason, and be friendly one day perhaps and sullen the next. He had been friendly with me because I had said he could keep the fishing line. Tomorrow if I met him he might not know me. It was absurd to notice anything said by an idiot. I glanced back over my shoulder at the cove. The tide had begun to run and was swirling slowly round the arm of the harbour wall. Ben had disappeared over the rocks. The beach was deserted again. I could just see the stone chimney of the cottage through a gap in the dark trees. I had a sudden unaccountable desire to run. I pulled at Jasper's leash and panted up the steep narrow path through the woods, not looking back any more. Had I been offered all the treasures in the world I could not have turned and gone down to the cottage or the beach again. It was as though someone waited down there, in the little garden where the nettles grew. Someone who watched and listened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转过身子，牵着杰斯珀沿海滩走上小路。可怜的家伙，谁都看得出他有些痴呆，语无伦次。谁会拿疯人院来吓唬他这样的人呢，似乎不大可能。迈克西姆说过他是个文痴，不会惹事的。弗兰克也这么说过。也许是他曾听到家里人议论过他的情况。从此这些话就一直留在他脑子里了，就像一幅丑陋的图画会始终京绕在孩子的记忆里那样。在个人好恶的问题上，他的智力也同孩子一样，他会无缘无故的喜欢某个人，今天和你好得什么似的，可明天又会拉长脸生你的气。他对我友好，无非是因为我说他可以把那根钓丝留着。到了明天再碰见他，说不定他就忘掉我是谁了。拿白痴的话当真，岂不荒唐可笑。我扭头又朝海湾瞥了一眼。那儿已开始涨潮，海水慢慢地在港口防坡堤周围激起漩涡。贝恩已翻过礁石走了。海滩上又空无人影。我从黑黝黝的树丛缺口处刚好看到小屋顶上的石砌烟囱。不知怎么的，我突然想拔腿逃跑。我牵着扣在杰斯珀颈圈上的皮带，气喘吁吁地沿着陡峭的小径，穿过林于，头也不回地往前奔跑。哪怕是把世界上所有的珍宝都给我，我也不愿再回那小屋或海滩去。好像有谁守候在那荨麻丛生的小庭园内，那人一直在注视着我，听着我讲话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quiet in a different way. And even as I ran and panted up the path I could hear the wash of the sea as the tide crept into the cove. I understood why Maxim disliked the path and the cove. I disliked it too. I had been a fool to come this way. I should have stayed on the other beach, on the white shingle, and come home by the Happy Valley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四周是一片异样的沉寂。我这么喘着气在小道上奔跑，耳边听得湖水涌入海湾时的阵阵涛声。我这才明白为什么迈克西姆不喜欢这条小径，不喜欢这个海湾。我也不喜欢。我真是个傻瓜，竟会上这儿来。我应该呆在那边的海滩上，在那片白色的圆卵石上散步，随后从幸福回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jasper barked as we ran together. He thought it was some new kind of game. He kept trying to bite the belt and worry it. I had not realized how closely the trees grew together here, their roots stretching across the path like tendrils ready to trip one. They ought to clear all this, I thought as I ran, catching my breath, Maxim should get the men on to it. There is no sense or beauty in this undergrowth. That tangle of shrubs there should be cut down to bring light to the path. It was dark, much too dark. That naked eucalyptus tree stifled by brambles looked like the white bleached limb of a skeleton, and there was a black earthy stream running beneath it, choked with the muddied rains of years, trickling silently to the beach below. The birds did not sing here as they did in the valley.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I wandered across the lawn to the terrace my eye was caught by a gleam of sunshine on something metal showing through the green of the rhododendron leaves at the turn in the drive. I shaded my eyes with my hand to see what it was. It looked like the radiator of a car. I wondered if someone had called. If they had though, they would have driven up to the house, not left their car concealed like that from the house, at the turn of the drive, by the shrubs. I went a little closer. Yes, it was a car all right. I could see the wings now and the hood. What a funny thing. Visitors never did that as a rule. And the tradesmen went round the back way by the old stables and the garage. It was not Frank's Morris. I knew that well. This was a long, low car, a sports car. I wondered what I had better do. If it was a caller Robert would have shown them into the library or the drawing-room. In the drawing-room they would be able to see me as I came across the lawn. I did not want to face a caller dressed like this. I should have to ask them to stay to tea. I hesitated, at the edge of the lawn. For no reason, perhaps because the sunlight flickered a moment on the glass, I looked up at the house, and as I did so I noticed with surprise that the shutters of one of the windows in the west wing had been opened up. Somebody stood by the window. A man. And then he must have caught sight of me because he drew back abruptly, and a figure behind him put up an arm and closed the shutters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当我信步穿过草坪走近平台时，车道拐弯处的石南绿叶丛中忽然射出一道强光，在我眼前一晃，那是太阳照在金属物体上的反光，我用手遮着眼睛看看究竟是什么。好像是汽车上散热器。我心想是不是来客了。不过，就算有客人来，他们也总是把车子直接开到屋子跟前，不会像现在这样，让车子停在远离屋子的车道转弯角上，还要藏在灌木丛里。我走近几步。一点也不错，是辆汽车。现在我可以看到汽车上的挡泥板，还有车篷。多怪的事啊。一般的客人从来不这么干。商人们也总是绕过旧马厩和车库打后面进来的。这不是弗兰克的莫里斯轿车，他那辆车我已很熟悉。而现在这辆，车身又长又低，是辆轻型汽车。我不知道该怎么办才好。要是果真有谁来访，罗伯特一定已将客人领进藏书室或客厅。而如果是领进了客厅，那我穿过草地时就会被他们看到。我可不想让客人瞧见我这身打扮。我还得留客人用茶点。我在草坪边上蜘蹰徘徊，拿不定主意。不知是什么缘故，可能是由于阳光在玻璃窗上忽地一闪吧，我偶尔抬头朝屋子看了一下。奇怪，就在我抬头张望的那一刹那，我注意到西厢房间有一扇百叶窗打开了。有人站在窗前，那是个男子。他一定也看到了我，因为他慌忙将身子缩了回去，而他背后的人立即伸出条胳膊，把窗关上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was glad to come out on to the lawn and see the house there in the hollow, solid and secure. The woods were behind me. I would ask Robert to bring me my tea under the chestnut tree. I glanced at my watch. It was earlier than I thought, not yet four. I would have to wait a bit. It was not the routine at Manderley to have tea before half past. I was glad Frith was out. Robert would not make such a performance of bringing the tea out into the garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我总算走出树林到了草坪，望见屹立在开阔地上的那幢坚实牢固的大宅，心头一阵喜悦。树林子已撇在身后。我要叫罗伯特把茶点送到栗子树下来。我看了看表，四点还不到，比我想象的要早呢。我还得稍等一会。按曼陀丽的规矩，不到四点半是不用茶点的。幸亏弗里思今天休息出去了，让罗伯特把茶点摆到外面花园里来，他倒不至于考究什么仪式。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides, the rooms in the west wing were not shown to the public. I had not even been into them myself yet. No, I knew it was not a public day. The public never came on a Tuesday. Perhaps it was something to do with a repair in one of the rooms. It was odd though the way the man had been looking out and directly he saw me he whipped back into the room and the shutters were closed. And the car too, drawn up behind the rhododendrons, so that it could not be seen from the house. Still, that was up to Mrs Danvers. It was nothing to do with me. If she had friends she took to the west wing it was not exactly my affair. I had never known it happen before though. Odd that it should occur on the only day Maxim was from home.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went up the steps and through the big front door to the hall. There was no sign of a strange cap or stick, and no card on the salver. Evidently this was not an official visitor. Well, it was not my affair. I went into the flower-room and washed my hands in the basin to save going upstairs. It would be awkward if I met them face to face on the stairs or somewhere. I remembered I had left my knitting in the morning-room before lunch, and I went along through the drawing-room to fetch it, the faithful Jasper at my heels. The morning-room door was open. And I noticed that my bag of knitting had been moved. I had left it on the divan, and it had been picked up and pushed behind a cushion. There was the imprint of a person on the fabric of the divan where my knitting had been before. Someone had sat down there recently, and picked up my knitting because it had been in the way. The chair by the desk had also been moved. It looked as though Mrs Danvers entertained her visitors in the morning-room when Maxim and I were out of the way. I felt rather uncomfortable. I would rather not know. Jasper was sniffing under the divan and wagging his tail. He was not suspicious of the visitor anyway. I took my bag of knitting and went out. As I did so the door in the large drawing-room that led to the stone passage and the back premises opened, and I heard voices. I darted back into the morning-room again, just in time. I had not been seen. I waited behind the door frowning at Jasper who stood in the doorway looking at me, his tongue hanging out, wagging his tail. The little wretch would give me away. I stood very still, holding my breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我提步跨上台阶，从正门走进大厅，不见有什么陌生的帽子或手杖，托盘里也没有名片，显然这人并不是正式来访的宾客。算了，这不关我的事。我走进花房，在盆里洗了手，这样就省得上楼去。在楼梯上或别的地方和他们劈头想遇，撞个正着，岂不尴尬。我记得午饭前编结活儿丢在晨室里了，于是就穿过客厅去取，忠实的杰斯珀寸步不离地跟在身后。晨室的门开着。我发现编结袋已被人移动过。原先我是把它搁在长沙发上的，可现在不知被谁拿起，塞到了坐垫后面。沙发上原来放编结活计的地方，留有被人坐过的痕迹。刚才有谁在那上面坐过，而我的编结活儿放着碍事，就随手把它拿开了。书桌旁的那把椅子也已挪动过。看来是丹弗斯太太趁迈克西姆和我都不在的当儿，在晨室里接待了她的客人。我感到很不舒服。我宁愿不知道有这么回事。杰斯珀在长沙发周围唤来唤去，不住摆动尾巴。不管怎么说，它没对陌生来客起什么疑心。我拿起编结袋，往门外走去。这时，通后屋而道的大客厅边门开了，我听到有人说话的声音。我立即退回展室，躲闪得还算及时，没让人看见。我躲在门背后，朝杰斯珀竖眉瞪眼，因为长耳狗正站在门口望着我，摇着尾巴，拖着舌头，这小坏蛋会坏事的。我屏息仁立，一动也不敢动。">查看中文翻译</div>
