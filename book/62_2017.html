<div class="line_en">I don't need this right now, Wallace thought angrily. A hospital board meeting was coming up, and there were already enough problems to be dealt with. Ben Wallace was well aware of the statistics. More than 10 percent of the doctors in the United States became addicted, at one time or another, to either drugs or alcohol. The easy accessibility of the drugs made them a temptation. It was simple for a doctor to open a cabinet, take out the drug he wanted, and use a tourniquet and syringe to inject it. An addict could need a fix as often as every two hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在不要出这种事，华莱士气冲冲地想着。医院董事会马上就要召开，要应付的问题已经够多的了。本·华莱士非常清楚统计数字显示的情况。在美国，有超过10％的医生在不同时间或者吸毒成瘾，或者酗酒成性。搞到毒品是很容易的事，这就成为一种诱惑。对一名医生来说，打开药柜，取出他所需要的麻醉药，然后用压脉器或是注射器打进身体，这是件很简单的事。一个瘾君子每两个小时就需要扎它一针。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it was happening at his hospital. Something had to be done about it before the board meeting. It would look bad on my record.</div>

If any of the doctors you work with have to step out of the OR for a moment, in the middle of an operation, or show any other signs of addiction, I want you to let me know. Look for any changes in personality-depression or mood swings -- or tardiness, or missed appointments. I would appreciate it if you would keep this strictly confidential.''</div>
