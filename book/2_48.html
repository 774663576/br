<div class="line_en">"My wallet! Where is it?" were my first words when I found my wallet was missing. I searched my memory for a few good seconds, then realized that I had left my precious wallet at the library. Not only did I leave it at the library, but I had left it in the library's public restroom! I distinctly remembered seeing it on the shelf as I went to the bathroom.</div>

<div class="line_en">This is a story about a learning experience that had a big effect on the way that I live my life. The teacher in the story did not scream, assign homework, give me tests or even grade me on my work. I was taught by one of the most effective methods of teaching, one that only people with lots of love can do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一个让我有所收获的故事，它对我的生活方式产生了巨大的影响。在这个故事中，没有老师的厉声尖叫，没有家庭作业，没有考试，甚至没有功课成绩评定。然而，那却是对我来说最有效的教学方法，只有富有爱心的人才能做到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because the library was now closed, I had to wait until the next morning to begin my search. When I got there the next day, all I found was a sparkling clean restroom, its counters clean and its floors shiny white. This was the first time I could remember ever hating to see a clean bathroom. As I walked out, I looked at myself in the mirror and shook my head at the forgetful fool in front of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图书馆现在已经闭馆了，我只好等到第二天早晨再去找。第二天一到图书馆，我就看到洗手间里干净整洁，洗手台擦得一尘不染，地板反射出亮光。我仍然记得，那是我第一次讨厌看到洗手间这么干净。我走了出去，看着镜子中的自己，对着面前这个健忘的傻瓜摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wondered what I would do if I had found a wallet containing sixty dollars, a phone card and many other irreplaceable personal items. Finally, I painfully accepted the fact that my wallet was gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now all I could hope for was that the person who cleaned the restroom had found my wallet. So I politely approached an old lady reading her book at the front desk. I asked her if a wallet had been found in the bathroom yesterday. She didn't answer me until she found a good place to pull herself away from her book. Then she peered at me from behind the thick black glasses parked on her nose. Letting out a quiet sigh, she slowly struggled out of her comfortable sitting position. She walked through a door and vanishedfor a moment. Then she came back to the desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，我只能寄望于洗手间的清洁工捡到我的钱包了。于是，我向一位坐在前台看书的上了年纪的夫人走去，我表现得很有礼貌。我问她昨天有没有在洗手间捡到了一个钱包。她并没有立即回答我，直到读到一个认为可以中断的地方。接着，她眯着眼睛，从鼻梁上那副厚厚的黑框眼镜后面凝视着我。她轻轻地叹了一口气，缓缓地从舒服的座椅上挣扎下来，走进一个门后不见了。片刻之后，她又回到了前台。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A week later, after I had canceled my bank card and reported my license missing, I received a mysterious package in the mail. Sure enough, it was my wallet! And most amazingly, nothing was missing! But something was different about it. There was a little yellow sheet of paper folded up in one of the wallet pockets that had not been there before. I slowly unfolded the paper. Into my hand fell a little copper medallion of Christ. The letter read something like this:</div>
