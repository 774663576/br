<div class="line_en">Sitting on a deck chair he began to think of the reasons for taking this voyage. Why had his marriage gone wrong? Who was at fault? Why did his wife's lifestyle and his never seem to coincide? He felt bitter and guilty at the same time. The sound of the wind and the harsh whipping of the ship in the rough sea played destruction with his reasoning.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was half dozing off when he looked up and standing in the passage way was a figure clutching an overcoat. He could see by the waving of the long black hair that it was a woman. She dropped down onto a deck chair next to him and said, "Do you mind?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正打着瞌睡，抬起头来，走廊里站着一个人，手里拿着一件大衣。他从那长长的黑发的波动中看出那是个女人。她坐在他旁边的一张躺椅上说：“你介意吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rumble of the ship's engine was too loud and Greg could not get to sleep. He got up and put on an overcoat because he could hear the wind outside, and a walk on the deck was what he needed to calm his nerves. The tossing of the ship caused him to stagger as he went down the passage way to the upper deck. Outside the wind it was fierce and he clung to his lapel to keep his coat from blowing off. The port side of the ship was less windy and Greg found a sheltered passage way amid the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船上引擎的隆隆声太大了，格雷格睡不着觉。他站起身来，穿上一件大衣，因为他能听到外面的风声，他需要在甲板上散步来平复紧张的情绪。船的颠簸使他摇摇晃晃地沿着通道走向上层甲板。外面的风很猛烈，他紧紧抓住衣领，以免外套被风吹掉。船的左舷风较小，格雷格在船中找到了一条避风的通道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mine, too. " she agreed. He cast a glimpse at her face and remembered her sitting alone at dinner, like himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的也是。”她同意了。他瞥了一眼她的脸，想起她像自己一样独自坐在餐桌前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She settled down in the chair and said, "This wind and the rough sea are more than I can take and I just have to get out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在椅子上坐了下来，说：“这风和汹涌的大海让我无法承受，我必须离开这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He said, "No, not at all, be my guest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说：“不，一点也不，请便。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I am, my name is Pearl, isn't this weather terrible?" Greg nodded and clutched his coat tighter. They sat for quite some time, not saying anything. Her thoughts wondered back to home and to her troubles. Her husband was killed in an auto accident and this trip was to ease herself and relieve her sadness. The rough sea and the howling wind didn't help very much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我叫珠儿，这天气不是很糟吗？”格雷格点点头，把他的外套抓得更紧了。他们坐了好一会儿，什么也没说。她的思绪回到家里，回到自己的烦恼。她的丈夫在一场车祸中丧生，这次旅行是为了缓解自己的情绪和减轻她的悲伤。波涛汹涌的大海和呼啸的风并没有多大帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My name's Greg. I noticed you were dining alone. I assume you are sailing by yourself?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我叫格雷格。我注意到你一个人吃饭。我想你是一个人在航行吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then they chatted a bit to pass the time. Greg thought it was a nice relief to have someone to talk to. They both, however, managed to overlook the howling of the wind and the pitching of the ship as they related their tales of misery to each other. There was a natural feeling of attraction between them as they chatted the night away. Just before daybreak, they both dozed off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他们聊了一会儿打发时间。格雷格认为有人可以倾诉是一种很好的解脱。然而，当他们彼此讲述自己痛苦的故事时，却忽略了风的呼啸和船的颠簸。当他们彻夜闲聊时，彼此之间有一种自然的吸引力。就在黎明前，他们都打了个瞌睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know what you mean, I sure hope it doesn't last much longer, my nerves are on edge."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the darkness he heard a woman cry out for help and moved over towards the sound. Reaching out, he seized her by her hair and pulled her up to his side. "Are you all right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在黑暗中，他听到一个女人在呼救，就朝那个声音走去。他伸出手，抓住她的头发，把她拉到身边。“你没事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly the ship lurched. The whole deck tilted and their chairs slid out of the passage way and before they were even conscious of what was happening they were thrown overboard. Greg lost sight of Pearl as he hit the water head first. He could hear the boat's whistle wail out in a frantic cadence. It was pitch dark as he scrambled around in the water, his coat helped him stay afloat. A wave submerged his head and he thought, "This is the end?"He struggled to keep from sinking by grabbing firmly a floating piece of debris of the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然船摇晃了一下。整个甲板倾斜了，他们的椅子滑出了通道，甚至在他们意识到发生了什么之前，他们被扔到了船外。格雷格看不见珍珠，因为他先撞上了水头。他可以听到小船发狂似的鸣笛声。当他在水中挣扎时，漆黑一片，他的外套帮助他漂浮在水面上。一个浪头淹没了他的头，他想，“这就是结局？”他挣扎着抓住船上漂浮的一块碎片以免沉没。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She cried out, "Yes, I'm all right, oh God, thank you. " He could tell by the sound of her voice that it was Pearl. She clung to him for dear life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dawn was breaking and the two lay debilitated on the debris with their limbs soaked in the water. The storm blew over and there was nothing to be seen on the ocean except several pieces of debris floating in the distance. Apparently, no one else survived. Pearl gasped, "They must have been caught in their beds."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="破晓时分，两人的四肢浸泡在水中，躺在岩屑上，身体很虚弱。风暴过去了，除了远处漂浮的几块碎片外，海面上什么也看不见。显然，没有其他人活下来。珠儿喘着气说，“他们一定是在床上被抓住的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A feeling of gloom set in on the two weary survivors and would have devoured them but suddenly Greg caught a sight of an island in the distance. "Look, Pearl, there is an island ahead." They both paddled till their arms ached. After a zealous effort they were able to touch the beach sand beneath their feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个疲惫的幸存者感到一阵阴郁，他们本来是要被吞噬掉的，但是格雷格突然看到了远处的一个小岛。“看，珠儿，前面有个岛。”他们两人一直划到胳膊疼痛为止。经过一番热情的努力，他们终于能够触摸到脚下的沙滩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They hailed with great joy and struggled to the edge of the water. There they fell to their knees, thanking God for their fortune. The two crawled out of the water and laid down in the warm sun to rest themselves from their dreadful experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们欢呼雀跃，挣扎着走到水边。他们跪在地上，感谢上帝赐予他们财富。他们两个从水里爬出来，躺在温暖的阳光下，以结束他们可怕的经历。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a good rest, they got up and toured the little island and found fresh water, and something to eat. Greg managed to break open some coconuts and they used the shells for drinking the heavenly water. Fortunately, the temperature was mild so survival was possible. The only thing they had were the clothes on their backs, their memories of home and the terrible experience they'd been through. They managed to build a lean-to of twigs and palm branches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好好休息之后，他们起身参观了这个小岛，找到了淡水和吃的东西。格雷格设法打开了一些椰子，他们用椰子壳喝天堂的水。幸运的是，温度是温和的，所以存活是可能的。他们唯一拥有的东西就是背上的衣服，他们对家乡的记忆，以及他们所经历的可怕的经历。他们设法用小树枝和棕榈枝建了一个斜坡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They swam by the seashore and spent a lot of their hours making their camp livable. The deserted island became a paradise. But the sharp sound of the ship's whistle plagued their thoughts. It was like the sound of the voice of Satan desperately demanding more hostages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在海边游泳，花了很多时间使他们的营地适合居住。这个荒岛成了一个天堂。但是轮船的汽笛尖锐的声音使他们的思想受到困扰。这就像撒旦绝望地要求更多人质的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last -- the ship's whistle ceased -- it was then Greg realized they were still on the deck of the sinking ship. The small island was nothing but his illusion. The last thing he remembered was he reached out his hand and grabbed a lump of hair and pulled her to his side. "Are you all right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于——船的汽笛声停止了这时格雷格意识到他们还在下沉的船的甲板上。那个小岛只不过是他的幻想。他记得的最后一件事是，他伸出手抓住一团头发，把她拉到身边。“你没事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their thoughts always dwelled on being rescued but they knew it was hopeless, so they did their best to survive. Time passed and somehow they managed to cope with this and a sense of affiliation flourished. In fact without each other, existence would be impossible to imagine. However, the chronic sound of the ship's whistle kept haunting them. The mournful sound was even heard in their sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的思想总是想着被营救，但他们知道这是没有希望的，所以他们尽力生存下去。随着时间的推移，他们设法应付了这种情况，一种归属感蓬勃发展起来。事实上，如果没有彼此，存在将是不可想象的。然而，船上汽笛的慢性声音一直萦绕在他们耳边。甚至在他们的睡梦中也能听到那悲哀的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly a huge wave came and took them under, submerging them deep down into the cold, dark and silent water. They clung to each other in desperation and slowly sank down into the eternal depths.</div>
