<div class="line_en">Michael Corleone and Hector Adonis walked back to the villa and sat under a lemon tree with Peter Clemenza. Michael was eager to read the Testament, but Hector Adonis said that Andolini was due to pick him up for the trip back to Montelepre and Michael waited to see if Andolini had any messages for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis shook his head. "Stefano Andolini has the heart of a murderer, but he is the soul of punctuality. And dependable. I'm afraid that since he is already an hour late, something has gone wrong. And I must be in Montelepre before dark when curfew begins."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯摇了摇头。“斯特凡·安多里尼是杀手，但是他特别守时，是个靠得住的人。我害怕出了什么事情，他已经晚了一个钟头。我必须在天黑宵禁之前返回蒙特莱普雷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter Clemenza went to the door and shouted an order down to one of the woman servants. The woman appeared carrying the kitchen cleaver. She stared into the room for a moment and handed the cleaver to Clemenza. He shut the door to close out her curious eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得·克莱门扎走到门口，喊楼下一个女佣去厨房把斩肉刀拿上来。那女佣上来之后，盯着房间里看了一会儿，然后才把刀递给克莱门扎。他把门关上，不让那个好奇的女人继续往里看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael held the black Madonna on the heavy wooden dresser table. He grasped the disc carved into the bottom with one hand and used his other to clasp the top of the statue's head. Clemenza carefully put the cleaver to the neck of the Madonna, raised his burly arm, and with one quick powerful stroke, chopped off the head and sent it flying across the room. A sheaf of papers bound with a piece of soft gray leather sprouted out of the hollow neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔把黑色圣母雕像放在沉重的木头梳妆台上，一只手抓住嵌在雕像下面的圆形底座，另一只手抓住雕像头的上半部分。克莱门扎小心翼翼地把刀对准雕像的脖子，举起粗壮的手臂，用力猛地一砍，雕像的头被砍下来，滚到了房间的另一侧。从雕像那中空的脖子里露出用灰色软皮包着的一卷纸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael and Peter Clemenza went up to Michael's bedroom. The statue was still in Michael's jacket; he had completely forgotten it. When he took it out, both men stared at the black Virgin Mary. The features were definitely African yet the expression was exactly that of the white Madonnas that decorated almost every poor household in Sicily. Michael turned it over in his hands. It was very heavy -- you could not guess that it was hollow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔和彼得·克莱门扎一起来到迈克尔的卧室，那尊雕像依然在迈克尔的上衣口袋里，他已经把这件事全忘了。他把圣母像拿出来，两个人凝视着它，雕像的特征完全是非洲式的，可是面部表情却跟西西里每个穷人家里供奉着的白人圣母玛利亚像一样。迈克尔用手掂了掂，雕像很重——谁也不会想到它的中间是空的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza had hit exactly on the seam where it had been soldered; the cleaver could never have cut through the hard olive wood. He put the cleaver on the table and pulled the papers out of the headless statue. He loosened the leather thong and spread the papers out on the table. They consisted of one sheaf of about fifteen onionskin pages covered with close handwriting in black ink. The bottom of each page was signed by Guiliano in the careless scrawl of kings. There were also documents with official government seals, letters with government letterheads and statements bearing notary seals. The papers were curling up to resume the shape of their confinement and Michael used the two pieces of the statue and the cleaver to hold them flat on the table. Then he ceremoniously poured two glasses of wine from the jug on the night table and handed one to Clemenza. They drank and then started to read the Testament. It took them almost two hours to finish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎正好一刀砍在接缝上，不然这把刀怎么也砍不断这么硬的橄榄木。他把刀放在梳妆台上，从没有脑袋的雕像中抽出一卷纸。他打开包在上面的软皮，把纸一张张摊开放在梳妆台上。总共有大约十五张极薄的葱皮纸，上面用黑墨水写得密密麻麻的。每一张纸的下面都有吉里安诺龙飞凤舞的签名。里面还有一些盖有官方大印的文件、印有政府部门抬头的信以及盖着公证人印章的文件。由于塞在雕像里的时间太长，这些纸都卷起来了。迈克尔把它们展开弄平，用雕像的身子和头以及那把刀把它们压住。接着他好像要庆祝什么事似的，从床头柜上的坛子里倒了两杯酒，把其中一杯递给克莱门扎。把酒喝完之后，他们就开始看那份遗嘱。他们用了将近两个小时才看完。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael marveled that Turi Guiliano, so young, so idealistic, had lived through these treacheries. Michael knew enough of the world to imagine that Guiliano harbored his own cunning, his own scheme of power, in order to remain dedicated to his mission. Michael was filled with an enormous sense of identification and commitment to the cause of Guiliano's escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔对图里·吉里安诺非常钦佩：年轻的理想主义者遭受了这么多的坎坷。迈克尔了解这个世界，可以想象得出吉里安诺为了致力于自己的使命，掩饰着自己的狡黠和计划。迈克尔对吉里安诺的逃离产生了巨大的认同感和责任感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not so much Guiliano's diary which recounted his history for the past seven years but the documents supporting it that could surely topple the Christian Democratic government in Rome. How could these powerful men have been so foolish, Michael wondered: a note signed by the Cardinal, a letter sent by the Minister of Justice to Don Croce asking what could be done to crush the demonstration at Ginestra, all coyly worded to be sure, but damning in the light of the events that followed. Each thing by itself was innocent enough, brought together they built a mountain of evidence as imposing as the Pyramids.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="能够动摇罗马基督教民主党政府的，不是吉里安诺过去七年写的日记，而是一些证明文件。那些大人物怎么会这么愚蠢？迈克尔心想：有一张红衣主教签署的便条，一封司法部长写给唐·克罗切的信，问他用什么办法可以镇压港吉里斯特拉山口的游行，当然其措辞肯定是遮遮掩掩的，但从后来所发生的事实，就可以看出其中的险恶用心。单看这些事都没有什么问题，可是把它们集中起来，就成了金字塔一样确凿的罪证。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a letter from Prince Ollorto full of flowery compliments to Guiliano and assuring him that all the men in high places of the Christian Democratic government in Rome had assured the Prince that they would do everything in their power to have Guiliano pardoned, providing he did what they had asked of him. In his letter Prince Ollorto claimed he had a complete understanding with the Minister of Justice in Rome.</div>

<div class="line_en">The little man had unloosened his tie and taken off his jacket; his shiny white shirt was dulled with sweat though he was in the shade of a lemon tree. He was also a bit drunk -- the big wine jug on the wooden garden table was empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter Clemenza said, "I'm taking this stuff to Tunis right away. By tomorrow night they'll be in your father's safe."

<div class="line_en">They helped Hector Adonis get into the car and told him not to worry. The Testament would be in America within twenty-four hours and Guiliano would be safe.

<div class="line_en">But Hector Adonis kept muttering, "It will all go badly, it will all go badly," and begged them for transportation.

<div class="line_en">Here by the water there was not the whirring of insects; those creatures needed the lush vegetation, the smoky heated air of the interior. It was almost as if a machine had stopped running. He stood on the beach feeling the peace and beauty of a Sicilian night and he pitied all the others voyaging fearfully in the darkness; Guiliano in his mountains, Pisciotta with the fragile shield of his special red-bordered pass going through enemy lines, Professor Adonis and Stefano Andolini searching for each other on the dusty roads of Sicily, Peter Clemenza riding the blue-black sea to Tunis; and where had Don Domenico Clemenza gone that he had not appeared for dinner? They were all shadows in the Sicilian night, and when they reappeared the stage would be set for the life or death of Turi Guiliano.</div>
