<div class="line_en">The apartment house lobby was empty this time. No gunman waiting under the potted palm to give me orders. I took the automatic elevator up to my floor and walked along the hallway to the tune of a muted radio behind a door. I needed a drink and was in a hurry to get one. I didn't switch the light on inside the door. I made straight for the kitchenette and brought up short in three or four feet. Something was wrong. Something on the air, a scent. The shades were down at the windows and the street light leaking in at the sides made a dim light in the room. I stood still and listened. The scent on the air was a perfume, a heavy cloying perfume.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，公寓楼的大厅是空的。盆栽棕榈树后面并没有拿着枪的人对我发号施令。我坐电梯到了我住的那层，伴着某扇门后面的收音机传出的低柔曲调，在走廊里前行。我需要喝上一杯，迫不及待。进门后我没有打开灯。我直奔厨房，可走到三四英尺开外时我停住了。有什么东西不对劲。空气里的什么东西，某种味道。百叶窗放下着，街上的灯火从窗户两侧漏进来，屋里的光线很昏暗。我静静站着，侧耳细听。空气里的味道是香水味，浓重得令人倒胃口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no sound, no sound at all. Then my eyes adjusted themselves more to the darkness and I saw there was something across the floor in front of me that shouldn't have been there. I backed, reached the wall switch with my thumb and flicked the light on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四下没有声响，全然没有声响。我的眼睛渐渐适应了黑暗，我看到房间另一边，有些原本不应该在那儿的东西出现在我面前。我往后一退，伸出拇指摸向墙上的开关，打开了灯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bed was down. Something in it giggled. A blond head was pressed into my pillow. Two bare arms curved up and the hands belonging to them were clasped on top of the blond head. Carmen Sternwood lay on her back, in my bed, giggling at me. The tawny wave of her hair was spread out on the pillow as if by a careful and artificial hand. Her slaty eyes peered at me and had the effect, as usual, of peering from behind a barrel. She smiled. Her small sharp teeth glinted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="折叠床放下来了。上面有个什么东西在咯咯笑。一颗满头金发的脑袋陷在我的枕头里。两条裸露的胳臂向上屈起，手掌紧扣在那颗金发脑袋的顶上。是卡门·斯特恩伍德仰面躺在我的床上，正朝我咯咯笑。她那一头秀发在我的枕头上铺开棕色的波浪，宛若出自能工巧匠的设计。她蓝灰色的眼眸凝视着我，跟往常一样，还是让人感觉那目光是从照相机镜头后面射出来的。她笑了。她又小又尖的牙齿闪着光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went over to a floor lamp and pulled the switch, went back to put off the ceiling light, and went across the room again to the chessboard on a card table under the lamp. There was a problem laid out on the board, a six-mover. I couldn't solve it, like a lot of my problems. I reached down and moved a knight, then pulled my hat and coat off and threw them somewhere. All this time the soft giggling went on from the bed, that sound that made me think of rats behind a wainscoting in an old house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到落地灯前，按下了开关，回到原处关掉顶灯，重新穿过房间，走到牌桌前看着台灯下的那盘象棋。棋盘上是个困局，只能走六步。就像生活中的许多困局，这棋局我解不开。我落手拿起一个“马”走了一步，随后扯下帽子脱下外套，随便一丢。在此期间，床上的轻柔笑声始终没停，那声音让我想起一所老宅墙板后面老鼠的窸窣声响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I dug a cigarette out and looked at her with bleak eyes. "I bet I can. You came through the keyhole, just like Peter Pan."</div>

<div class="line_en">"By God," I said, "it was right at the back of my mind. I was groping for it. I almost had it, when you spoke. In another minute I'd have said 'I bet you're all undressed.' I always wear my rubbers in bed myself, in case I wake up with a bad conscience and have to sneak away from it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老天作证，”我说，“话已经到嘴边了。我正在想该怎么开口呢。我差点就说了，你快了一步。但凡慢上一分钟，我准会先说：‘你肯定啥也没穿。’我可总是穿着橡胶鞋睡觉，生怕醒过来良心难安，得赶紧开溜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm all undressed," she said, after I had smoked and stared at her for a minute.</div>

<div class="line_en">I pulled a shred of tobacco off the edge of my lower lip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我揪掉残留在下唇边缘的几片烟草。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The manager let me in. I showed him your card. I'd stolen it from Vivian. I told him you told me to come here and wait for you. I was -- I was mysterious." She glowed with delight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“楼管放我进来的。我给他看了你的名片。我从维维安那儿偷的。我对他说，你叫我来这儿等你。我——我神出鬼没。”她的脸上泛出喜悦的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're cute." She rolled her head a little, kittenishly. Then she took her left hand from under her head and took hold of the covers, paused dramatically, and swept them aside. She was undressed all right. She lay there on the bed in the lamplight, as naked and glistening as a pearl. The Sternwood girls were giving me both barrels that night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你很可爱。”她搔首弄姿地稍微转了转脑袋。接着她从后脑勺下面抽出左手，抓住被子，煞有介事地停顿片刻，掀了开来。她确实啥也没穿。她躺在床上，在灯光照映下，赤裸、闪亮得犹如一颗珍珠。那天晚上，斯特恩伍德家的两位千金都想对我献身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She giggled some more and covered herself up again. "Well, how did you get in?" I asked her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又傻笑了几声，重新盖上被子。“嗯，你是怎么进来的？”我问她。">查看中文翻译</div>

Doghouse Reilly never let a pal down that way. I'm your friend. I won't let you down -- in spite of yourself. You and I have to keep on being friends, and this isn't the way to do it. Now will you dress like a nice little girl?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”我用手里的烟指着她，“别再叫我帮你穿衣服了。我累了。我对你奉献给我的一切都很感激。就是我无福消受。道格豪斯·赖利从来不会像这样让朋友失望。我是你的朋友。我不想让你失望——不管你自己怎么想。你我之间必须保持朋友关系，不该干那事儿。现在你可以做个乖丫头，穿好衣服了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She giggled. "Not going -- not for a long time… I like it here. You're cute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她咯咯笑着。“不出去——想待上很久…我喜欢这里。你很可爱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It isn't on account of the neighbors," I told her. "They don't really care a lot. There's a lot of stray broads in any apartment house and one more won't make the building rock. It's a question of professional pride. You know -- professional pride. I'm working for your father. He's a sick man, very frail, very helpless. He sort of trusts me not to pull any stunts. Won't you please get dressed, Carmen?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是怕邻居看见，”我对她说，“他们无所谓的。随便哪栋公寓楼里都有不少野鸡，多一个，房子也不会塌了。这关乎职业的尊严。知道吧——职业的尊严。我为你父亲工作。他病了，弱不经风，孤苦无助。他挺信任我，觉得我不会耍花招。请你穿上衣服好吗，卡门？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked down at the chessboard. The move with the knight was wrong. I put it back where I had moved it from. Knights had no meaning in this game. It wasn't a game for knights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我低头看着棋盘。马的那步走错了。我把那颗棋子放回原位。马在这局棋里毫无价值。这不是属于马的一局棋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked at her again. She lay still now, her face pale against the pillow, her eyes large and dark and empty as rain barrels in a drought. One of her small five-fingered thumbless hands picked at the cover restlessly. There was a vague glimmer of doubt starting to get born in her somewhere. She didn't know about it yet. It's so hard for women -- even nice women -- to realize that their bodies are not irresistible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又看了看她。眼下她静静躺着，苍白的面颊贴着枕头，眼睛又大又黑，却空洞得犹如旱灾时的雨水桶。她的手掌虽然五指俱全，大拇指却被啃得不成了样子——她正用一只手烦躁地揪着被子。她的心里渐渐隐约生出几丝狐疑。她还没明白过来。要让女人——哪怕是讨人喜欢的女人——懂得她们的身体并非不可抗拒，实在是太难了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you're dressed when I get back, you'll get the drink. Okey?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我回来时你穿好衣服了，就有喝的。行吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Uh-huh." Dark silent mystified eyes stared at me solemnly, the doubt growing larger in them, creeping into them noiselessly, like a cat in long grass stalking a young blackbird.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯嗯！”那双困惑、无言的深色眼睛认真地盯着我，狐疑就像一只躲在高高草丛里追踪鹩哥的猫，悄然潜入她的眼中，益发加重了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我说：“我去厨房调杯喝的。要来一杯吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her teeth parted and a faint hissing noise came out of her mouth. She didn't answer me. I went out to the kitchenette and got out some Scotch and fizzwater and mixed a couple of highballs. I didn't have anything really exciting to drink, like nitroglycerin or distilled tiger's breath. She hadn't moved when I got back with the glasses. The hissing had stopped. Her eyes were dead again. Her lips started to smile at me. Then she sat up suddenly and threw all the covers off her body and reached.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她分开牙齿，一阵微弱的嘶嘶声从她嘴里发了出来。她没有回答我。我去小厨房里拿了点威士忌和气泡水，调了两份高杯酒[1]。我这儿没有“硝化甘油”或者“蒸馏的老虎气息”那类真正刺激的东西可以喝。我拿着酒杯回来时她还是没动。嘶嘶声停了。她的眼神又了无生气了。她的嘴开始对我露出笑容。接着她突然坐了起来，把身上的被褥掀得一干二净，伸出手。【注：[1]Highball：用威士忌或白兰地等烈酒掺水或汽水加冰块制成的饮料，盛在高玻璃杯内饮用。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then her lips moved very slowly and carefully, as if they were artificial lips and had to be manipulated with springs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，她的嘴唇动了，非常缓慢而小心，仿佛那是两片人造嘴唇，得靠弹簧操控。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I put the two glasses down on the card table and sat down myself and lit another cigarette. "Go ahead. I won't watch you."</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't mind that. I didn't mind what she called me, what anybody called me. But this was the room I had to live in. It was all I had in the way of a home. In it was everything that was mine, that had any association for me, any past, anything that took the place of a family. Not much; a few books, pictures, radio, chessmen, old letters, stuff like that. Nothing. Such as they were they had all my memories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不在乎。她叫我什么，随便谁叫我什么，我都不在乎。但这屋子我总得住。我只有这么一个可以称之为“家”的地方。这屋里有属于我、能勾起我思绪的一切，所有过往，所有聊以代替一个家庭的东西。不多；一些书、照片、收音机、棋子、旧信件，诸如此类。没了。可它们装着我所有的回忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked away. Then I was aware of the hissing noise very sudden and sharp. It startled me into looking at her again. She sat there naked, propped on her hands, her mouth open a little, her face like scraped bone. The hissing noise came tearing out of her mouth as if she had nothing to do with it. There was something behind her eyes, blank as they were, that I had never seen in a woman's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转过头去。这时我听见那嘶嘶声又来了，非常急促、刺耳。我吃了一惊，赶紧重新向她望去。她赤条条坐在那儿，两手撑着床，嘴巴张开了一点，她的脸犹如剔净了肉的白骨。那嘶嘶声从她的嘴里喷涌而出，仿佛跟她毫无干系。她的眼神虽然空洞，但背后隐藏着某种东西，是我从未在女人眼里看到过的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stood there beside the bed, holding a green bag tight against a fur-trimmed coat. She wore a rakish green hat crooked on her head. She stood there for a moment and hissed at me, her face still like scraped bone, her eyes still empty and yet full of some jungle emotion. Then she walked quickly to the door and opened it and went out, without speaking, without looking back. I heard the elevator lurch into motion and move in the shaft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站在床边，手里的绿色提包紧贴着一件毛边镶边的外套。她的头上歪戴着一顶潇洒不羁的绿帽子。她站了片刻，朝我嘶嘶吐气，她的脸依旧像是剔净了肉的白骨，她的眼睛依旧空洞，却充盈着某种狂野的情绪。她快步走向门口，打开门出去了，没有说话，也没有回头看。我听到电梯摇晃着动了起来，在电梯井里滑行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said carefully: "I'll give you three minutes to get dressed and out of here. If you're not out by then, I'll throw you out -- by force. Just the way you are, naked. And I'll throw your clothes after you into the hall. Now -- get started."</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked to the windows and pulled the shades up and opened the windows wide. The night air came drifting in with a kind of stale sweetness that still remembered automobile exhausts and the streets of the city. I reached for my drink and drank it slowly. The apartment house door closed itself down below me. Steps tinkled on the quiet sidewalk. A car started up not far away. It rushed off into the night with a rough clashing of gears. I went back to the bed and looked down at it. The imprint of her head was still in the pillow, of her small corrupt body still on the sheets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到窗前，拉起百叶窗帘，把窗子敞开。夜晚的空气飘进来，那股污浊的甜腻里依然滞留着汽车尾气和城市街道的味道。我伸手取来酒，慢慢喝着。楼底下的公寓大门自动关上了。静谧的人行道上传来“哒哒”的脚步声。不远处有辆车发动了。随着齿轮粗粝的撞击声，车子飞快驶入了夜色中。我回到床前，低头看着它。枕头上仍然留有她脑袋的印记，被单上的压痕则依稀现出她那具小小的邪恶躯体。">查看中文翻译</div>
