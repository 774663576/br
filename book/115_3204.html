<div class="line_en">There would be other people touching his shoulder, and touching mine, but we would not see them. Nor would we speak or call to one another, for the wind and the distance would carry away the sound of our voices. But I should see his eyes and he would see mine before the ship drew away from the side of the quay. Favell, Mrs Danvers, Colonel Julyan, Frank with the slip of paper in his hands, they were all forgotten at this moment. It was ours, inviolate, a fraction of time suspended between two seconds. And then he turned away and held out his hand to Frank. "Well done," he said. "What's the address?"</div>

We only had Doctor Phillips from Kerrith here once, that time she sprained her wrist. I've never heard her speak of this Doctor Baker, she never mentioned his name to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹弗斯太太摇摇头。“德温特夫人从来不需要请大夫看病。她跟所有身强力壮的人一样瞧不起大夫。只有一回，我们把菲力普斯大夫从克里斯请来出诊，那次她把手腕于扭伤了。我从来没听她说起过这个贝克大夫。她从来没在我面前提到过这个名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Frank. "I think you're wrong there. Baker wasn't a quack. The night porter at Museum 0488 told me he was a very well-known woman's specialist."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I tell you the fellow was a face-cream mixer," said Favell. "What the hell does it matter who he was? If there was anything to it Danny would know. I tell you it's some fool fellow who had discovered a new way of bleaching the hair or whitening the skin, and Rebecca had probably got the address from her hairdresser that morning and went along after lunch out of curiosity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以打包票，准是个卖雪花膏的江湖术士，”费弗尔说。“其实管他是干什么的，这根本无关紧要。要是真有什么，丹尼不会不知道的。我说呀，准是个什么无聊角色，搞出了一套新的美容术，什么可以把头发集成谈颜色呀，或者使皮肤变白呀，而那天早上吕蓓卡很可能从理发师那儿弄到了地址，出于好奇，饭后就去找他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She was too thin," said Favell. "I told her about it, but she only laughed. Said it suited her. Banting I suppose, like all these women. Perhaps she went to this chap Baker for a diet sheet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她太瘦了，”费弗尔说。“我对她这么说过，她只是付之一笑，说这对她正合适。说不定她也跟所有的女人一样，搞什么减肥疗法吧。说不定她上贝克这家伙那儿去是要他开张饮食单吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's true," said Favell slowly. "We were forgetting the note." Once more he pulled it out of his pocket and read it to us aloud."I've got something to tell you, and I want to see you as soon as possible. Rebecca."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点不错，”费弗尔不慌不忙地说。“我们把这张便条给忘了。”他又从口袋里掏出纸条，大声念给在场的人听：“我有事相告，要及早见你一面。吕蓓卡上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="丹弗斯太太沉吟着摇摇头。她神情迷惘，这会儿突然冒出个贝克，像是把她同糊涂了。“我不明白，”她说。“我不知道是怎么回事。贝克，一个叫贝克的大夫。她为什么不告诉我呢？为什么要瞒着我？她什么事情都对我说的呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth screamed in their faces and they did not see. They all stood there, staring at one another, and they did not understand. I dared not look at them. I dared not move lest I betray my knowledge. Maxim said nothing. He had gone back to the window and was looking out into the garden that was hushed and dark and still. The rain had ceased at last, but the spots fell from the dripping leaves and from the gutter above the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情的真相正冲着他们大声尖叫，可是他们看不见。他们一个个站在那儿，你看着我，我看着你，不明白是怎么回事。我不敢朝他们望一眼，也不敢动弹一下，生怕在出什么马脚，让别人看出我明白事情的底细。迈克西姆一声不吭。他又走回到窗口，此时正望着外面的花园。花园里黑洞洞的，一片沉寂。雨终于止了，但雨水还是顺着湿淋淋的树叶，沿着窗子上方的檐槽，淅淅沥沥地往下滴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It ought to be quite easy to verify," said Frank. "Here is the doctor's present address. I can write him a letter and ask him if he remembers an appointment last year with Mrs de Winter."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I believe you're right after all," said Favell. "The note and that appointment seem to hang together. But what the hell was it all about, that's what I want to know? What was the matter with her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你这句话总算说对啦，”费弗尔说。“这张纸条和那次约会似乎对得起口径。可到底是怎么回事？这才是我想知道的呢。她到底出了什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know if he would take any notice of it," said Colonel Julyan, "there is so much of this etiquette in the medical profession. Every case is confidential, you know.

<div class="line_en">I saw Mrs Danvers look sharply from Favell to Maxim, and I realized then, for the first time, that Mrs Danvers had not known about Favell's accusation. At last she was beginning to understand. I could tell from the expression on her face. There was doubt written on it, then wonder and hatred mixed, and then conviction. Once again those lean long hands of hers clutched convulsively at her dress, and she passed her tongue over her lips. She went on staring at Maxim. She never took her eyes away from Maxim. It's too late, I thought, she can't do anything to us now, the harm is done. It does not matter what she says to us now, or what she does. The harm is done. She can't hurt us any more. Maxim did not notice her, or if he did he gave no sign. He was talking to Colonel Julyan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看见丹弗斯太太的目光猛地从费弗尔身上移开，转到迈克西姆脸上，到这时候我才恍然省悟，丹弗斯太太原先并不知道费弗尔提出的指控。这时，她终于开始领会了。这可以从她的脸部表情上看出来：先是大惑不解，接着是惊奇之中夹杂着仇恨，再后来便是确信无疑了——这一切都明明白白缕刻在她脸上。她那又瘦又长的双手又抽搐着抓住裙子；她还伸出舌头舔舔嘴唇。她的目光死死地盯着迈克西姆，再也不曾移开。我心想，反正事情已经闹到这步田地，厄运已经落在我们头上，她再也不能拿我们怎么了。现在，不管她对我们说什么，干什么，都没什么关系了。倒霉事情已成定局，她再也伤害不着我们啦。迈克西姆没注意到她的神色，要不就是注意到了而不露声色。此时他在跟朱利安上校说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anything for time, eh?" said Favell; "a lot can be done in twenty-four hours, can't it? Trains can be caught, ships can sail, aeroplanes can fly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要想法子拖延点时间，对吗？”费弗尔说。“拖延二十四小时就大有回旋余地了，是吗？可以赶火车，搭轮船，乘飞机？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If only Mrs Danvers would take her eyes away from Maxim. Frank had seen her now. He was watching her, puzzled, anxious. I saw him glance once more at the slip of paper in his hands, on which he had written Doctor Baker's address. Then he too glanced at Maxim. I believe then that-some faint idea of the truth began to force itself to his conscience, for he went very white and put the paper down on the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但愿丹弗斯太太别这么死盯着迈克西姆。弗兰克这会儿也注意到她了。他望着她，既感到迷惑不解，又显得焦急不安。我看见他又朝手里那张写着贝克大夫住址的纸条看了看，接着膘了迈克西姆一眼。我相信他对事情的真相已开始有所察觉，而且隐隐感到问心有愧，因为他的脸色突然变得惨白，把手里的纸条往桌上一放。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think there is any necessity to bring Inspector Welch into the affair -- yet," said Colonel Julyan. His voice was different, harder. I did not like the way he used the word "yet". Why must he use it at all? I did not like it. "If I go with de Winter, and stay with him the whole time, and bring him back, will that satisfy you?" he said.</div>
