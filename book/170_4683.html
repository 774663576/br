<div class="line_en">There was a time when he might have taken this dismissal as a blot upon his honor. But that was in Westeros. In the viper's pit that was Meereen, honor seemed as silly as a fool's motley. And this mistrust was mutual. Hizdahr zo Loraq might be his queen's consort, but he would never be his king. "If His Grace wishes for me to remove myself from court…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps that was why he was being put aside. One by one, Hizdahr removes us all. Strong Belwas lingered at the door of death in the temple, under the care of the Blue Graces… though Selmy half suspected they were finishing the job those honeyed locusts had begun. Skahaz Shavepate had been stripped of his command. The Unsullied had withdrawn to their barracks. Jhogo, Daario Naharis, Admiral Groleo, and Hero of the Unsullied remained hostages of the Yunkai'i. Aggo and Rakharo and the rest of the queen's khalasar had been dispatched across the river to search for their lost queen. Even Missandei had been replaced; the king did not think it fit to use a child as his herald, and a onetime Naathi slave at that. And now me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pit fighters all. Ser Barristan was unsurprised. Hizdahr zo Loraq sat uneasily on his new throne. It had been a thousand years since Meereen last had a king, and there were some even amongst the old blood who thought they might have made a better choice than him. Outside the city sat the Yunkai'i with their sellswords and their allies; inside were the Sons of the Harpy.</div>

<div class="line_en">He has that much sense, at least. Belaquo Bonebreaker and Goghor the Giant might serve as Hizdahr's shields, but the notion of either leading an army into battle was so ludicrous that the old knight almost smiled. "I am His Grace's to command."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他至少还有这点判断力。碎骨者贝拉寇和巨人高古尔可以作为希兹达赫的护卫，但想到他们带领着军队作战的滑稽模样，老骑士差点笑了出来。“我遵从陛下的命令。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the king's protectors grew fewer every day. Hizdahr's blunder with Grey Worm had cost him the Unsullied. When His Grace had tried to put them under the command of a cousin, as he had the Brazen Beasts, Grey Worm had informed the king that they were free men who took commands only from their mother. As for the Brazen Beasts, half were freed-men and the rest shavepates, whose true loyalty might still be to Skahaz mo Kandaq. The pit fighters were King Hizdahr's only reliable support, against a sea of enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="况且国王的保卫者也日益减少。希兹达赫对灰虫子的所为令他失去了无垢者。国王曾试图将他们安排在他掌管铜面兽的堂弟麾下，可灰虫子告诉国王说他们是自由人，只听从龙母的差遣。至于铜面兽，一半是自由人，其余的则是剃顶之人，后者仍然忠于斯卡哈兹·莫·坎达克。这些深坑斗士是希兹达赫国王仅存的可信赖的拥护者，来对抗浩瀚如海的敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Great Pyramid of Meereen was eight hundred feet high from base to point. The seneschal's chambers were on the second level. The queen's apartments, and his own, occupied the highest step. A long climb for a man my age, Ser Barristan thought, as he started up. He had been known to make that climb five or six times a day on the queen's business, as the aches in his knees and the small of his back could attest. There will come a day when I can no longer face these steps, he thought, and that day will be here sooner than I would like. Before it came, he must make certain that at least a few of his lads were ready to take his place at the queen's side. I will knight them myself when they are worthy, and give them each a horse and golden spurs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The royal apartments were still and silent. Hizdahr had not taken up residence there, preferring to establish his own suite of rooms deep in the heart of the Great Pyramid, where massive brick walls surrounded him on all sides. Mezzara, Miklaz, Qezza, and the rest of the queen's young cupbearers -- hostages in truth, but both Selmy and the queen had become so fond of them that it was hard for him to think of them that way -- had gone with the king, whilst Irri and Jhiqui departed with the other Dothraki. Only Missandei remained, a forlorn little ghost haunting the queen's chambers at the apex of the pyramid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王室的寝宫寂静无声。希兹达赫还没开始在这里居住，他更愿意把自己安置在位于大金字塔中央属于他自己的套房里，那里有厚重的砖墙从四周环绕着他。梅扎拉，米克拉兹，奎扎，还有其他女王的年轻侍酒——她们虽然只是人质，但赛尔弥和女王都开始喜爱上她们了，尽管对他来说很难从那个方向上去想她们——也已跟随国王离开了。伊丽和姬琪与其他多拉斯克人死在了一起。只有弥桑黛活了下来，一个被遗弃的小幽灵在金字塔尖女王的房间里游荡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Barristan walked out onto the terrace. The sky above Meereen was the color of corpse flesh, dull and white and heavy, a mass of unbroken cloud from horizon to horizon. The sun was hidden behind a wall of cloud. It would set unseen, as it had risen unseen that morning. The night would be hot, a sweaty, suffocating, sticky sort of night without a breath of air. For three days rain had threatened, but not a drop had fallen. Rain would come as a relief. It might help wash the city clean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴利斯坦爵士登上露台。弥林上方天空的颜色像是尸肉，灰暗、苍白而又阴沉，大片的乌云从一侧的地平线延续到另一侧。太阳被隐藏在云墙之后。它会在不知不觉中落山，就像早上也没有人看到它升起。这里的夜晚相当闷热，那是一种让人窒息，多汗，浑身黏腻而又没有一丝风的夜晚。这三天的天气预示着降雨，但还没有一滴雨落下。雨水将会成为一种救赎。它能将这座城市清洗干净。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The slavers will find some way to blame Daenerys for that as well, Ser Barristan thought bitterly. He could almost hear them whispering -- Great Masters, Sons of the Harpy, Yunkai'i, all telling one another that his queen was dead. Half of the city believed it, though as yet they did not have the courage to say such words aloud. But soon, I think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些奴隶为此总会用某种方式来责怪丹妮丝莉，巴利斯坦爵士苦涩地想。他几乎可以听到他们的耳语——那些伟主大人们，鹰身女妖之子和渊凯人正在一个个地传言——他的女王死了。城市里有一半人相信这句话，尽管目前他们还不敢大声说出来。可我想很快就会了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From here he could see four lesser pyramids, the city's western walls, and the camps of the Yunkishmen by the shores of Slaver's Bay, where a thick column of greasy smoke twisted upward like some monstrous serpent. The Yunkishmen burning their dead, he realized. The pale mare is galloping through their siege camps. Despite all the queen had done, the sickness had spread, both within the city walls and without. Meereen's markets were closed, its streets empty. King Hizdahr had allowed the fighting pits to remain open, but the crowds were sparse. The Meereenese had even begun to shun the Temple of the Graces, reportedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从这里能够看到四座小金字塔，城市西侧的城墙，还有位于奴隶湾的渊凯人营地，一道浓重油腻的柱状烟雾从那里滚滚升起，就像是一条畸形的蛇。渊凯人在焚烧死者，他意识到。苍白母马在他们的帐篷之间飞驰。尽管女王都做了一切能做的事情，但疾病还是已经开始蔓延，无论在城墙内外。弥林的市场被关闭，街道上空空如也。希兹达赫国王允许角斗深坑保持开放，观众却很稀少。传闻弥林人甚至已经开始回避圣恩神庙。">查看中文翻译</div>

Of late, whenever he knelt to drink from a still pool, he saw a stranger's face gazing up from the water's depths. When had those crow's-feet first appeared around his pale blue eyes?

<div class="line_en">Not for the first time, Selmy wondered at the strange fates that had brought him here. He was a knight of Westeros, a man of the stormlands and the Dornish marches; his place was in the Seven Kingdoms, not here upon the sweltering shores of Slaver's Bay. I came to bring Daenerys home. Yet he had lost her, just as he had lost her father and her brother. Even Robert. I failed him too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet it seemed like only yesterday that he had been raised to knighthood, after the tourney at King's Landing. He could still recall the touch of King Aegon's sword upon his shoulder, light as a maiden's kiss. His words had caught in his throat when he spoke his vows. At the feast that night he had eaten ribs of wild boar, prepared the Dornish way with dragon peppers, so hot they burned his mouth. Forty-seven years, and the taste still lingered in his memory, yet he could not have said what he had supped on ten days ago if all seven kingdoms had depended on it. Boiled dog, most like. Or some other foul dish that tasted no better.</div>

Instead he had stood befuddled as she leapt into the pit, shouting her name, then running uselessly after her across the scarlet sands. I am become old and slow. Small wonder Naharis mocked him as Ser Grandfather. Would Daario have moved more quickly if he had been beside the queen that day?

He had seen things that it pained him to recall, and more than once he wondered how much of the blood was on his own hands. If he had not gone into Duskendale to rescue Aerys from Lord Darklyn's dungeons, the king might well have died there as Tywin Lannister sacked the town. Then Prince Rhaegar would have ascended the Iron Throne, mayhaps to heal the realm. Duskendale had been his finest hour, yet the memory tasted bitter on his tongue.</div>

Strictly speaking, it was purely the king's choice whether or not to extend Kingsguard protection to others, even those of royal blood. Some kings thought it right and proper to dispatch Kingsguard to serve and defend their wives and children, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins of greater and lesser degree, and occasionally even their lovers, mistresses, and bastards.

Skahaz moved closer. "That was before. The pit changed all. Daenerys gone, Yurkhaz dead. In place of one old lion, a pack of jackals. Bloodbeard… that one has no taste for peace. And there is more. Worse. Volantis has launched its fleet against us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"To what end?" He is speaking treason. Conspiracy. "Life." The Shavepate's eyes were black pools behind the brazen cat mask. "We must strike before the Volantenes arrive. Break the siege, kill the slaver lords, turn their sellswords. The Yunkai'i do not expect an attack. I have spies in their camps. There's sickness, they say, worse every day. Discipline has gone to rot. The lords are drunk more oft than not, gorging themselves at feasts, telling each other of the riches they'll divide when Meereen falls, squabbling over primacy. Bloodbeard and the Tattered Prince despise each other. No one expects a fight. Not now. Hizdahr's peace has lulled us to sleep, they believe."</div>
