<div class="line_en">As I say, up till the Monday evening, my narrative might have been that of Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock. But after Monday our ways diverged. Poirot was busy on his own account. I got to hear of what he was doing, because in King's Abbot, you get to hear of everything, but he did not take me into his confidence beforehand. And I, too, had my own preoccupations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚才说过，直到星期一晚上，我所记叙的案情始末可以替换为波洛本人的视角，他是福尔摩斯，我是他身边的华生。但过了星期一我们便分头行动，波洛自己忙自己的。他的行动我也屡有耳闻，因为在金斯艾伯特，任何风吹草动都会传得人尽皆知。但他不再事先通知我要做什么，何况我也有事要办。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the evening talk I have just chronicled, the affair seemed to me to enter on a different phase. The whole thing can be divided into two parts, each clear and distinct from the other. Part I ranges from Ackroyd's death on the Friday evening to the following Monday night. It is the straightforward narrative of what occurred, as presented to Hercule Poirot. I was at Poirot's elbow the whole time. I saw what he saw. I tried my best to read his mind. As I know now, I failed in this latter task. Though Poirot showed me all his discoveries -- as, for instance, the gold wedding-ring -- he held back the vital and yet logical impressions that he formed. As I came to know later, this secrecy was characteristic of him. He would throw out hints and suggestions, but beyond that he would not go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过我记录下来的上述这场夜谈，案情在我眼中似乎进入了全新的阶段。案件经过可以一分为二，非常清楚，界限分明。前半部分从星期五晚上艾克罗伊德之死到第二周的星期一晚上。我对这个阶段的记录完全平铺直叙，与赫尔克里·波洛的所见所闻一致。我一直紧随波洛，所见所闻与他不差分毫，并且竭尽所能揣摩他的心思——不过现在看来我是白费力气了。虽然波洛不吝与我分享他的发现——比如那个订婚戒指——但他所重视的关键信息和由此形成的逻辑推论却从未说出口。后来我才知道他这人一贯口风很紧，也许会抛出一些暗示与建议，但也仅限于此了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning. There was, for instance, the question of the black boots. But that comes later… To take things strictly in chronological order, I must begin with the summons from Mrs Ackroyd.</div>

<div class="line_en">On looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal character of this period. Everyone had a hand in the elucidation of the mystery. It was rather like a jigsaw puzzle to which everyone contributed their own little piece of knowledge or discovery. But their task ended there. To Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those pieces into their correct place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今回想起来，令我印象最深的是，那段时间可谓千头万绪，错综复杂。每个人对谋杀案都有自己的看法，好比玩拼图游戏，人人都能贡献一点小智慧或小发现。但他们无法更进一步，唯有波洛才能将无数碎片归整拼成图形的全貌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No one can say that I have failed in my duty," continued Mrs Ackroyd. "I am sure Inspector Raglan is perfectly satisfied. Why should this little upstart of a foreigner make a fuss? A most ridiculous-looking creature he is too -- just like a comic Frenchman in a revue. I can't think why Flora insisted on bringing him into the case. She never said a word to me about it. Just went off and did it on her own. Flora is too independent. I am a woman of the world and her mother. She should have come to me for advice first."</div>

<div class="line_en">I was shrewd enough to see that a very real anxiety lay behind these outpourings. Poirot had been justified in his premises.

<div class="line_cn" title="通过她滔滔不绝的诉说，我敏锐地捕捉到潜藏在背后的阵阵焦虑。波洛的假设果然没错，昨天围坐一桌的六个人之中，至少艾克罗伊德太太确实隐瞒了一些事。现在就轮到我来掀开她的底牌了。">查看中文翻译</div>

But I didn't like the way she looked -- quite respectful in manner, but a very nasty light in her eyes. Almost contemptuous, if you know what I mean. I never have liked that girl very much. She's a good servant, and she says Ma'am, and doesn't object to wearing caps and aprons (which I declare to you a lot of them do nowadays), and she can say "Not at home" without scruples if she has to answer the door instead of Parker, and she doesn't have those peculiar gurgling noises inside which so many parlourmaids seem to have when they wait at table Let me see, where was I?"</div>
