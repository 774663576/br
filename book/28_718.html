<div class="line_en">My father's younger siblings were there. My mother's family turned out in its entirety. I had old school friends and neighbors who came, people from Princeton, people from Whitney Young. Mrs. Smith, the wife of my high school assistant principal who still lived down the street from us on Euclid Avenue, helped organize the wedding, while our across-the-street neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and their jazz band played later that day at our reception. Santita Jackson, ebullient in a black dress with a plunging neckline, was my maid of honor. I'd invited old colleagues from Sidley and new colleagues from city hall. The law partners from Barack's firm were there, as were his old organizer friends. Barack's rowdy Hawaiian high school guy posse mingled happily with a handful of his Kenyan relatives, who wore brightly colored East African hats. Sadly, we'd lost Gramps -- Barack's grandfather -- the previous winter to cancer, but his mother and grandmother had made the trip to Chicago, as had Auma and Maya, half sisters from different continents, united in their affection for Barack. It was the first time our two families had met, and the feeling was joyful.</div>

It was a big wedding, and big was how it needed to be. If we were having the wedding in Chicago, there was no trimming the guest list. My roots went too deep. I had not just cousins but also cousins of cousins, and those cousins of cousins had kids, none of whom I'd ever leave out and all of whom made the day more meaningful and merry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack had woken up that morning with a nasty head cold, but it had miraculously cleared as soon as he arrived at the church. He was now smiling at me, bright-eyed, from his place at the altar, dressed in a rented tux and a buffed pair of new shoes. Marriage was still more mysterious to him than it was to me, but in the fourteen months we'd been engaged, he'd been nothing but all in. We'd chosen everything about this day carefully. Barack, having initially declared he was not interested in wedding minutiae, had ended up lovingly, assertively -- and predictably -- inserting his opinion into everything from the flower arrangements to the canapés that would get served at the South Shore Cultural Center in another hour or so. We'd picked our wedding song, which Santita would sing with her stunning voice, accompanied by a pianist.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were surrounded by love -- the eclectic, multicultural Obama kind and the anchoring Robinsons-from-the-South-Side kind, all of it now interwoven visibly, pew to pew, inside the church. I held tightly to Craig's elbow as he walked me down the aisle. As we reached the front, I caught my mother's gaze. She was sitting in the first row, looking regal in a floor-length black-and-white sequined dress we'd picked out together, her chin lifted and her eyes proud. We still ached for my father every day, though as he would've wanted, we were also continuing on.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was nine years old at the time. I knew nothing about love and commitment or conquering the world. All I could do was conjure for myself shimmery ideas about what love might be like and who might come along someday to make me feel that strong. Would it be Michael Jackson? José Cardenal from the Cubs? Someone like my dad? I couldn't even begin to imagine him, really, the person who would become the "you" to my "I."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a Stevie Wonder tune called "You and I (We Can Conquer the World)." I'd first heard it as a kid, in third or fourth grade, when Southside gave me the Talking Book album as a gift -- my first record album, utterly precious to me. I kept it at his house and was allowed to play it anytime I came to visit. He'd taught me how to care for the vinyl, how to wipe the record's grooves clean of dust, how to lift the needle from the turntable and set it down delicately in the right spot. Usually he'd left me alone with the music, making himself scarce so that I could learn, in privacy, everything that album had to teach, mostly by belting out the lyrics again and again with my little-girl lungs. Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world / In love you and I, you and I, you and I…</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever was out there, we'd step into it together. I'd poured myself into planning this day, the elegance of the entire affair had somehow mattered to me, but I understood now that what really mattered, what I'd remember forever, was the grip. It settled me like nothing else ever had. I had faith in this union, faith in this man. To declare it was the easiest thing in the world. Looking at Barack's face, I knew for sure that he felt the same. Neither one of us cried that day. Nobody's voice quavered. If anything, we were a little giddy. From here, we'd gather up all several hundred of our witnesses and roll on over to the reception. We'd eat and drink and dance until we'd exhausted ourselves with our joy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Trinity Church had a dynamic and soulful reputation. Barack had first started going there during his days as an organizer, and more recently the two of us had formally become members, following the lead of many of our young, professional African American friends in town. The church's pastor, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, was known as a sensational preacher with a passion for social justice and was now officiating at our wedding. He welcomed our friends and family and then held up our wedding bands for all to see. He spoke eloquently of what it meant to form a union and have it witnessed by a caring community, these people who collectively knew every dimension of Barack and every dimension of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三一教堂充满活力，注重精神交流。贝拉克早在做社区组织者时就开始到这里来，后来，我们在城里许多年轻的黑人朋友的引领下（多为职场人士），正式成为它的一员。教堂的牧师是耶利米·莱特，他是一位热心社会正义且极富感染力的传道者，为我们主持婚礼的正是他。他向到场的亲友致欢迎辞后，举起我们的结婚戒指让所有人看。在到场的这些深爱我们的亲友见证下，他动人地讲述缔结婚姻意味着什么，这些人作为一个集合，了解贝拉克的全部、了解我的全部。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Our honeymoon was meant to be restful, a low-key road trip in Northern California, involving wine, sleep, mud baths, and good food. The day after the wedding, we flew to San Francisco, spent several days in Napa, and then drove down Highway 1 to Big Sur to read books, stare at the blue bowl of ocean, and clear our minds. It was glorious, despite the fact that Barack's head cold managed to return in full force, and also despite the mud baths, which we deemed to be unsoothing and kind of icky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的蜜月计划是去加利福尼亚州北部进行一次悠闲低调的自驾游，享受美酒、泥浆浴、美食还有睡懒觉。婚礼第二天，我们飞往旧金山，在纳帕待了几天，然后驱车上一号公路前往大苏尔。我们在那里读书，望着蔚蓝的大海发呆，放空自己。整个过程十分美好，虽然贝拉克的感冒又卷土重来且症状不轻；虽然泥浆浴并没有让我们感到放松，而是黏糊糊的有点不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a busy year, we were more than ready to kick back. Barack had originally planned to spend the months leading up to our wedding finishing his book and working at his new law firm, but he'd ended up putting most of it on an abrupt hold. Sometime early in 1992, he'd been approached by the leaders of a national nonpartisan organization called Project VOTE!, which spearheaded efforts to register new voters in states where minority turnout was traditionally low. They asked if Barack would run the process in Illinois, opening a field office in Chicago to enroll black voters ahead of the November elections. It was estimated that about 400,000 African Americans in the state were eligible to vote but still unregistered, the majority in and around Chicago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忙碌了一年后，我们已经准备好大干一场。贝拉克起初计划在我们婚礼前几个月完成他的书稿，然后入职新的律师事务所，但是最后这些计划都暂时搁置了。1992年年初的时候，一个名为“投票项目”的全国性无党派组织的领导人找到他，问他是否愿意负责该组织在伊利诺伊州的工作—在芝加哥设立一个分部，为11月的大选登记黑人选民。这个组织扮演着领头羊的角色，致力于在少数族裔投票率一向偏低的州登记新选民。据估计，伊利诺伊州大约有四十万非洲裔美国人具备投票资格而没有登记注册，他们主要集中在芝加哥市区及周边地区。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To say that Barack threw himself into the job would be an understatement. The goal of Project VOTE! was to sign up new Illinois voters at a staggering pace of ten thousand per week. The work was similar to what he'd done as a grassroots organizer: Over the course of the spring and summer, he and his staff had tromped through plenty of church basements, gone house to house to talk with unregistered voters. He networked regularly with community leaders and made his pitch countless times to wealthy donors, helping to fund the production of radio ads and informational brochures that could be handed out in black neighborhoods and public-housing projects. The organization's message was unwavering and clear, and a straight reflection of what I knew Barack felt in his heart: There was power in voting. If you wanted change, you couldn't stay home on Election Day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果只是简单地说贝拉克积极投身于这份工作，那就显得有些轻描淡写了。要知道，“投票项目”的目标是以一周一万人的惊人速度来登记伊利诺伊州的新选民。这份工作类似于他做基层组织者时的工作：在那年春夏两季，他和他的团队去了无数教堂的地下室，挨家挨户跟没有注册的选民谈话。他和社区领袖保持着紧密联系，无数次地游说富裕的捐赠者出资，帮助制作电台广告并在黑人社区以及公共住宅区散发宣传手册。那个组织的目标坚定而明确，且直接反映了贝拉克内心的想法—投票是会产生影响的。如果你想要变革，就不能在大选日那天待在家里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pay was abysmal, but the job appealed to Barack's core beliefs. In 1983, a similar voter-registration drive in Chicago had helped propel Harold Washington into office. In 1992, the stakes again felt high: Another African American candidate, Carol Moseley Braun, had surprised everyone by narrowly winning the Democratic nomination for the U. S. Senate race and was locked in what would become a tight race in the general election. Bill Clinton, meanwhile, would be running against George H. W. Bush for president. It was no time for minority voters to be sitting out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那份工作的薪水少得可怜，但是符合贝拉克的核心理念。1983年，在芝加哥进行的一个类似的选民登记运动帮助哈罗德·华盛顿成功当选市长。1992年，赌注的风险也很高，结果另一位非洲裔候选人—卡罗尔·莫斯利－布朗在美国参议院的选举中以微弱优势获得了民主党的提名（后来，也就是2004年，他还参加了竞争激烈的总统大选）。同时，比尔·克林顿将与乔治·H. W。布什（老布什）在大选中展开对决。此时不是少数族裔选民置身事外的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I, meanwhile, was fully steeped in government. I'd spent a year now working with Valerie in the mayor's office, acting as a liaison to several of the city's departments, including Health and Human Services. The job was broad and people oriented enough to be energizing and almost always interesting. Whereas I'd once spent my days writing briefs in a quiet, plush-carpeted office with a view of the lake, I now worked in a windowless room on one of the top floors of city hall, with citizens streaming noisily through the building every hour of the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而我也完全投身于政府事务。我当时已经跟着瓦莱丽在市长办公室工作了一年，负责几个部门之间的联络工作，包括卫生及公共服务部门。工作涉及的范围很广，直接为民众服务，这让我充满活力，而且感觉十分有趣。曾几何时，我在一间安静的铺着豪华地毯的办公室里写案情摘要，一抬头就能看到窗外的密歇根湖。后来，我在市政厅最高楼层的一间没有窗户的房间里工作，每天都有人在喧闹、在大楼里进进出出，一刻不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evenings, Barack came home to our place on Euclid Avenue and often flopped on the couch, reeking of the cigarettes he still smoked when he was out of my sight. He appeared tired but never depleted. He kept careful track of the registration tallies: They were averaging an impressive seven thousand a week in midsummer but were still falling short of the goal. He strategized about how to get the message across, how to wrangle more volunteers and find pockets of people who remained unfound. He seemed to view the challenges as a Rubik's Cube-like puzzle that could be solved if only he could swivel the right blocks in the right order. The hardest people to reach, he told me, were the younger folks, the eighteen- to thirty-year-olds who seemed to have no faith in government at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上，贝拉克回到我们在欧几里得大道的家，经常一屁股坐在沙发上，浑身散发着烟味儿—他还在背着我抽烟。他看起来很疲惫但并不颓废。他认真地记录着注册的人数，到仲夏时达到平均每周七千人，已经很了不起了，但是还没有达到预定目标。他在制订行动计划—如何将信息传递出去，如何争取更多的选民、找到更多的资助。他似乎把那些挑战视为像魔方一样的智力测验，只要他能把正确的方块以正确的顺序排好，问题就可以迎刃而解。他告诉我，最难说动的人群是十八岁到三十岁之间的年轻人，他们似乎对政府完全没有信心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was learning something else of value, too, spending much of my time in the presence of Susan Sher and Valerie Jarrett, two women who -- I was seeing -- managed to be both tremendously confident and tremendously human at the same time. Susan ran meetings with a steely and unflappable grace. Valerie thought nothing of speaking her mind in a roomful of opinionated men, often managing to deftly bring people around to whatever side she was arguing. She was like a fast-moving comet, someone who was clearly going places. Not long before my wedding, she'd been promoted to the role of commissioner in charge of planning and economic development for the city and had offered me a job as an assistant commissioner. I was going to begin work as soon as we got back from our honeymoon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Government issues, I was learning, were elaborate and unending. I shuttled between meetings with various department heads, worked with the staffs of city commissioners, and was dispatched sometimes to different neighborhoods around Chicago to follow up on personal complaints received by the mayor. I went on missions to inspect fallen trees that needed removing, talked to neighborhood pastors who were upset about traffic or garbage collection, and often represented the mayor's office at community functions. I once had to break up a shoving match at a senior citizens' picnic on the North Side. None of this was what a corporate lawyer did, and for this reason I found it compelling.

<div class="line_en">I saw more of Valerie than I did of Susan, but I took careful note of everything each of them did, similarly to how I'd observed Czerny, my college mentor. These were women who knew their own voices and were unafraid to use them. They could be humorous and humble when the moment called for it, but they were unfazed by blowhards and didn't second-guess the power in their own points of view. Also, importantly, they were working moms. I watched them closely in this regard as well, knowing that I wanted someday to be one myself. Valerie never hesitated to step out of a big meeting when a call came in from her daughter's school. Susan, likewise, dashed out in the middle of the day if one of her sons spiked a fever or was performing in a preschool music show. They were unapologetic about prioritizing the needs of their children, even if it meant occasionally disrupting the flow at work, and didn't try to compartmentalize work and home the way I'd noticed male partners at Sidley seemed to do. I'm not sure compartmentalization was even a choice for Valerie and Susan, given that they were juggling the expectations unique to mothers and were also both divorced, which came with its own emotional and financial challenges. They weren't striving for perfect, but managed somehow to be always excellent, the two of them bound in a deep and mutually helpful friendship, which also made a real impression on me. They'd dropped any masquerade and were just wonderfully, powerfully, and instructively themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和瓦莱丽的接触比跟苏珊要多，但是我仔细观察了她们两人做的所有事情，就像我当初观察我大学时的良师益友泽妮一样。她们都是了解自己的声音而且不惮于使用它们的女人。她们在需要的时候会表现得幽默而谦卑，但是遇到满口大话的人也不会被吓倒，而且她们不会怀疑自己所持观点的力量。还有很重要的一点：她们都是职场妈妈。我在这方面也认真观察过她们，因为我知道自己将来有一天也会扮演这样的角色。瓦莱丽即使在开大会时，接到女儿学校打来的电话，也会马上走出会场。苏珊也一样，如果她的儿子发高烧或者要在幼儿园的音乐会上表演，她会在上班时间冲出去。她们毫不愧疚地将自己孩子的需求摆在第一位，即使那会打乱工作节奏，她们也没有试图将工作和家庭截然分开。我在盛德工作时，发现事务所的男性合伙人会将工作和家庭截然分开。我不确定这种区分对瓦莱丽和苏珊而言算不算一种选择，因为她们既要承担起母亲应尽的各种责任，又都离了婚，需要面对情感上的动荡和经济上的挑战。她们并没有追求完美，但总是能够做到出色，两人之间还缔结了深厚的、互助的友谊，这也给我留下了极为深刻的印象。她们扔下了所有伪装，活出了自己，而且活得精彩，活得内心强大，并给他人树立了榜样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack and I came back from our honeymoon in Northern California to both good and bad news. The good news came in the form of the November election, which brought what felt like a tide of encouraging change. Bill Clinton won overwhelmingly in Illinois and across the country, moving President Bush out of office after only one term. Carol Moseley Braun also won decisively, becoming the first African American woman ever to hold a Senate seat. What was even more exciting to Barack was that the Election Day turnout had been nothing short of epic: Project VOTE! had directly registered 110,000 new voters, and its broader get-out-the-vote campaign had likely boosted overall turnout as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克和我从加利福尼亚州北部度蜜月归来后，迎接我们的既有好消息也有坏消息。好消息是11月的大选带来了一轮鼓舞人心的变化。比尔·克林顿在伊利诺伊州和全国范围内取得了压倒性的胜利，将只做了一个任期的老布什总统请下了台。卡罗尔·莫斯利－布朗也取得了决定性的胜利，成为美国历史上首位非洲裔女参议员。更让贝拉克兴奋的是，大选日当天的投票人数足以载入史册，通过“投票项目”直接登记的就有十一万新选民，它发起的范围广泛的“走出去投票”宣传活动对整体的投票人数可能产生了很大的带动作用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the first time in a decade, over half a million black voters in Chicago went to the polls, proving that they had the collective power to shape political outcomes. This sent a clear message to lawmakers and future politicians and reestablished a feeling that seemed to have been lost when Harold Washington died: The African American vote mattered. It would be costly politically for anyone to ignore or discount black people's needs and concerns. Inside of this, too, was a secondary message to the black community itself, a reminder that progress was possible, that our worth was measurable. All this was heartening for Barack. As tiring as it was, he'd loved his job for what it taught him about Chicago's complex political system and for proving that his organizing instincts could work on a larger scale. He'd collaborated with grassroots leaders, everyday citizens, and elected officials, and almost miraculously it had yielded results. Several media outlets noted the impressive impact of Project VOTE! A writer for Chicago magazine described Barack as "a tall, affable workaholic," suggesting that he should someday run for office, an idea that he simply shrugged off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近十年来第一次，芝加哥有超过五十万黑人选民参与了投票，这证明了他们团结起来的力量能够改变政治结果。这也向立法者和未来的从政者传递了一个清晰的信息，重新确立了一种随着哈罗德·华盛顿的离世而消失的感觉，那就是：非洲裔美国人的投票是十分重要的，任何人如果无视或者不重视黑人的需求和关切，将会在政治上付出高昂的代价。这也间接地向黑人群体传递了一个信息，进步是可能的，他们的价值是可见的。所有这些都让贝拉克感到振奋。虽然很累，但是贝拉克热爱这份工作，它让他了解了芝加哥复杂的政治体系，也证明了他的组织天分可以在更广的层面上得到发挥。他与基层领导、普通公民和当选的官员通力合作，并奇迹般地取得了成果。有几家媒体已经注意到了“投票项目”的重大影响。《芝加哥》杂志的一位撰稿人将贝拉克描述为一个“高个子、为人友善的工作狂”，并建议他将来也竞选公职，贝拉克对此不以为意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If he panicked, he didn't do it in front of me. I was busy enough shifting into my new role at city hall, which entailed going to more zoning board meetings and fewer senior citizen picnics than my previous job had. Though I was no longer working corporate-lawyer hours, the city's everyday fracas left me spent in the evenings, less interested in processing any stresses at home and more ready to pour a glass of wine, switch my brain off, and watch TV on the couch. If I'd learned anything from Barack's obsessive involvement with Project VOTE!, anyway, it was that it wasn't helpful for me to worry about his worries -- in part because I seemed to find them more overwhelming than he ever did. Chaos agitated me, but it seemed to invigorate Barack. He was like a circus performer who liked to set plates spinning: If things got too calm, he took it as a sign that there was more to do. He was a serial over-committer, I was coming to understand, taking on new projects without much regard for limits of time and energy. He'd said yes, for example, to serving on the boards of a couple of nonprofits while also saying yes to a part-time teaching job at the University of Chicago for the coming spring semester while also planning to work full-time at the law firm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算他着了慌，那他起码也没有在我面前表现出来。那时我正忙着适应市政厅的新工作，相比之前的工作，我当时要参加很多分区董事会议，老年人野餐会这样的活动就去得少了。虽然我每天的工作时间没有之前做公司法律师时那么长，但市政厅烦琐的事务让我到了晚上已筋疲力尽，不想再处理家里的麻烦事，而更愿意倒一杯葡萄酒，脑子什么都不想，只坐在沙发上看电视。如果说我从贝拉克对“投票项目”神魂颠倒的投入里学到了什么东西的话，那就是替他着急也没用，部分原因是，我比他的压力还要大。混乱让我不安，但是似乎让贝拉克精神焕发。他就像杂技团的表演者一样，喜欢看着一堆盘子转起来，如果事情太平静了，他就会觉得还需要做更多的事情。我逐渐意识到，他是个停不下来的工作狂，完全不考虑时间和精力的极限，一直在接新工作。比如，他一面答应在几个非营利组织的董事会任职，一面又答应芝加哥大学在第二年的春季学期兼职教一门课，同时还计划着在律师事务所做全职工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And here was the bad news: That tall, affable workaholic I'd just married had also blown his book deadline, having been so caught up in registering voters that he'd managed to turn in only a partial manuscript. We got home from California to learn that the publisher had canceled his contract, sending word through his literary agent that Barack was now on the hook to pay back his $40,000 advance.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then there was the book. Barack's agent felt sure she could resell the idea to a different publisher, though he'd have to get a draft finished soon. With his teaching gig yet to begin and having obtained the blessing of the law firm that had waited a year already for him to start full-time, he came up with a solution that seemed to suit him perfectly: He'd write the book in isolation, removing his everyday distractions by renting a little cabin somewhere and drilling down hard on the work. It was the equivalent of pulling a frantic all-nighter to get a paper done in college, only Barack was estimating it would take him roughly a couple of months to get the book finished. He relayed all of this to me one night at home about six weeks after our wedding, before delicately dropping a final bit of information: His mother had found him the perfect cabin. In fact, she'd already rented it for him. It was cheap, quiet, and on the beach. In Sanur. Which was on the Indonesian island of Bali, some nine thousand miles away from me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Which is to say that at the start of 1993, Barack flew to Bali and spent about five weeks living alone with his thoughts while working on a draft of his book Dreams from My Father, filling yellow legal pads with his fastidious handwriting, distilling his ideas during languid daily walks amid the coconut palms and lapping tide. I, meanwhile, stayed home on Euclid Avenue, living upstairs from my mother as another leaden Chicago winter descended, shellacking the trees and sidewalks with ice. I kept myself busy, seeing friends and hitting workout classes in the evenings. In my regular interactions at work or around town, I'd find myself casually uttering this strange new term --"my husband." My husband and I are hoping to buy a home. My husband is a writer finishing a book. It was foreign and delightful and conjured memories of a man who simply wasn't there. I missed Barack terribly, but I rationalized our situation as I could, understanding that even if we were newlyweds, this interlude was probably for the best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也就是说，1993年年初，贝拉克飞到了巴厘岛，独自和他的思想一起度过了五周，写他那本名为《我父亲的梦想》的书。黄色的美式笔记本上写满了一行行工整的字。他每天在椰子树和拍打着海岸的浪花间漫步，撷取写作灵感。与此同时，我留在欧几里得大道的家里，住在母亲的楼上。又一个铅灰色的冬天降临在了芝加哥，树上和人行道上都结了冰。我把自己的生活安排得很满，晚上会去见朋友或者上健身课。在平常工作或者在市里和朋友聚会时，我发现自己能随口说出那个奇怪的新名词—“我的丈夫”。我的丈夫和我想买一套房子。我的丈夫是个即将出书的作家。那个词新鲜，让人愉快，是对一个不在场的男人的记忆再现。我非常想念贝拉克，但是我为当时的情况找到了合理的解释：虽然我们新婚宴尔，但这种小别的插曲可能也是有好处的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For many women, including myself, "wife" can feel like a loaded word. It carries a history. If you grew up in the 1960s and 1970s as I did, wives seemed to be a genus of white women who lived inside television sitcoms -- cheery, coiffed, corseted. They stayed at home, fussed over the children, and had dinner ready on the stove. They sometimes got into the sherry or flirted with the vacuum-cleaner salesman, but the excitement seemed to end there. The irony, of course, was that I used to watch those shows in our living room on Euclid Avenue while my own stay-at-home mom fixed dinner without complaint and my own clean-cut dad recovered from a day at work. My parents' arrangement was as traditional as anything we saw on TV. Barack sometimes jokes, in fact, that my upbringing was like a black version of Leave It to Beaver, with the South Shore Robinsons as steady and fresh-faced as the Cleaver family of Mayfield, U. S. A., though of course we were a poorer version of the Cleavers, with my dad's blue city worker's uniform subbing for Mr. Cleaver's suit. Barack makes this comparison with a touch of envy, because his own childhood was so different, but also as a way to push back on the entrenched stereotype that African Americans primarily live in broken homes, that our families are somehow incapable of living out the same stable, middle-class dream as our white neighbors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于许多女人而言，包括我自己，“妻子”是一个有特定含义的词。它承载着历史。如果你和我一样，在20世纪60年代和70年代长大，你应该会有和我一样的感受，妻子似乎就是那种电视情景喜剧里的白人女性，她们愉快活泼，头发梳得整整齐齐，穿着紧身胸衣。她们待在家里，围着孩子转，在灶台前把晚饭做好。她们有时会喝杯雪利酒，和真空吸尘器推销员调情，但是兴奋之处似乎也就到此为止。讽刺的是，那时在我们欧几里得大道的起居室里，经常是我在看这些电视剧，而我那个待在家里的母亲则毫无怨言地在准备晚饭，我仪表整洁的父亲工作一天后在休息。我父母的分工和我们在电视上看到的一样传统。贝拉克有时会开玩笑说，我的成长过程像是黑人版的《反斗小宝贝》 [1]，住在南岸社区的罗宾逊一家和住在梅菲尔德的克利弗一家一样安稳、幸福，不过我们是贫穷版本的克利弗一家，我父亲穿的是蓝色城市工人制服，克利弗先生则西装革履。贝拉克做这个类比时带着一丝羡慕，因为他自己的童年非常不同，另外，这也颠覆了人们对非洲裔美国人的那种固有印象，认为我们大都住在破败不堪的房子里，我们的家庭也无法像我们的白人邻居那样，实现安稳的中产阶级梦想。【注：[1] 《反斗小宝贝》（Leave It to Beaver），美国20世纪50年代的电视剧，片中的克利弗家，已成为美国中产阶级白人家庭的模范。他们这一家，就是你希望自己也拥有的那种快乐家庭，包括一个亦师亦友的聪明老爸华德、高贵又能干的妈妈琼、在学校出尽风头的运动健将大哥华利，以及幺儿小毕。小毕是个平凡的八岁小男孩，他总是努力让自己少惹麻烦，但是最后总是有一千个理由把事情搞得一团糟。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And here I was now, twenty-nine years old, sitting in the very same apartment where I'd watched all that TV and consumed all those meals dished up by the patient and selfless Marian Robinson. I had so much -- an education, a healthy sense of self, a deep arsenal of ambition -- and I was wise enough to credit my mother, in particular, with instilling it in me. She'd taught me how to read before I started kindergarten, helping me sound out words as I sat curled like a kitten in her lap, studying a library copy of Dick and Jane. She'd cooked for us with care, putting broccoli and Brussels sprouts on our plates and requiring that we eat them. She'd hand sewn my prom dress, for God's sake. The point was, she'd given diligently and she'd given everything. She'd let our family define her. I was old enough now to realize that all the hours she gave to me and Craig were hours she didn't spend on herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Personally, as a kid, I preferred The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which I absorbed with fascination. Mary had a job, a snappy wardrobe, and really great hair. She was independent and funny, and unlike those of the other ladies on TV, her problems were interesting. She had conversations that weren't about children or homemaking. She didn't let Lou Grant boss her around, and she wasn't fixated on finding a husband. She was youthful and at the same time grown-up. In the pre-pre-pre-internet landscape, when the world came packaged almost exclusively through three channels of network TV, this stuff mattered. If you were a girl with a brain and a dawning sense that you wanted to grow into something more than a wife, Mary Tyler Moore was your goddess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就我自己来说，小时候我更喜欢的是《玛丽·泰勒·摩尔秀》 [2]，看得入了迷。玛丽有一份工作，有时髦的衣服，头发也很好看。她独立且有趣，和电视里其他女人不同，她遇到的问题都很有意思。她不会谈论孩子和家庭琐事。她不允许卢·格兰特对自己颐指气使，她也不一心只想找个男人嫁了。她既活力四射又成熟老练。在网络时代到来很久很久之前，世界几乎完全是通过三个电视频道呈现在我们面前的，而它们的影响很大。如果你是一个有头脑的女孩，并模糊地认识到你未来不想只成为一个妻子，那么玛丽·泰勒·摩尔就是你的女神。【注：[2] 《玛丽·泰勒·摩尔秀》（Mary Tyler Moore Show），1970年上映的美国电视剧，该剧讲述的是女性如何在光怪陆离的大都市中发现自己、爱自己的故事。】">查看中文翻译</div>

I'd been raised to be confident and see no limits, to believe I could go after and get absolutely anything I wanted. And I wanted everything. Because, as Suzanne would say, why not? I wanted to live with the hat-tossing, independent-career-woman zest of Mary Tyler Moore, and at the same time I gravitated toward the stabilizing, self-sacrificing, seemingly bland normalcy of being a wife and mother. I wanted to have a work life and a home life, but with some promise that one would never fully squelch the other. I hoped to be exactly like my own mother and at the same time nothing like her at all. It was an odd and confounding thing to ponder. Could I have everything? Would I have everything?

Later that spring, we had our finances in order enough to buy a condo, moving out of 7436 South Euclid Avenue and into a pretty, railroad-style apartment in Hyde Park with hardwood floors and a tiled fireplace, a new launchpad for our life. With Barack's encouragement, I took another risk and switched jobs again, this time saying good-bye to Valerie and Susan at city hall in order to finally explore the kind of nonprofit work that had always intrigued me, finding a leadership role that would give me a chance to grow. There was still plenty I hadn't figured out about my life -- the riddle of how to be both a Mary and a Marian remained unsolved -- but for now all those deeper questions drifted out to the margins of my mind, where they'd sit dormant and unattended for the time being.
