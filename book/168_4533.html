<div class="line_en">They'd covered poor Barmen with a pile of furs and stoked the fire high, yet all he could say was, "I'm cold. Please. I'm so cold."

<div class="line_en">More broth ran from the corner of Barmen's mouth. Sam dabbed it away with a corner of his sleeve. The ranger's eyes were open but unseeing. "I'm cold," he said again, so faintly. A maester might have known how to save him, but they had no maester. Kedge Whiteye had taken Barmen's mangled foot off nine days past, in a gout of pus and blood that made Sam sick, but it was too little, too late. "I'm so cold," the pale lips repeated.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Be glad I didn't grudge you fire too." Craster was a thick man made thicker by the ragged smelly sheepskins he wore day and night. He had a broad flat nose, a mouth that drooped to one side, and a missing ear. And though his matted hair and tangled beard might be grey going white, his hard knuckly hands still looked strong enough to hurt. "I fed you what I could, but you crows are always hungry. I'm a godly man, else I would have chased you off. You think I need the likes of him, dying on my floor? You think I need all your mouths, little man?" The wildling spat. "Crows. When did a black bird ever bring good to a man's hall, I ask you? Never. Never."</div>

<div class="line_en">About the hall, a ragged score of black brothers squatted on the floor or sat on rough-hewn benches, drinking cups of the same thin onion broth and gnawing on chunks of hardbread. A couple were wounded worse than Bannen, to look at them. Fornio had been delirious for days, and Ser Byam's shoulder was oozing a foul yellow pus. When they'd left Castle Black, Brown Bernarr had been carrying bags of Myrish fire, mustard salve, ground garlic, tansy, poppy, kingscopper, and other healing herbs. Even sweetsleep, which gave the gift of painless death. But Brown Bernarr had died on the Fist and no one had thought to search for Maester Aemon's medicines. Hake had known some herblore as well, being a cook, but Hake was also lost. So it was left to the surviving stewards to do what they could for the wounded, which was little enough. At least they are dry here, with a fire to warm them. They need more food, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅里，二十余衣衫褴褛的黑衣弟兄散坐在地板或粗糙的长凳上，喝着同样稀薄的洋葱汤，啃吃块块硬面包。有几个伤势比巴棱更严重。佛尼奥已好几天昏迷不醒，拜延爵士肩上渗出恶臭的黄色脓水。离开黑城堡时，游骑兵黄伯纳带了几口袋密尔火、芥末膏、大蒜粉、艾菊、罂粟、铜板草及其他药材，甚至有甜睡花，可以赐人无痛苦的死亡。但黄伯纳死在先民拳峰，而没人想到拯救伊蒙学士的药品。作为厨师，哈克了解一些草药知识，但他也死了。因此只剩几个事务官来照料伤员，这是不够的。虽然这里干干燥燥，有火取暖，但他们还需要更多食物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all needed more food. The men had been grumbling for days. Clubfoot Karl kept saying how Craster had to have a hidden larder, and Garth of Oldtown had begun to echo him, when he was out of the Lord Commander's hearing. Sam had thought of begging for something more nourishing for the wounded men at least, but he did not have the courage. Craster's eyes were cold and mean, and whenever the wildling looked his way his hands twitched a little, as if they wanted to curl up into fists. Does he know I spoke to Gilly, the last time we were here? he wondered. Did she tell him I said we'd take her? Did he beat it out of her?</div>

<div class="line_en">Up in the loft, Gilly let out a shuddering sob that echoed down the long low windowless hall. "Push," he heard one of Craster's older wives tell her. "Harder. Harder. Scream if it helps." She did, so loud it made Sam wince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阁楼上，吉莉发出一阵颤抖的哭泣，在低矮无窗的长厅里回荡。“用力，”他听见卡斯特一个较年长的老婆发话，“再使点劲。再使点劲。要喊就喊出来。”于是她开始尖叫，把山姆吓了一跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He would too, Sam knew. Craster had nineteen wives, but none who'd dare interfere once he started up that ladder. No more than the black brothers had two nights past, when he was beating one of the younger girls. There had been mutterings, to be sure. "He's killing her " Garth of Greenaway had said, and Clubfoot Karl laughed and said, "If he don't want the little sweetmeat he could give her to me." Black Bernarr cursed in a low angry voice, and Alan of Rosby got up and went outside so he wouldn't have to hear. "His roof, his rule," the ranger Ronnel Harclay had reminded them. "Craster's a friend to the Watch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆知道他不是开玩笑。卡斯特共有十九个老婆，可他踏上梯子的时候，她们中没一个敢反抗。就两天前的夜里，他狠狠揍过一个更年幼的女孩，黑衣弟兄同样没干预。当然，有人嘀嘀咕咕。“他会杀了她的，”格林纳威的加尔斯说，而畸足卡尔笑道，“他不想要这小甜心，给我啊。”黑伯纳低声怒骂，而罗斯比的阿兰起身出门，这样听不着声音。“他的屋檐下，他说了算，”游骑兵罗纳·哈克莱提醒大家，“卡斯特是咱守夜人的朋友。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A friend, thought Sam, as he listened to Gilly's muffled shrieks. Craster was a brutal man who ruled his wives and daughters with an iron hand, but his keep was a refuge all the same. "Frozen crows," Craster sneered when they straggled in, those few who had survived the snow, the wights, and the bitter cold. "And not so big a flock as went north, neither." Yet he had given them space on his floor, a roof to keep the snow off, a fire to dry them out, and his wives had brought them cups of hot wine to put some warmth in their bellies. "Bloody crows," he called them, but he'd fed them too, meager though the fare might be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朋友，山姆一边想，一边听吉莉压抑的尖叫。卡斯特是个恶棍，无情地统治着他的老婆和女儿们，但他的堡垒对守夜人而言，却是难能可贵的避难所。就说这次，当经历了大雪、尸鬼与严寒而幸存的人们狼狈不堪地来到时，卡斯特虽然冷笑讥讽，“一群冻僵的乌鸦，还少了不少！”却依旧腾出地板，并提供遮挡风雪的屋檐和烤干身子的火盆，他老婆们还端来杯杯热葡萄酒，让大家暖肠胃。他称他们为“该死的乌鸦”，但也给些吃的，尽管不怎么可口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first time he'd seen Craster's Keep, Gilly had come begging for help, and Sam had lent her his black cloak to conceal her belly when she went to find Jon Snow. Knights are supposed to defend women and children. Only a few of the black brothers were knights, but even so… We all say the words, Sam thought. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. A woman was a woman, even a wildling woman. We should help her. We should. It was her child Gilly feared for; she was frightened that it might be a boy. Craster raised up his daughters to be his wives, but there were neither men nor boys to be seen about his compound. Gilly had told Jon that Craster gave his sons to the gods. If the gods are good, they will send her a daughter, Sam prayed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="初到卡斯特堡垒时，吉莉前来求助，山姆便把自己的黑斗篷给她，好让她去找琼恩·雪诺时可以藏起肚子。誓言效命的骑士应该保护妇女和儿童，不是吗？虽然只有少数几个黑衣弟兄称得上骑士，但…我们都发过誓，山姆心想，我们是守护王国的坚盾。女人总是女人，就算女野人也一样。我们应该帮她，救她。吉莉担心的是孩子，她怕生男孩。卡斯特会把女儿抚养长大，弄来当老婆，但他的堡垒里既没成年男子也没小男孩。吉莉告诉琼恩，卡斯特将儿子奉献给神。诸神慈悲，给她一个女儿，山姆祈祷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cold," said Barmen, weakly. "Please. I'm so cold." Sam put the bowl and spoon aside, tossed another fur across the dying man, put another stick on the fire. Gilly gave a shriek, and began to pant. Craster gnawed on his hard black sausage. He had sausages for himself and his wives, he said, but none for the Watch. "Women," he complained. "The way they wail… I had me a fat sow once birthed a litter of eight with no more'n a grunt." Chewing, he turned his head to squint contemptuously at Sam. "She was near as fat as you, boy. Slayer." He laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冷，”巴棱虚弱地说，“帮帮我，好冷。”山姆放下碗勺，又替濒死的弟兄多盖一层毛皮，并往火盆中添木柴。吉莉惨叫一声，然后开始喘气。卡斯特啃着硬梆梆的黑香肠——香肠他留给自己和老婆们，守夜人没有份。“女人，”他抱怨，“就这副德行…还不及我从前那头肥母猪，一窝生八只，声都没吭。”他边嚼边转头轻蔑地斜视山姆，“它几乎跟你一样肥咧，小杀手。”说完哈哈大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

He stumbled away from the firepit, stepping awkwardly over and around the men sleeping and squatting and dying upon the hard-packed earthen floor. The smoke and screams and moans were making him feel faint. Bending his head, he pushed through the hanging deerhide flaps that served Craster for a door and stepped out into the afternoon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这太过分了，于是山姆蹒跚着离开火盆，笨拙地跨绕开硬泥地上或睡或坐或垂死的人群，朝外走去。烟雾、尖叫和呻吟让他晕眩，他低头掀起卡斯特用来当门的鹿皮，进到下午的天光中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day was cloudy, but still bright enough to blind him after the gloom of the hall. Some patches of snow weighed down the limbs of surrounding trees and blanketed the gold and russet hills, but fewer than there had been. The storm had passed on, and the days at Craster's Keep had been… well, not warm perhaps, but not so bitter cold. Sam could hear the soft drip-dripdrip of water melting off the icicles that bearded the edge of the thick sod roof. He took a deep shuddering breath and looked around.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam turned red. "It wasn't an arrow, it was a dagger, dragonglass… He knew what would happen if he took the bow. He would miss the butt and send the arrow sailing over the dike off into the trees. Then he'd hear the laughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not face them; the mocking smiles, the mean little jests, the contempt in their eyes. Sam turned to go back the way he'd come, but his right foot sank deep in the muck, and when he tried to pull it out his boot came off. He had to kneel to wrench it free, laughter ringing in his ears. Despite all his socks, the snowmelt had soaked through to his toes by the time he made his escape. Useless, he thought miserably. My father saw me true.

<div class="line_en">But Dywen listened, and Dolorous Edd, and they made Sam and Grenn tell the Lord Commander. Mormont frowned all through the tale and asked pointed questions, but he was too cautious a man to shun any possible advantage. He asked Sam for all the dragonglass in his pack, though that was little enough. Whenever Sam thought of the cache Jon had found buried beneath the Fist, it made him want to cry. There'd been dagger blades and spearheads, and two or three hundred arrowheads at least. Jon had made daggers for himself, Sam, and Lord Commander Mormont, and he'd given Sam a spearhead, an old broken horn, and some arrowheads. Grenn had taken a handful of arrowheads as well, but that was all.</div>

<div class="line_en">It will not be enough, Sam thought. Craster's sloping palisades of mud and melting snow would hardly slow the wights, who'd climbed the much steeper slopes of the Fist to swarm over the ringwall. And instead of three hundred brothers drawn up in disciplined ranks to meet them, the wights would find forty-one ragged survivors, nine too badly hurt to fight. Forty-four had come straggling into Craster's out of the storm, out of the sixty-odd who'd cut their way free of the Fist, but three of those had died of their wounds, and Bannen would soon make four.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是不够的，山姆心想，卡斯特的土堤和湿泥融雪迟滞不了尸鬼的步伐，就连先民拳峰的陡坡都不起作用。它们依旧顽强地爬上来，涌入环墙。这次尸鬼会发现，迎接他们的不再是三百纪律严明、阵容整齐的弟兄，而是四十一个狼狈不堪的幸存者，其中有九个伤势严重，无法参战。一共六十多人从先民拳峰杀出，四十四人顶着暴风雪逃回卡斯特的堡垒，这几天，又有三人伤重而亡，巴棱很快将成为第四个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So now all they had was Mormont's dagger and the one Sam had given Grenn, plus nineteen arrows and a tall hardwood spear with a black dragonglass head. The sentries passed the spear along from watch to watch, while Mormont had divided the arrows among his best bowmen. Muttering Bill, Garth Greyfeather, Ronnel Harclay, Sweet Donnel Hill, and Alan of Rosby had three apiece, and Ulmer had four. But even if they made every shaft tell, they'd soon be down to fire arrows like all the rest. They had loosed hundreds of fire arrows on the Fist, yet still the wights kept coming.</div>

I wish Jon was here. He liked Grenn, but he couldn't talk to him the same way. Jon wouldn't call me Slayer, I know And I could talk to him about Gilly's baby.

<div class="line_en">Craster moved quicker than Sam would have believed possible, vaulting across the table with axe in hand. A woman screamed, Garth Greenaway and Orphan Oss drew knives, Karl stumbled back and tripped over Ser Byarn lying wounded on the floor. One instant Craster was coming after him spitting curses. The next he was spitting blood. Dirk had grabbed him by the hair, yanked his head back, and opened his throat ear to ear with one long slash. Then he gave him a rough shove, and the wildling fell forward, crashing face first across Ser Byam. Byam screamed in agony as Craster drowned in his own blood, the axe slipping from his fingers. Two of Craster's wives were wailing, a third cursed, a fourth flew at Sweet Donnel and tried to scratch his eyes out. He knocked her to the floor. The Lord Commander stood over Craster's corpse, dark with anger. "The gods will curse us," he cried. "There is no crime so foul as for a guest to bring murder into a man's hall.

"Hold your tongue," Ollo warned. Instead the Lord Commander grabbed for his dagger. Ollo had only one hand, but that was quick.
