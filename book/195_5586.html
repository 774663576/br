<div class="line_en">Philip began to pawn his clothes. He reduced his expenses by eating only one meal a day beside his breakfast; and he ate it, bread and butter and cocoa, at four so that it should last him till next morning. He was so hungry by nine o'clock that he had to go to bed. He thought of borrowing money from Lawson, but the fear of a refusal held him back; at last he asked him for five pounds. Lawson lent it with pleasure, but, as he did so, said:</div>

Lawson was just going out to luncheon and asked Philip to come too. Philip could hardly eat, he was so glad to get some solid food. On Sunday he was sure of a good dinner from Athelny. He hesitated to tell the Athelnys what had happened to him: they had always looked upon him as comparatively well-to-do, and he had a dread that they would think less well of him if they knew he was penniless.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though he had always been poor, the possibility of not having enough to eat had never occurred to him; it was not the sort of thing that happened to the people among whom he lived; and he was as ashamed as if he had some disgraceful disease. The situation in which he found himself was quite outside the range of his experience. He was so taken aback that he did not know what else to do than to go on at the hospital; he had a vague hope that something would turn up; he could not quite believe that what was happening to him was true; and he remembered how during his first term at school he had often thought his life was a dream from which he would awake to find himself once more at home. But very soon he foresaw that in a week or so he would have no money at all. He must set about trying to earn something at once. If he had been qualified, even with a club-foot, he could have gone out to the Cape, since the demand for medical men was now great. Except for his deformity he might have enlisted in one of the yeomanry regiments which were constantly being sent out. He went to the secretary of the Medical School and asked if he could give him the coaching of some backward student; but the secretary held out no hope of getting him anything of the sort. Philip read the advertisement columns of the medical papers, and he applied for the post of unqualified assistant to a man who had a dispensary in the Fulham Road. When he went to see him, he saw the doctor glance at his club-foot; and on hearing that Philip was only in his fourth year at the hospital he said at once that his experience was insufficient: Philip understood that this was only an excuse; the man would not have an assistant who might not be as active as he wanted. Philip turned his attention to other means of earning money. He knew French and German and thought there might be some chance of finding a job as correspondence clerk; it made his heart sink, but he set his teeth; there was nothing else to do. Though too shy to answer the advertisements which demanded a personal application, he replied to those which asked for letters; but he had no experience to state and no recommendations: he was conscious that neither his German nor his French was commercial; he was ignorant of the terms used in business; he knew neither shorthand nor typewriting. He could not help recognising that his case was hopeless. He thought of writing to the solicitor who had been his father's executor, but he could not bring himself to, for it was contrary to his express advice that he had sold the mortgages in which his money had been invested. He knew from his uncle that Mr. Nixon thoroughly disapproved of him. He had gathered from Philip's year in the accountant's office that he was idle and incompetent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他的日子一直不富裕，可也没曾想过有朝一日会落到吃不饱肚子的下场。他身边也没有会为了一口吃的而发愁的人。贫穷就像一种难以启齿的疾病，害他羞愧得抬不起头来。他从没经历过这样的事，现在又惊又怕，想不出除了继续留在医院学习外，还能做些什么。他模模糊糊地希望未来能有所转机，甚至不愿相信现在经历的一切都是真实的。记得刚刚上学的时候，他就一直觉得生活是一场梦，梦醒之后才发现自己还好好躺在家里呢。然而没出多久，他就知道不出一个礼拜身上的钱就都会花光。他必须试着去挣点钱。现在战场急需医生，如果有了从医资格，即使有只跛足也可以随军队去开普敦。要不是因为残疾，他就能加入义勇骑兵队，现在这些部队正陆陆续续地派到国外战场去。他跑去问医学院的教务能否让他来辅导那些落后的学生，挣些外快，可教务老师说恐怕没有这样的工作机会。他从医药报纸的广告栏读到一则招工启事，一个在富勒姆街开药店的男人需要一名助理，没拿到从医资格的也可以。菲利普前去面试，那个医生瞥了眼他的跛足，又听说他才在医院待了四年，便立刻说他经验太少，不够格。菲利普听出这只是个借口，他肯定想找一个腿脚更灵便的助手。菲利普又瞄准其他挣钱的门道。他懂法语和德语，也许能找到份文书的工作，专门负责处理信件。尽管他心里沮丧，可除此之外，再没有别的工作可以做了，所以只能咬紧牙关，硬着头皮。尽管他不好意思回复那些需要投简历的岗位，但也试着给一些企业写过几封求职信。他没有相关经验，也没人为他引荐。商业术语他一窍不通，懂的那些德语和法语都不是做生意能用上的，更不会速记和打字。他不得不面对这样一个事实：没人能救得了他了。原本想给父亲遗嘱的执行人写信，却无论如何也下不了笔。当时他想卖掉自己的抵押契据时，那位律师曾明确阻拦，却只被他当成耳旁风。他从伯伯那里知道，尼克松先生对他很不满意。菲利普在他的律师事务所实习了一年，这段时间的表现让他觉得菲利普不过是个懒散无能的废人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once or twice the possibility of suicide presented itself to him; it would be easy to get something from the hospital dispensary, and it was a comfort to think that if the worst came to the worst he had at hand means of making a painless end of himself; but it was not a course that he considered seriously. When Mildred had left him to go with Griffiths his anguish had been so great that he wanted to die in order to get rid of the pain. He did not feel like that now. He remembered that the Casualty Sister had told him how people oftener did away with themselves for want of money than for want of love; and he chuckled when he thought that he was an exception. He wished only that he could talk his worries over with somebody, but he could not bring himself to confess them. He was ashamed. He went on looking for work. He left his rent unpaid for three weeks, explaining to his landlady that he would get money at the end of the month; she did not say anything, but pursed her lips and looked grim. When the end of the month came and she asked if it would be convenient for him to pay something on account, it made him feel very sick to say that he could not; he told her he would write to his uncle and was sure to be able to settle his bill on the following Saturday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一两次，他脑子里甚至冒出了自杀的念头：想从医院药房弄点药实在太简单了，如果日子迟迟不见起色，手边有个能轻松了结生命的法子倒不是什么坏事。可这终究只是个念头，他从没认真考虑过。米尔德里德跟着格里菲斯跑了之后，他曾经一度痛苦不堪，试图一死了之。可现在的难受劲儿却不像当时那么无法忍受。他想起那位急诊室的护士曾经说过，自杀的人大多不是因为没有爱，只是因为没有钱。他嘿嘿笑起来，觉得自己真是个例外。此刻，他只想把满腔愁绪说给别人听，但又羞于向他人坦白自己的境况。他还在继续找工作。房租已经拖欠了三个礼拜，只好一再跟房东太太解释月底一定筹到钱。房东太太噘着嘴唇，一脸不悦，但什么都没说。到了月底，她问菲利普方不方便先付一部分钱。而菲利普一分钱都拿不出来，手足无措地站在她面前，尴尬得想找个地缝钻进去。他跟房东保证要再给伯伯写信求助，下个礼拜六一定能把房租交上。">查看中文翻译</div>
