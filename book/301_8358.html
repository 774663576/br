Twice a day, a plentiful meal was served, but Siddhartha only ate once a day, and ate neither meat nor did he drink wine. Kamaswami told him about his trade, showed him the merchandise and storage-rooms, showed him calculations. Siddhartha got to know many new things, he heard a lot and spoke little. And thinking of Kamala's words, he was never subservient to the merchant, forced him to treat him as an equal, yes even more than an equal.

<div class="line_en">He was not in Kamaswami's house for long, when he already took part in his landlords business. But daily, at the hour appointed by her, he visited beautiful Kamala, wearing pretty clothes, fine shoes, and soon he brought her gifts as well. Much he learned from her red, smart mouth. Much he learned from her tender, supple hand. Him, who was, regarding love, still a boy and had a tendency to plunge blindly and insatiably into lust like into a bottomless pit, him she taught, thoroughly starting with the basics, about that school of thought which teaches that pleasure cannot be be taken without giving pleasure, and that every gesture, every caress, every touch, every look, every spot of the body, however small it was, had its secret, which would bring happiness to those who know about it and unleash it. She taught him, that lovers must not part from one another after celebrating love, without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having been abused. Wonderful hours he spent with the beautiful and smart artist, became her student, her lover, her friend. Here with Kamala was the worth and purpose of his present life, nit with the business of Kamaswami.</div>

<div class="line_en">The merchant passed to duties of writing important letters and contracts on to him and got into the habit of discussing all important affairs with him. He soon saw that Siddhartha knew little about rice and wool, shipping and trade, but that he acted in a fortunate manner, and that Siddhartha surpassed him, the merchant, in calmness and equanimity, and in the art of listening and deeply understanding previously unknown people. "This Brahman," he said to a friend, "is no proper merchant and will never be one, there is never any passion in his soul when he conducts our business. But he has that mysterious quality of those people to whom success comes all by itself, whether this may be a good star of his birth, magic, or something he has learned among Samanas.

<div class="line_cn" title='卡马斯瓦密采纳了这个建议。但是，席特哈尔塔仍然漫不经心。他得了红利，就不动声色地收下，有了亏损，他也是笑笑，说："嘿，这次又搞砸了！"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed indeed, as if he did not care about the business. At one time, he travelled to a village to buy a large harvest of rice there. But when he got there, the rice had already been sold to another merchant. Nevertheless, Siddhartha stayed for several days in that village, treated the farmers for a drink, gave copper-coins to their children, joined in the celebration of a wedding, and returned extremely satisfied from his trip. Kamaswami held against him that he had not turned back right away, that he had wasted time and money. Siddhartha answered: "Stop scolding, dear friend! Nothing was ever achieved by scolding. If a loss has occurred, let me bear that loss. I am very satisfied with this trip. I have gotten to know many kinds of people, a Brahman has become my friend, children have sat on my knees, farmers have shown me their fields, nobody knew that I was a merchant."</div>

But like this, I've had a few good days, I've learned, had joy, I've neither harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness. And if I'll ever return there again, perhaps to buy an upcoming harvest, or for whatever purpose it might be, friendly people will receive me in a friendly and happy manner, and I will praise myself for not showing any hurry and displeasure at that time. So, leave it as it is, my friend, and don't harm yourself by scolding!

<div class="line_en">Futile were also the merchant's attempts, to convince Siddhartha that he should eat his bread. Siddhartha ate his own bread, or rather they both ate other people's bread, all people's bread. Siddhartha never listened to Kamaswami's worries and Kamaswami had many worries. Whether there was a business-deal going on which was in danger of failing, or whether a shipment of merchandise seemed to have been lost, or a debtor seemed to be unable to pay, Kamaswami could never convince his partner that it would be useful to utter a few words of worry or anger, to have wrinkles on the forehead, to sleep badly. When, one day, Kamaswami held against him that he had learned everything he knew from him, he replied: "Would you please not kid me with such jokes! What I've learned from you is how much a basket of fish costs and how much interests may be charged on loaned money. These are your areas of expertise. I haven't learned to think from you, my dear Kamaswami, you ought to be the one seeking to learn from me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='卡马斯瓦密企图让席特哈尔塔想念他吃的是卡马斯瓦密的砚，结果是白费力气。席特哈尔塔吃的是他自己的面包，或者更确切地说，他们俩都是吃别人的砚，吃大家的砚。席特哈尔塔根本就听不进卡马斯瓦密的忧虑，而卡马斯瓦密却总是忧心忡忡。如果一桩生意有可能失败，如果一批货物运丢了，如果一个欠债人还不了债，那么，卡马斯瓦密休想让他的伙伴想念大发牢骚或者生气，皱紧眉头，睡不好觉，会有什么好处。有一次卡马斯瓦密指责他，说他懂得的一切都是跟他卡马斯瓦密学的，席特哈尔塔答道："你可别开这样的玩笑戏弄我！我向你学的是一满篮鱼能卖多少钱，贷出去的款可以要多少利息。这就是你的学问，而我会思考可不是向你学的，可敬的卡马斯瓦密，在这方面你还是跟我学学吧！"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed his soul was not with the trade. The business was good enough to provide him with the money for Kamala, and it earned him much more than he needed. Besides from this, Siddhartha's interest and curiosity was only concerned with the people, whose businesses, crafts, worries, pleasures, and acts of foolishness used to be as alien and distant to him as the moon. However easily he succeeded in talking to all of them, in living with all of them, in learning from all of them, he was still aware that there was something which separated him from them and this separating factor was him being a Samana. He saw mankind going trough life in a childlike or animallike manner, which he loved and also despised at the same time. He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured, he saw them scolding and insulting each other, he saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile, and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel.</div>

When Kamaswami came to him, to complain about his worries or to reproach him concerning his business, he listened curiously and happily, was puzzled by him, tried to understand him, consented that he was a little bit right, only as much as he considered indispensable, and turned away from him, towards the next person who would ask for him. And there were many who came to him, many to do business with him, many to cheat him, many to draw some secret out of him, many to appeal to his sympathy, many to get his advice. He gave advice, he pitied, he made gifts, he let them cheat him a bit, and this entire game and the passion with which all people played this game occupied his thoughts just as much as the gods and Brahmans used to occupy them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些人无论带给他什么，他都听之任之。给他提供亚麻布的商人他欢迎，找他告贷的欠债人他欢迎，给他讲自己的贫穷故事一讲就是一个钟头的乞丐他也欢迎，其实与沙门相比，乞丐的贫穷恐怕连一半都不够。他对待外国富商和给他刮脸的仆人没什么不同，跟那些在卖香蕉时总是坑他几个小钱的街头摊贩也没什么两样。当卡马斯瓦密来找他，向他诉说苦恼，或是为了一件买卖来责怪他时，他总是好奇而兴致勃勃地听着，对他感到惊奇，力求理解他，尽量使他有一些道理，而且正好是他认为必不可少的那么多，然后便转身离开他，转向下一个要见他的人了。有好多人来找他，好多人想跟他做生意，好多人想骗他，好多人想摸他的底，好多人想唤起他的同情，好多人想向他讨教。他提出建议，表示同情，慷慨解囊，让自己上一点当，而这整个游戏以及所有人在玩这游戏时的热情都使得他全神贯注，正像当年他热衷于神灵与婆罗门时那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At times he felt, deep in his chest, a dying, quiet voice, which admonished him quietly, lamented quietly; he hardly perceived it. And then, for an hour, he became aware of the strange life he was leading, of him doing lots of things which were only a game, of, though being happy and feeling joy at times, real life still passing him by and not touching him. As a ball-player plays with his balls, he played with his business-deals, with the people around him, watched them, found amusement in them; with his heart, with the source of his being, he was not with them. The source ran somewhere, far away from him, ran and ran invisibly, had nothing to do with his life any more. And at several times he suddenly became scared on account of such thoughts and wished that he would also be gifted with the ability to participate in all of this childlike-naive occupations of the daytime with passion and with his heart, really to live, really to act, really to enjoy and to live instead of just standing by as a spectator. Butagain and again, he came back to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practised the cult of lust, in which more than in anything else giving and taking becomes one, chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice, received advice. She understood him better than Govinda used to understand him, she was more similar to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时，他感到胸膛深处有一种衰亡的微弱声音，轻声提醒，轻声抱怨，几乎听不清。后来他开始意识到自己过的是一种奇怪的生活，他所做的事只是一种游戏，他很愉快，感到很快乐，但真正的生活却从身边流逝了，并没有触及他。就像一个球员玩球一样他拿他的生意来玩耍，与他周围的人玩耍，观察他们，跟他们寻开心，而他的心、他的生命的源泉却并不在那儿。这源泉流向了某个地方，离他很远走高飞，渐渐看不到了，不再与他的生活相关。有几次，他由于这样的想法而吓了一跳，希望自己也能满腔热忱、全心全意地参与日常的这些孩子般的行动，真正地生活，真正地做事，真正地享受和生活，而不仅仅是作为旁观者站在一边。他经常去拜访美丽的卡玛拉，学习爱情技巧，崇拜性满足，奉献和索取在这儿比在任何地方都更加合而为一。他跟卡玛拉闲聊，向她学习，给她出主意，也接受她的忠告。而卡玛拉也更加了解他，甚至胜过了当初戈文达对他的了解，她跟他更加相似了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, he said to her: "You are like me, you are different from most people. You are Kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be at home at yourself, as I can also do. Few people have this, and yet all could have it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='有一次他对卡玛拉说："你像我一样，跟大多数人不同你是卡玛拉，而不是别人，在你内心有一种沉静，那是个避难所，你随时都可以躲进去，就像到了家一样，我也是这样。只有为数不多的人会这样，但大家也可能学会。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Siddhartha, "that's not the reason why. Kamaswami is just as smart as I, and still has no refuge in himself. Others have it, who are small children with respect to their mind. Most people, Kamala, are like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground. But others, a few, are like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in themselves they have their law and their course. Among all the learned men and Samanas, of which I knew many, there was one of this kind, a perfected one, I'll never be able to forget him. It is that Gotama, the exalted one, who is spreading that teachings. Thousands of followers are listening to his teachings every day, follow his instructions every hour, but they are all falling leaves, not in themselves they have teachings and a law."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"不，"席特哈尔塔说，"关键并不在这里。卡马斯瓦密像我一样聪明，可是他心里就没有避难所。其他人有，但是在智力上却是小孩子。卡玛拉，大多数人都好像一片落叶，在空中飘舞、翻卷，摇摇摆摆地落到地面上。可是也有一些人，为数不多的一些人，却像沿着一条固定轨道运行的星星，没有风吹到它们，它们有自身的规律和轨道。我认识不少学者和沙门，但其中只有一个是这种类型的完人，我永远也忘不了。那就是戈塔马，那个活佛，那个讲经的人。每天都有成千的信徒听他讲经，听他的每一堂课，可他们全都是飘落的树叶，自己内心并没有学说和规律。"'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are the best lover," she said thoughtfully, "I ever saw. You're stronger than others, more supple, more willing. You've learned my art well, Siddhartha. At some time, when I'll be older, I'd want to bear your child. And yet, my dear, you've remained a Samana, and yet you do not love me, you love nobody. Isn't it so?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Siddhartha said nothing, and they played the game of love, one of the thirty or forty different games Kamala knew. Her body was flexible like that of a jaguar and like the bow of a hunter; he who had learned from her how to make love, was knowledgeable of many forms of lust, many secrets. For a long time, she played with Siddhartha, enticed him, rejected him, forced him, embraced him: enjoyed his masterful skills, until he was defeated and rested exhausted by her side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席特哈尔塔不出声。于是，他们玩爱情游戏，玩卡玛拉熟悉的三十种或四十种不同游戏当中的一种。她的身子柔韧如美洲豹，像猎人的弓；谁向她学过爱情，就会精通许多技巧，洞悉许多秘密。好和席特哈尔塔长久地玩耍，挑逗他，推开他，强迫他，拥抱他，为他的娴熟技巧而高兴，一直到他被征服，精疲力竭地躺在她身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
