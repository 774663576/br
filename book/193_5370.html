<div class="line_en">In a paradox of self-awareness, Langdon sensed this was death. He felt glad for it. He allowed the drifting numbness to possess him entirely. He let it carry him wherever it was he would go. His pain and fear had been anesthetized, and he did not wish it back at any price. His final memory had been one that could only have been conjured in hell.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the lapping that lulled in him a far-off sense of peace was also pulling him back. It was trying to awaken him from a dream. No! Let me be! He did not want to awaken.

The more he fought, the more the fury filtered through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那拍浪声虽然让他陷入一种遥远的宁静感，却也同时把他往回拖，想把他从梦中拖出来。不！让我继续作梦吧！他不想醒来。他感觉到一群恶魔团团围住他的极乐小天地，猛捶著要粉碎他的美梦。一堆模糊的影像打著转，种种声音狂喊。不，求求你！他愈是挣扎，那股狂暴就渗透得愈凶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The helicopter was in a dizzying dead climb. He was trapped inside. Beyond the open door, the lights of Rome looked farther away with every passing second.

But it would be falling toward a city of people.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon turned, startled. The camerlegno was not even looking at him, apparently having read Langdon's thoughts from the ghostly reflection in the windshield. Oddly, the camerlegno was no longer engrossed in his controls. His hands were not even on the throttle. The chopper, it seemed, was now in some sort of autopilot mode, locked in a climb. The camerlegno reached above his head, to the ceiling of the cockpit, fishing behind a cable-housing, where he removed a key, taped there out of view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登转身，吓了一跳。总司库根本没在看他，显然从映在挡风玻璃上幽灵似的倒影看透了他的心。怪的是，总司库不再全神贯注于那些操纵装置，他的双手现在甚至没放在速度摇杆上。看起来直升机现在似乎是转到了某种自动驾驶模式，锁定往上爬升。总司库伸手到头上方的舱门顶，探著一条束线管后方，拿出用胶带黏在那边的一根钥匙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon wondered how high they were now. Small prop planes, he knew, flew at altitudes of about four miles. This helicopterhad to be at a good fraction of that by now. Two miles up? Three? There wasstill a chance. If they timed the drop perfectly, the canister would fall only partway toward earth, exploding a safe distance over the ground and away from the chopper. Langdon looked out at the city sprawling below them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登很纳闷他们现在飞得多高了。他知道小型螺旋桨飞机最高可以飞到四哩，这架直升机到现在应该飞过一半以上了。两哩多？三哩？还有个机会，如果他们抓准丢出去的时间，罐子落地的途中就会爆炸，离地面还有一段安全的距离，而且也远离这架直升机。兰登望向舱门外，广大的城市在他们下方展开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="再高一点！再高一点！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon watched in bewilderment as the camerlegno quickly unlocked the metal cargo box bolted between the seats. He removed some sort of large, black, nylon pack. He lay it on the seat next to him. Langdon's thoughts churned. The camerlegno's movements seemed composed, as if he had a solution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登困惑地看著总司库迅速打开拴在两个座位间的金属杂物箱。他拿出一个大大的黑色尼龙包，放在隔壁的座位上。兰登的思绪翻腾，总司库的动作似乎很沉著，好像心中已经有了解答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon did not know what to think anymore. He thrust the canister to the camerlegno. "Ninety seconds!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登再也不知道该怎麽想了。他把罐子塞给总司库。「九十秒！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What the camerlegno did with the antimatter took Langdon totally by surprise. Holding the canister carefully in his hands, the camerlegno placed it inside the cargo box. Then he closed the heavy lid and used the key to lock it tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库处置那个反物质罐子的动作，完全出乎兰登的意料之外。他小心地双手拿好，放进了那个杂物箱。然后他关上沉重的盖子，用钥匙锁紧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you doing!" Langdon demanded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「你在做什麽！」兰登问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「不叫我们遇见试探。」总司库把钥匙扔出开著的窗子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The image burned in Langdon's unconscious mind, and with it came the pain. Real pain. Physical pain. Aching. Searing. He begged to be taken, to let it end, but as the water lapped louder in his ears, new images began to flash. His hell had only just begun. He saw bits and pieces. Scattered frames of sheer panic. He lay halfway between death and nightmare, begging for deliverance, but the pictures grew brighter in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个影像烙在兰登无意识的脑子裡，随之而来的是痛。真正的痛。肉体的疼痛，持续的，尖锐的。他乞求被带走，让疼痛结束，但当耳边的拍浪声变大，开始出现了一批新的影像。他看到小点和碎片。极度恐慌的散乱画面。他浮游在死亡和梦魇之间，乞求解脱，但他脑海中的影像愈来愈明亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The camerlegno then took the nylon pack and slipped his arms through the straps. He fastened a waist clamp around his stomach and cinched it all down like a backpack. He turned to a dumbstruck Robert Langdon.</div>

<div class="line_en">The antimatter canister was locked out of reach. It counted relentlessly downward as the chopper shot upward. Fifty seconds. Higher. Higher. Langdon spun wildly in the cabin, trying to make sense of what he had just seen. Forty-five seconds. He dug under seats searching for another parachute. Forty seconds. There was none! There had to be an option! Thirty-five seconds. He raced to the open doorway of the chopper and stood in the raging wind, gazing down at the lights of Rome below. Thirty-two seconds.</div>

<div class="line_en">The unbelievable choice…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="难以置信的选择……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he plummeted toward earth, Robert Langdon felt something he had not experienced since his years on the high dive -- the inexorable pull of gravity during a dead drop. The faster he fell, the harder the earth seemed to pull, sucking him down. This time, however, the drop was not fifty feet into a pool. The drop was thousands of feet into a city -- an endless expanse of pavement and concrete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="笔直朝地面落下时，罗柏．兰登感觉到某种力量，那是他以前高台跳水时从没体验过的──地心引力在致死坠落过程中那种势不可挡的拉力。他下坠得愈快，地心引力似乎就愈强，把他猛往下吸。但这回，他不是从五十迟的高台跳入泳池，而是从几千迟的空中跳入一个城市──一大片无尽绵延的柏油路和水泥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With no parachute, Robert Langdon had jumped out the door. As the night swallowed his tumbling body, the helicopter seemed to rocket off above him, the sound of its rotors evaporating in the deafening rush of his own free fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身上没有降落伞，罗柏．兰登跳出了舱门。黑夜吞噬了他翻滚的身影，直升机彷彿往他上方猛射出去，在他的自由坠落所带来的震耳风声中，螺旋桨的声音消失远去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The windshield tarp had been lying in the back of the helicopter. It was a concave rectangle -- about four yards by two -- like a huge fitted sheet… the crudest approximation of a parachute imaginable. It had no harness, only bungie loops at either end for fastening it to the curvature of the windshield. Langdon had grabbed it, slid his hands through the loops, held on, and leapt out into the void.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那块用来遮挡风玻璃的防水布，当时就放在直升机的后机舱。形状是四边内凹的长方形──大约四码宽、两迟长──像个巨大的床罩，是他所能想到最粗略近似降落伞的物品。上头没有降落伞背带，只有两端各一个橡胶绳扣环，用来扣在挡风玻璃上的。兰登抓住了那块布，双手穿过扣环抓紧，然后跳入了一片空无。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somewhere in the torrent of wind and desperation, Kohler's voice echoed from the grave… words he had spoken earlier this morning standing at CERN's free-fall tube. One square yard of drag will slow a falling body almost twenty percent. Twenty percent, Langdon now realized, was not even close to what one would need to survive a fall like this. Nonetheless, more out of paralysis than hope, he clenched in his hands the sole object he had grabbed from the chopper on his way out the door. It was an odd memento, but it was one that for a fleeting instant had given him hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在奔腾的大风和满腹绝望中，寇勒的声音从坟墓中传来……是他今天上午在欧洲核子研究中心的自由落体管前面说过的。一平方码的曳引力，可以使物体的下降速度减缓将近百分之二十。现在兰登明白，对于这样的坠落来说，百分之二十远远不足以让他活命。虽然如此，他还是两手紧抓著一件东西，与其说是怀抱希望，倒不如说是麻木了；那是他跳出机舱门前从直升机裡面匆忙抓到的唯一物品。是个纪念品，不过是那电光石火的瞬间，唯一能带给他希望的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he plummeted toward earth, there was a deep explosion somewhere above him. It seemed farther off than he had expected. Almost instantly, the shock wave hit. He felt the breath crushed from his lungs. There was a sudden warmth in the air all around him. He fought to hold on. A wall of heat raced down from above. The top of the tarp began to smolder… but held.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笔直朝地面坠下时，上方某处有个深沉的爆炸。好像比他预期得要远。然后震波几乎立刻撞上他。他觉得肺裡的气都被榨了出来。空中忽然出现一股暖流紧紧包围他。他努力握紧手，一道热气形成的大墙从天而降，防水布的上端开始闷烧……不过没破。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For an instant, Langdon felt hope. A moment later, though, that hope faded like the withdrawing heat above. Despite his straining arms assuring him that the tarp was slowing his fall, the wind still tore past his body with deafening velocity. Langdon had no doubt he was still moving too fast to survive the fall. He would be crushed when he hit the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一时之间，兰登又感觉到希望。可是片刻之后，那股希望就像上方消退的热气般又褪去了。儘管他绷紧的双手确保那块防水布可以减缓下降的速度，但风仍以震耳欲聋的速度掠过他身体。兰登很确定他还是下坠得太快，不可能生还。他落地时会摔得粉身碎骨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beneath him, the lights of Rome spread out in all directions. The city looked like an enormous starlit sky that Langdon was falling into. The perfect expanse of stars was marred only by a dark strip that split the city in two -- a wide, unlit ribbon that wound through the dots of light like a fat snake. Langdon stared down at the meandering swatch of black.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他下方，罗马城的灯光朝四面八方伸展，兰登正要落入的那个城市看起来像个被繁星点亮的庞大天空。一大片完美无瑕的星空只有一点瑕疵，就是把城市分为两半的那条暗色带子──没有灯光的宽阔长带，像一条胖蛇迂迴穿过了点点灯光。兰登往下望著那条曲折的黑色条块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mathematical figures tumbled through his brain, but he was too numb to make sense of them…one square yard of drag… 20 percent reduction of speed. All Langdon could figure was that the tarp over his head was big enough to slow him more than 20 percent. Unfortunately, though, he could tell from the wind whipping past him that whatever good the tarp was doing was not enough. He was still falling fast… there would be no surviving the impact on the waiting sea of concrete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一堆数字在他脑海裡翻腾，但他麻木得无法理解……一平方码的曳引力……减缓百分之二十的速度。兰登唯一能估计的就是头顶上这块防水布够大，减缓的速度超过百分之二十。但不幸的是，他从掠过身上的狂风也可以判断，不管这块防水布带来了什麽好处，反正都不够。他还是下坠得太快……等撞到底下等著的那一大片水泥，他就死定了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="忽然间，好像一股不期然的大浪涨到最顶点，他心中再度充满希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With almost maniacal vigor, Langdon yanked down hard with his right hand on the canopy. The tarp suddenly flapped louder, billowing, cutting right to find the path of least resistance. Langdon felt himself drifting sideways. He pulled again, harder, ignoring the pain in his palm. The tarp flared, and Langdon sensed his body sliding laterally. Not much. Butsome! He looked beneath him again, to the sinuous serpent of black. It was off to the right, but he was still pretty high. Had he waited too long? He pulled with all his might and accepted somehow that it was now in the hands of God. He focused hard on the widest part of the serpent and… for the first time in his life, prayed for a miracle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登发疯似的用力把右手的篷盖往下拽，防水布忽然拍击得更大声，鼓胀起来，往右一斜好寻找阻力更小的路径。兰登觉得自己往旁边斜飘过去，他又拉，这回更用力，无视于手掌上的疼痛。防水布摇曳了一下，兰登觉得自己的身体往横向滑动。不多，可是有一些！他再度望著下方那条弯曲的黑蛇。位于远远的右方，不过他的位置还很高。他是不是等得太久了？他使出全身力量，觉得现在一切都得靠上帝了。他专注看著那条黑蛇最宽的部份，然后……这辈子头一回，他祈求奇蹟出现。">查看中文翻译</div>
