<div class="line_en">It was a surprisingly clear afternoon and the men were climbing into the truck. Hans Hubermann had just sat down in his appointed seat. Reinhold Zucker was standing above him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个格外晴朗的下午，战友们纷纷爬上卡车。汉斯·胡伯曼坐在自己的指定座位上。赖因霍尔德·楚克尔高高地站在他身旁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Move it," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一边去。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hans was confused. The backseat was probably the most uncomfortable of the lot. It was the draftiest, the coldest. "Why?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯一头雾水。整个车厢里最不舒服的就是后排座位，那儿风最大，也最冷。“为什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bitte? Excuse me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Does it matter?" Zucker was losing patience. "Maybe I want to get off first to use the shit house."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你干吗要向那个白痴服软？”坐在他身旁的人问他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hans was quickly aware that the rest of the unit was already watching this pitiful struggle between two supposed grown men. He didn't want to lose, but he didn't want to be petty, either. Also, they'd just finished a tiring shift and he didn't have the energy to go on with it. Bent-backed, he made his way forward to the vacant seat in the middle of the truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯很快就意识到，全车人都看着他们这两个成年人可怜兮兮地争吵。他不想输，但也不想让人觉得自己婆婆妈妈。更何况他们刚刚值完班，现在累得要死，他已经没力气吵了。他弯着腰，挪到车厢中部的空座位上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The olive green truck was on its way toward the camp, maybe ten miles away. Brunnenweg was telling a joke about a French waitress when the left front wheel was punctured and the driver lost control. The vehicle rolled many times and the men swore as they tumbled with the air, the light, the trash, and the tobacco. Outside, the blue sky changed from ceiling to floor as they clambered for something to hold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="橄榄绿色的卡车行驶在路上，离营地大约还有十英里远时，布伦讷韦格正在讲一位法国女招待的笑话，这时左前轮的轮胎突然被扎破了，卡车失去了控制，翻了好几个跟斗，车厢里的士兵一边在空气、光线、垃圾和香烟中打滚，一边破口大骂。外面的天空时而在上，时而在下，士兵们拼命地想抓住什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hans lit a match and offered a share of the cigarette. "The draft back there goes straight through my ears."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯擦亮火柴，把烟分给他抽了一口。“那边风太大了，都灌到我耳朵里去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When it stopped, they were all crowded onto the right-hand wall of the truck, their faces wedged against the filthy uniform next to them. Questions of health were passed around until one of the men, Eddie Alma, started shouting, "Get this bastard off me!" He said it three times, fast. He was staring into Reinhold Zucker's blinkless eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当卡车终于停下来，所有人都挤在车厢右侧，每个人的头都贴在了身旁的人肮脏的制服上。大家互相询问有没有受伤，直到一个叫埃迪·阿尔玛的人突然开始大声喊叫：“把这个杂种从我身上挪开！”他连着喊了三遍。他正瞪着赖因霍尔德·楚克尔不再眨动的双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?" the sergeant called over from the truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说什么？”卡车边上的中士对他大喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over by a tree, a thin strip of intense pain was still opening in Hans Hubermann's leg. "It should have been me," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯·胡伯曼靠在树上，他腿上那条长长的伤口仍旧剧痛难忍。“死的本来应该是我啊。”他说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The driver, Helmut Brohmann, was sitting on the ground, scratching his head. "The tire," he explained, "it just blew." Some of the men sat with him and echoed that it wasn't his fault. Others walked around smoking, asking each other if they thought their injuries were bad enough to be relieved of duty. Another small group gathered at the back of the truck and viewed the body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="司机赫尔穆特·布罗曼正坐在地上挠头。“轮胎。”他解释说，“竟然是轮胎爆了。”有些人坐在他身旁，安慰说那不是他的错。其他人来回走动着抽烟，相互询问他们的伤是否严重到可以退伍回家。还有一小群人聚集在卡车后面看着那具尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was sitting in my seat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他坐的是我的座位。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Helmut Brohmann regained his senses and climbed back into the driver's compartment. Sideways, he tried to start the engine, but there was no kicking it over. Another truck was sent for, as was an ambulance. The ambulance didn't come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫尔穆特·布罗曼调整好心情后，重新爬回了驾驶室。他平躺着想发动引擎，但卡车没有任何反应。他们只好喊了另一辆卡车和一辆救护车过来。可是救护车没有来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They dragged each other out until only the corpse was left in the truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们互相帮忙，从车里钻了出来，直到卡车上只剩下一具尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know what that means, don't you?" said Boris Schipper. They did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们明白这是什么意思吧？”鲍里斯·席佩说。他们再明白不过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they resumed the trip back to camp, each man tried not to look down at Reinhold Zucker's openmouthed sneer. "I told you we should have turned him facedown," someone mentioned. A few times, some of them simply forgot and rested their feet on the body. Once they arrived, they all tried to avoid the task of pulling him out. When the job was done, Hans Hubermann took a few abbreviated steps before the pain fractured in his leg and brought him down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们坐上前来支援的卡车返回营地的时候，每个人都别过头，不想看到赖因霍尔德·楚克尔那咧着嘴冷笑的脸。有人说：“我早就跟你们说过了，我们应该把他反过来，让他脸朝下。”好几个人大概忘记了这件事，把脚搁在了尸体上。抵达营地后，谁都不想把他从卡车上拖下来。等事情终于办妥了，汉斯·胡伯曼才拖着疼痛难忍的腿，迈着小步从卡车上下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Hubermann. Looks like you've got away with it, doesn't it?" He was shaking his round face, smoking, and he provided a list of what would happen next. "You'll rest up. They'll ask me what we should do with you. I'll tell them you did a great job." He blew some more smoke. "And I think I'll tell them you're not fit for the LSE anymore and you should be sent back to Munich to work in an office or do whatever cleaning up needs doing there. How does that sound?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错啊，胡伯曼。看来你可以逃脱了，不是吗？”他一边吞云吐雾，一边摇晃着那张圆脸，把接下来会发生的事一样样讲给他听，“你可以好好休息休息。他们会问我该怎么给你安排去处。我会告诉他们，你的表现非常出色。”他又吐出一团团烟云。“然后我大概会说，你已经没法继续执行空袭特勤队的任务了，你会被派回慕尼黑，做点办公室工作，或者随便什么需要人手去善后的工作。听起来怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later, when the doctor examined him, he was told it was definitely broken. The sergeant was on hand and stood with half a grin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，医生检查了他的伤口，告诉他这条腿铁定已经骨折了。中士就在一旁，他脸上禁不住露出了笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unable to resist a laugh within the grimace of pain, Hans replied, "It sounds good, Sergeant."</div>
