<div class="line_en">I flew to London a few weeks later. I was covering Wimbledon, the world's premier tennis competition and one of the few events I go to where the crowd never boos and no one is drunk in the parking lot. England was warm and cloudy, and each morning I walked the treelined streets near the tennis courts, passing teenagers cued up for leftover tickets and vendors selling strawberries and cream. Outside the gate was a newsstand that sold a halfdozen colorful British tabloids, featuring photos of topless women, paparazzi pictures of the royal family, horoscopes, sports, lottery contests, and a wee bit of actual news. Their top headline of the day was written on a small chalkboard that leaned against the latest stack of papers, and usually read something like DIANA IN ROW WITH CHARLES! or GAZZA TO TEAM: GIVE ME MILLIONS!</div>

<div class="line_en">People scooped up these tabloids, devoured their gossip, and on previous trips to England, I had always done the same. But now, for some reason, I found myself thinking about Morrie whenever I read anything silly or mindless. I kept picturing him there, in the house with the Japanese maple and the hardwood floors, counting his breath, squeezing out every moment with his loved ones, while I spent so many hours on things that meant absolutely nothing to me personally: movie stars, supermodels, the latest noise out of Princess Di or Madonna or John F. Kennedy, Jr. In a strange way, I envied the quality of Morrie's time even as I lamented its diminishing supply. Why did we, bother with all the distractions we did? Back home, the O. J. Simpson trial was in full swing, and there were people who surrendered their entire lunch hours watching it, then taped the rest so they could watch more at night. They didn't know O. J. Simpson. They didn't know anyone involved in the case. Yet they gave up days and weeks of their lives, addicted to someone else's drama.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们很欢迎这些通俗小报，津津有味地读着那些小道新闻。前几次来英国时我也这么做，可这次，不知什么原因，每当我读到那些元聊的东西，我就会想起莫里。我脑子里老是出现他在那幢长着日本槭树且铺着硬木地板的房子里数着他的呼吸次数。挤出每一分钟时间去陪伴他所爱之人的情形。而我却把大量的时间花在那些对我毫无意义的事情上：什么电影明星啦，超级模特啦，有关迪公主，玛多娜或小肯尼迪的传闻啦。说来也怪，虽然我悲叹莫里来日无多的生命，但我又忌妒它的充实。我们为何要把大量的时间花在无谓的琐事上：什么电影明星啦，超级模特啦，有关迪公主，玛多娜或小肯尼迪的传闻啦。说来也怪，虽然我悲叹莫里来日无多的生命，但我又忌妒它的充实。我们为何要把大量的时间花在无谓的琐事上？O•J•辛普森的案子在美国闹得沸沸扬扬，人们为了收看这一报道而情愿放弃整个午饭的时间，还要再预录下来不及看完的部分到晚上补看。他们并不认识辛普森，他们也不认识和这件案子有关的其他人。然而他们却甘愿为此浪费掉时间，整日、整个星期地沉溺在他人的闹剧里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remembered what Morrie said during our visit: "The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记起了上次见面时莫里说过的话：“我们的文化并不让我们感到心安理得。你需要十分的坚强才能说，如果这种文化没有用，就别去接受它。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrie, true to these words, had developed his own culture-long before he got sick. Discussion groups, walks with friends, dancing to his music in the Harvard Square church. He started a project called Greenhouse, where poor people could receive mental health services. He read books to find new ideas for his classes, visited with colleagues, kept up with old students, wrote letters to distant friends. He took more time eating and looking at nature and wasted no time in front of TV sitcoms or "Movies of the Week." He had created a cocoon of human activities -- conversation, interaction, affection-and it filled his life like an overflowing soup bowl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里，就像他说的那样，建立了他自己的文化——早在他患病之前就这么做了。小组讨论，和朋友散步，去华盛顿广场的教堂跳舞自娱。他还制定了一个名叫绿屋的计划，为贫困的人提供心理治疗。他博览群书为他的课寻找新的思想内容，他走访同事们，与毕业的学生保持联系，给远方的朋友写信。他情愿花时间去享享口福和赏玩自然，而从不浪费在电视喜剧或周末电影上。他建立了一种人类活动的模式——相互交流，相互影响，相互爱护——这一模式充实着他的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had also developed my own culture. Work. I did four or five media jobs in England, juggling them like a clown. I spent eight hours a day on a computer, feeding my stories back to the States. Then I did TV pieces, traveling with a crew throughout parts of London. I also phoned in radio reports every morning and afternoon. This was not an abnormal load. Over the years, I had taken labor as my companion and had moved everything else to the side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也建立了我自己的文化：工作。我在英国干四到五份新闻媒体的工作，像小丑一样地跳来跳去。我一天在电脑上要花八个小时，把报道传送回美国；此外我还要制作电视节目，跟着摄制组走遍伦敦的每一个地方。我还要在每天的上午和下午主持听众来电直播节月。这份负担确实够重的。几年来，我一直将工作视为我的伴侣，把其它一切都抛在了脑后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Wimbledon; I ate meals at my little wooden work cubicle and thought nothing of it. On one particularly crazy day, a crush of reporters had tried to chase down Andre Agassi and his famous girlfriend, Brooke Shields, and I had gotten knocked over by a British photographer who barely muttered "Sorry" before sweeping past, his huge metal lenses strapped around his neck. I thought of something else Morrie had told me: "So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在温布尔顿，我就在小小方方的工作台上用餐，权当完成任务。有一天，一群发了疯似的记者拼命追踪阿加西和他那位有名的女友波姬•小丝，我被一个英国摄影师撞倒了，他只咕哝了一声“对不起”便跑得没了人影，他的脖子上辇着巨大的金属镜头。我不由地想起了莫里曾对我说过的另一番话：“许多人过着没有意义的生活。即使当他们在忙于一些自以为重要的事情时，他们也显得昏昏慵慵的。这是因为他们在追求一种错误的东西。你要使生活有意义，你就得献身于爱，献身于你周围的群体，去创造一种能给你目标和意义的价值观。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I flew to Detroit, arrived late in the afternoon, dragged myself home and went to sleep. I awoke to a jolting piece of news: the unions at my newspaper had gone on strike. The place was shut down. There were picketers at the front entrance and marchers chanting up and down the street. As a member of the union, I had no choice: I was suddenly, and for the first time in my life, out of a job, out of a paycheck, and pitted against my employers. Union leaders called my home and warned me against any contact with my former editors, many of whom were my friends, telling me to hang up if they tried to call and plead their case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我飞回底特律，傍晚时才到达。我拖着疲惫的身子回到家，一头倒在了床上。醒来后看到的是一则爆炸性的新闻：我那家报纸的工会举行了罢工。报社关闭了。大门口站着纠察队员，请愿者在街上游行示威。作为工会的会员，我没有选择。我突然之间、也是我生活中第一次失去了工作，失去了支票，和老板处于对立面。工会的头给我打来电话，警告我别同任何我以前的老总们接触，如果他们打电话来解释，就挂断电话。他们中有许多人是我的朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt confused and depressed. Although the TV and radio work were nice supplements, the newspaper had been my lifeline, my oxygen; when I saw my stories in print in each morning, I knew that, in at least one way, I was alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感到既困惑又沮丧。虽然我在电视台和电台的打工是一份不错的副业，但报纸始终是我的生命线，是我生命中的氧气。当我每天早上看见我写的报道见诸报端时，我便知道，至少从某个意义上说我还活着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it was gone. And as the strike continued-the first day, the second day, the third day -- there were worried phone calls and rumors that this could go on for months. Everything I had known was upside down. There were sporting events each night that I would have gone to cover. Instead, I stayed home, watched them on TV. I had grown used to thinking readers somehow needed my column. I was stunned at how easily things went on without me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在它消失了。随着罢工的继续——一天，两天，三天——不断有令人焦虑的电话和谣言传来，说这次罢工有可能持续几个月。我所熟悉的生活方式被打乱了。原来每天晚上都有体育比赛需要我去采访，现在我只能呆在家里，坐在电视机前看。我已经理所当然地认为读者是非常需要我的专栏文章的，可我吃惊地发现缺了我一切照样进行得十分顺利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the spring, we sit under a tree outside the sociology building, and in the winter, we sit by his desk, me in my gray sweatshirts and Adidas sneakers, Morrie in Rockport shoes and corduroy pants. Each time we talk, lie listens to me ramble, then he tries to pass on some sort of life lesson. He warns me that money is not the most important thing, contrary to the popular view on campus. He tells me I need to be "fully human." He speaks of the alienation of youth and the need for "connectedness" with the society around me. Some of these things I understand, some I do not. It makes no difference. The discussions give me an excuse to talk to him, fatherly conversations I cannot have with my own father, who would like me to be a lawyer.</div>
