<div class="line_en">In the days that followed, Lyra went everywhere with Mrs. Coulter, almost as if she were a daemon herself. Mrs. Coulter knew a great many people, and they met in all kinds of different places: in the morning there might be a meeting of geographers at the Royal Arctic Institute, and Lyra would sit by and listen; and then Mrs. Coulter might meet a politician or a cleric for lunch in a smart restaurant, and they would be very taken with Lyra and order special dishes for her, and she would learn how to eat asparagus or what sweetbreads tasted like. And then in the afternoon there might be more shopping, for Mrs. Coulter was preparing her expedition, and there were furs and oilskins and waterproof boots to buy, as well as sleeping bags and knives and drawing instruments that delighted Lyra's heart. After that they might go to tea and meet some ladies, as well dressed as Mrs. Coulter if not so beautiful or accomplished: women so unlike female Scholars or gyptian boat mothers or college servants as almost to be a new sex altogether, one with dangerous powers and qualities such as elegance, charm, and grace. Lyra would be dressed up prettily for these occasions, and the ladies would pamper her and include her in their graceful delicate talk, which was all about people: this artist, or that politician, or those lovers.</div>

<div class="line_en">And when the evening came, Mrs. Coulter might take Lyra to the theater, and again there would be lots of glamorous people to talk to and be admired by, for it seemed that Mrs. Coulter knew everyone important in London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜晚到来的时候，库尔特夫人也许会带她去剧院看演出。同样，那里依然会有很多魅力无穷的人，可以跟他们聊天，值得她敬佩，似乎伦敦所有的大人物库尔特夫人都认识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the intervals between all these other activities Mrs. Coulter would teach her the rudiments of geography and mathematics. Lyra's knowledge had great gaps in it, like a map of the world largely eaten by mice, for at Jordan they had taught her in a piecemeal and disconnected way: a junior Scholar would be detailed to catch her and instruct her in such-and-such, and the lessons would continue for a sullen week or so until she "forgot" to turn up, to the Scholar's relief. Or else a Scholar would forget what he was supposed to teach her, and drill her at great length about the subject of his current research, whatever that happened to be. It was no wonder her knowledge was patchy. She knew about atoms and elementary particles, and anbaromagnetic charges and the four fundamental forces and other bits and pieces of experimental theology, but nothing about the solar system. In fact, when Mrs. Coulter realized this and explained how the earth and the other five planets revolved around the sun, Lyra laughed loudly at the joke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有这些活动的时候，库尔特夫人便教她一些地理和数学的基础知识，莱拉的知识像是一张被老鼠吃掉了一大部分的世界地图，有着很大的缺陷，因为在乔丹学院，他们对她的教育零零碎碎，而且缺乏连贯性：他们会指定一个年轻的院士抓住她，给她讲某某题目，这样的课程会令人郁闷地继续一个星期左右，最后，莱拉便会“忘记”上课的事情，这让那位院士很是松了一口气。或者，某位院士会忘记该给她讲什么，于是便很长时间地给她讲自己目前正在从事的研究课题，也不管对她是否合适。这样，她的知识便毫不奇怪地非常零散。她知道原子、基本粒子、电磁电荷以及四个基本力，但对太阳系却一无所知。实际上，当库尔特夫人认识到这一点、给她解释地球和另外五大行星是怎么绕太阳公转的时候，莱拉大声笑了起来，认为这是开玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的话刚一出口，库尔特夫人的精灵便猛地抬起头，盯着她，瘦小的身躯上的金色毛发像充了电似的一下子直立起来。库尔特夫人把一只手放在他的后背上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="然而，莱拉很愿意显示自己的确掌握的某些知识。于是，当库尔特夫人给她讲电子的时候，她很在行地说：“是的，电子就是带负电的粒子，有点像尘埃，只是尘埃不带电。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, it might have been. Or else it might've been just in passing. Yes. I think that was it.

That's what it was."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可能是吧。不过也许是在路上听到的，对了，我想就是这样。那个院士，我想他是从新丹麦①来的，他在跟神父讲尘埃的事情的时候，我正好路过，我觉得有意思，于是禁不住停下来听了听。就是这样。”【注：①在小说中，作者虚构了一些地名，此为其一。但也有的文学评论家认为小说中的新丹麦是指新大陆，即美国。另见第十章和第十四章。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see," said Mrs. Coulter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来是这样，”库尔特夫人说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And finally, there were other kinds of lessons so gently and subtly given that they didn't feel like lessons at all. How to wash one's own hair; how to judge which colors suited one; how to say no in such a charming way that no offense was given; how to put on lipstick, powder, scent. To be sure, Mrs. Coulter didn't teach Lyra the latter arts directly, but she knew Lyra was watching when she made herself up, and she took care to let Lyra see where she kept the cosmetics, and to allow her time on her own to explore and try them out for herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了最后，还有其他几类课程，库尔特夫人讲得既和善又巧妙，甚至根本感觉不到是在上课。其中包括：如何洗头，如何判断什么颜色适合谁，如何礼貌地表示拒绝而又不伤害别人，如何抹口红、上粉底、洒香水。确切地说，这后几项技巧库尔特夫人并没有直接教给莱拉，但是她知道莱拉一直在观察自己怎么化妆。于是，她便有意地让莱拉看见自己把化妆品放在什么地方，并给她留出时间，让她自己摸索，自己试验。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, Pantalaimon said, "You know when all the fur stood up on her daemon? Well, I was behind him, and she grabbed his fur so tight her knuckles went white. You couldn't see. It was a long time till his fur went down. I thought he was going to leap at you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事情过后，潘特莱蒙说：“你知道她那精灵身上的毛什么时候全都竖起来了吗？嗯，我当时在他身后，她使劲抓精灵的毛，手上的关节都没了血色，可你没看见。过了好长时间，他的毛才趴下去。我当时以为他要往你身上扑呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Lyra had been living there for six weeks or so, Mrs. Coulter decided to hold a cocktail party. Lyra had the impression that there was something to celebrate, though Mrs. Coulter never said what it was. She ordered flowers, she discussed canapes and drinks with the caterer, and she spent a whole evening with Lyra deciding whom to invite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当莱拉在那里住了大约六个星期的时候，库尔特夫人决定举行一次鸡尾酒会。莱拉有一种感觉，库尔特夫人是要为什么事情搞一次庆祝，尽管她从来没有说过是什么事。她预订了鲜花，跟承办酒会的人谈鱼子酱面包和饮料的事，还和莱拉一起，花了一个晚上的时间决定邀请什么人来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Time passed, and autumn began to change into winter. From time to time Lyra thought of Jordan college, but it seemed small and quiet compared to the busy life she led now. Every so often she thought of Roger, too, and felt uneasy, but there was an opera to go to, or a new dress to wear, or the Royal Arctic Institute to visit, and then she forgot him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间一天一天地过去，到了秋末初冬的时候。莱拉常常会想起乔丹学院，但同她现在繁忙的生活相比，乔丹学院显得狭隘、安静。偶尔她还会想起罗杰，心里觉得不安，但因为她或者要去听歌剧，或者要试新衣服，或者要去皇家北极研究所，于是她又把他忘到了脑后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We must have the archbishop. I couldn't afford to leave him out, though he's the most hateful old snob. Lord Boreal is in town: he'll be fun. And the Princess Postnikova.

<div class="line_en">"She is," Lyra whispered back. "You just don't like her. Well, that's hard luck. I like her. And why would she be teaching us navigation and all that if she wasn't going to take us north?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她会去的，”莱拉低声答道，“你只不过是不喜欢她。嗯…那没办法。我喜欢她。而且，要是不打算带我们去北方，她干嘛要教我们学航海和那些东西呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra turned her back and closed her eyes. But what Pantalaimon said was true. She had been feeling confined and cramped by this polite life, however luxurious it was. She would have given anything for a day with Roger and her Oxford ragamuffin friends, with a battle in the claybeds and a race along the canal. The one thing that kept her polite and attentive to Mrs. Coulter was that tantalizing hope of going north. Perhaps they would meet Lord Asriel. Perhaps he and Mrs. Coulter would fall in love, and they would get married and adopt Lyra, and go and rescue Roger from the Gobblers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉转过身去背对着他，闭上了眼睛。但是潘特莱蒙说得对，她总是觉得自己被这种礼貌的生活限制着、约束着，不管这种生活是多么的豪华。她愿意不惜任何代价，来换取一天的时间，让她跟罗杰和牛津那些衣衫褴褛的朋友在一起，在粘土河床上打一架，沿着运河你追我赶。让她对库尔特夫人保持礼貌、任她摆布的一个原因就是她非常急切地想去北方探险。也许他们会见到阿斯里尔勋爵，也许他和库尔特夫人会彼此相爱，然后结婚并收养莱拉，再一起去把罗杰从饕餮手中救出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't so much her snappish tone as the words "in your own Home" that made Lyra resist stubbornly. Pantalaimon flew to the floor and instantly became a polecat, arching his back against her little white ankle socks. Encouraged by this, Lyra said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然她的话里带着怒气，但是让莱拉倔强地予以抵制的却是那句“在你自己家里”。潘特莱蒙飞到地板上，立刻变成一只鸡貂，用白色的小脚踝撑着地，拱起了后背。这一下给莱拉带来了勇气，她说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't finish the sentence, because Mrs. Coulter's daemon sprang off the sofa in a blur of golden fur and pinned Pantalaimon to the carpet before he could move. Lyra cried out in alarm, and then in fear and pain, as Pantalaimon twisted this way and that, shrieking and snarling, unable to loosen the golden monkey's grip. Only a few seconds, and the monkey had overmastered him: with one fierce black paw around his throat and his black paws gripping the polecat's lower limbs, he took one of Pantalaimon's ears in his other paw and pulled as if he intended to tear it off. Not angrily, either, but with a cold curious force that was horrifying to see and even worse to feel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没等她把这句话说完，库尔特夫人的精灵便像一道金光似的，从沙发上一跃而起，没等潘特莱蒙有什么反应，便把他按在地毯上。莱拉吓得大叫起来；潘特莱蒙左右扭动着身子，尖叫着，咆哮着，却无法挣脱金猴的控制，莱拉因为恐惧和疼痛而大声叫起来。仅仅几秒钟的光景，那只猴子便完全把潘特莱蒙制服了：一只黑色的手狠狠地卡住潘特莱蒙的喉咙，黑色的爪子紧紧地抓住鸡貂的下肢，另外一只爪子揪住潘特莱蒙的一只耳朵往外拽，像是要把它扯下来似的。猴子也没有愤怒，而是带着一种冷冰冰的好奇，看了令人非常恐惧，让人感到不寒而栗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra found it was quite easy to pretend to be lighthearted and charming, though she was conscious every second of Pantalaimon's disgust, and of his hatred for the golden monkey. Presently the doorbell rang, and soon the room was filling up with fashionably dressed ladies and handsome or distinguished men. Lyra moved among them offering canapes or smiling sweetly and making pretty answers when they spoke to her. She felt like a universal pet, and the second she voiced that thought to herself, Pantalaimon stretched his goldfinch wings and chirruped loudly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉发现，假装高兴迷人还是非常容易的，但每时每刻，她都了解潘特莱蒙的反感，了解他对金猴的憎恨。这时，门铃响了。很快，房间里便挤满了穿着入时的女人、英俊或高贵的男人。莱拉在他们中间走来走去，给他们鱼子酱面包，或者在他们跟她说话的时候，甜甜地微笑，优雅地回答他们的问题。她觉得自己像是一个人见人爱的宠物。她刚一有这个想法，潘特莱蒙便伸了伸他那金雀的翅膀，叽叽喳喳地大声叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She bent a little and offered her cheek. Lyra had to stand on tiptoe to kiss it.
