<div class="line_en">So, to quaint old Greenwich Village the art people soon came prowling, hunting for north windows and eighteenth-century gables and Dutch attics and low rents. Then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a "colony".</div>

He was past sixty and had a Michel- angelo's Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along with the body of an imp. Behrman was a failure in art. Forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his Mistress's robe. He had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. For several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising. He earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional. He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece. For the rest he was a fierce little old man, who scoffed terribly at softness in any one, and who regarded himself as especial mastiff-in-waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've been a bad girl, Sudie." said Johnsy. "Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was. It is a sin to want to die. You may bring a me a little broth now, and some milk with a little port in it, and -- no; bring me a hand-mirror first, and then pack some pillows about me, and I will sit up and watch you cook."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是一个坏女孩子，苏娣，”琼西说，“天意让那片最后的藤叶留在那里，以显示我有多么邪恶。想死是有罪过的。你现在就给我拿点鸡汤来，再拿点掺葡萄酒的牛奶来，再——不，先给我一面小镜子，再把枕头垫高一点，我要坐起来看你做饭。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"With good nursing you'll win." And now I must see another case I have downstairs. Behrman, his name is -- some kind of an artist, I believe. Pneumonia, too. He is an old, weak man, and the attack is acute. There is no hope for him; but he goes to the hospital today to be made more comfortable.</div>

<div class="line_en">And that afternoon Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woolen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around her, pillows and all.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have something to tell you, white mouse." she said. "Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia today in the hospital. He was ill only two days. The janitor found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain. His shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold. They couldn't imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night. And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it, and -- look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it's Behrman's masterpiece -- he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有件事要告诉你，小家伙，”她说，“贝尔曼先生今天在医院里患肺炎去世了。他只病了两天。头一天早晨，管理员发现他在自己那间房里痛得动弹不了。他的鞋子和衣服全都湿透了，冰凉冰凉的。他们无法想象在那个凄风苦雨的夜晚，他究竟去了哪里。后来他们发现一盏没有熄灭的灯，一把挪动过地方的梯子，几支扔得满地的画笔，还有一块调色板，上面涂抹着绿色和黄色的颜料，还有——亲爱的，瞧瞧窗子外面，瞧瞧墙上那最后一片藤叶。难道你没有想过，为什么风刮得那样厉害，它却从来不摇一摇、动一动吗？唉，亲爱的，这片叶子才是贝尔曼的杰作——就是在最后一片叶子掉下来的晚上，他把它画在那里的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
