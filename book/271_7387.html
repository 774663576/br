<div class="line_en">My eyes quickly caught a small change in the now-familiar scene. There was a stack of light-colored fabric on the bottom step of the porch. I loped over to investigate. Holding my breath, because the vampire smell stuck to the fabric like you wouldn't believe, I nudged the stack with my nose.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the cover of the trees, I dropped the stinking pile and shifted back to human. I shook the clothes out, snapping them against a tree to beat some of the smell from them. They were definitely guy's clothes -- tan pants and a white button-down shirt. Neither of them long enough, but they looked like they'd fit around me. Must be Emmett's. I rolled the cuffs up on the shirtsleeves, but there wasn't much I could do about the pants. Oh well.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took the clothes gingerly between my teeth -- ugh -- and carried them back to the trees.

<div class="line_cn" title="这里的变化更大了。房间又恢复了本来的面貌——几乎——就在刚才的20分钟里。大大的液晶电视被打开，音量调得低低的，屏幕上在放的是某部女性文艺片，但是似乎都没有人在看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Exhausted, I walked slowly up the Cullens' porch steps in my fancy new secondhand clothes but hesitated when I got to the door. Did I knock? Stupid, when they knew I was here. I wondered why no one acknowledged that -- told me either to come in or get lost. Whatever. I shrugged and let myself in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="心力交瘁的我，穿着华丽崭新的二手衣，慢步迈上Cullen家门廊的台阶，却在门口迟疑了。我要敲门吗？真笨，他们当然知道我来了。为什么没人注意到这点呢——应该有人告诉我应该进来或者走开。什么都好，我耸耸肩，把自己请进门去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had to admit, I felt better with some clothes to my name, even stinky ones that didn't quite fit.

No possessions, either, which wasn't bothering me too bad now, but would probably get annoying soon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rosalie was cross-legged on the ground by her head. Edward sat at the other end of the couch with Bella's burrito'ed feet in his lap. He looked up when I came in and smiled at me -- just a little twitch of his mouth -- like something pleased him.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉没有听见我进来。直到看到他看着我，她才抬眼瞥了我一眼，接着她也笑了。真的中气十足多了，她整个脸都焕发出神采。我都记不起上一次她见到我表现出这么兴高采烈是什么时候了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh." It bugged me a little, but for no good reason, so I shrugged it off. "Good. I hate repeating myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bella," the doctor said anxiously, "I heard something crack. I need to take a look."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉，”医生焦急地说。“我听见有些什么在破裂。我需要观察一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Give me a second, Carlisle," Bella panted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“给我点时间，卡莱尔。”贝拉喘着气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Blondie carried Bella swiftly up the big staircase with Carlisle and Edward right on her heels, none of them taking any notice of me standing dumbstruck in the doorway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金发女人携着贝拉很快跟随卡莱尔上了楼梯，爱德华在她右脚后跟，他们没有之中没有一个注意到我我目瞪口呆地呆在门道上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Bella was stronger now, but the thing was, too. You couldn't starve one without starving the other, and healing worked just the same. No way to win.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以贝拉现在很强壮，但那个东西也一样。你不可能在不饿死一个的情况下去饿死另外一个，康复工作也一样。没有办法取胜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bella took a deep breath. "Okay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉做了一个深呼吸：“好吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they had a blood bank and an X-ray machine? Guess the doc brought his work home with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他们有一个血库和一台X光线机？看这个医生是把他的工作带到了家里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I need to take an X-ray. There might be splinters. We don't want it to puncture anything."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我需要弄个X光片。这儿可能有碎片。我们不希望它刺穿任何东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was breaking her bones now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在她的骨头断了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rosalie lifted Bella carefully. Edward seemed like he was going to argue, but Rosalie bared her teeth at him and growled, "I've already got her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎莉小心地离开贝拉。爱德华似乎要上去争辩，但是罗莎莉对他露出牙齿低声咆哮着：“我已经给她了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Pretty sure" -- pant -- "it was a rib. Ow. Yep. Right here." She pointed to her left side, careful not to touch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那当然——”贝拉一直在喘气。“是肋骨。噢！是的，是这里。”她指着她的左侧，小心翼翼地不碰着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was too tired to follow them, too tired to move. I leaned back against the wall and then slid to the ground. The door was still open, and I pointed my nose toward it, grateful for the clean breeze blowing in. I leaned my head against the jamb and listened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我太累了，无法跟随他们，真的太累了，无法移动。我背靠着墙，然后下滑到地面下。门仍旧开着，我把我的鼻子凑近它，感激此时能有清爽的微风吹进来。我把脑袋斜靠在门框上然后听着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“累了。为什么你不上楼和其他人一起？”我反击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Headache," she answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“挺头痛的。”她回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I snorted. Normal vampires.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我哼了一声。正常的吸血鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice was a tiny little thing. 'Bout the size of one of my arms. She looked even smaller now, sort of hunched in on herself. Her small face was pinched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝实在是一个小东西，可以和我的一直胳臂较量一下。她自己有几分直觉，即便这样她看上去似乎更小了。她的笑容是痛苦的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why don't you move, then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么你没有动呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not the normal ones."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不是正常的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you want a pillow?" Alice asked me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想要一个枕头吗？”爱丽丝问我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I rolled my head around to look at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我推起我的脑袋去看她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could hear the sound of the X-ray machinery upstairs. Or maybe I just assumed that's what it was. And then the lightest of footsteps coming down the stairs. I didn't look to see which vampire it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能听见楼上X光线机的声音，又或许我只是假定那就是这个。然后轻柔的脚步声从楼上走下来。我没有看看是哪个吸血鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"S'not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Vampires get headaches?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“吸血鬼会头痛？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That doesn't look comfortable," she observed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这看上去可不是很舒服。”她指出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," I mumbled. What was with the pushy hospitality? It was creeping me out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”我喃喃道。那么殷勤好客是为什么？我只想偷偷溜出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So how come you're never with Bella anymore?" I asked, making the question an accusation. It hadn't occurred to me before, because my head had been full of other crap, but it was weird that Alice was never around Bella, not since I'd been here. Maybe if Alice were by her side, Rosalie wouldn't be. "Thought you two were like this." I twisted two of my fingers together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以你就不会再与贝拉一起了？”我问道，给问题带上了指控。在之前我从未想到过，因为我的脑袋充满了垃圾，但是爱丽丝不在贝拉身边真的挺古怪，并不是当我在这儿之后。如果爱丽丝在她的身边，罗莎莉就不会了。“谢谢你们两个。”我把我的两个手指拧在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我皱起眉头。我相当肯定我现在太累了，真的不能理解她的话。我让我的脑袋重新晃回新鲜的空气里然后闭上眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't see it," she told me, though she might have been talking to herself. For all she knew, I was already gone. "I can't see anything about it. Just like you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不能看见它，”她告诉我，然而就像是在对她自己说。对于所有她所知道的，我已经走了。“我无法看见关于它的任何事，就像你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ah, someone else who felt like I did. It was pretty easy to recognize. She said the word grudgingly, the way Edward did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈，有其他人像我一样想了。这倒挺容易同意她的发言。她不大情愿地说着这些词，就是那种爱德华用的方式。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not Bella, really," she amended. "The… fetus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是贝拉，说实话。”她纠正。“是……胎儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I flinched, and then my teeth ground together. I didn't like being compared to the creature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我畏惧了，接着我的牙齿磨在了一起。我不喜欢和生物比较。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bella gets in the way. She's all wrapped around it, so she's… blurry. Like bad reception on a TV -- like trying to focus your eyes on those fuzzy people jerking around on the screen. It's killing my head to watch her. And I can't see more than a few minutes ahead, anyway. The… fetus is too much a part of her future. When she first decided… when she knew she wanted it, she blurred right out of my sight. Scared me to death."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉以这种方式来获得。她已经完全地被它缠绕了，所以她……模糊不清。就像一台接受器坏掉的电视节——就像调焦你的眼睛放在模糊的人上然后猛地一拉屏幕。要看见她只会指我的脑子精疲力尽。我不能在一瞬间之前看见更多的东西，任何方式。这个……胎儿占了她未来的相当大的一部分。当她一开始决定……当她知道她需要它，她在我的视线里就模糊不清了。把我吓死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was dreaming that I was really thirsty. And there was a big glass of water in front of me -- all cold, you could see the condensation running down the sides.

<div class="line_en">I groaned and opened my eyes. The skies were dull gray -- it was daytime, but no clue as to when. Maybe close to sunset -- it was pretty dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我呻吟着睁开了眼。天空是沉闷的灰色——现在是白天，但是不知道是什么时候，也许是接近日落——天空非常暗淡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pain in my nose woke me up enough to remember where I'd fallen asleep. The smell was pretty fierce, considering that my nose wasn't actually inside the house. Ugh. And it was noisy. Someone was laughing too loud. A familiar laugh, but one that didn't go with the smell. Didn't belong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵肆意的笑声，但那个人没有随着气味离开。不是我们的成员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I rolled over and wrenched myself into a sitting position. In the process, I figured out where the smell was coming from. Someone had stuffed a wide feather pillow under my face. Probably trying to be nice, I'd guess. Unless it'd been Rosalie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我翻转过来调整着坐姿。在这个过程中，我找到了气味的来源。有人在在我脸下塞了一个装满羽毛的枕头。我猜想着那可能会试图很好。除非那是罗莎莉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Things hadn't changed too much, except that now Bella was sitting up in the middle of the sofa, and the IV was gone. Blondie sat at her feet, her head resting against Bella's knees. Still gave me chills to see how casually they touched her, though I guess that was pretty brain-dead, all things considered. Edward was on one side of her, holding her hand. Alice was on the floor, too, like Rosalie. Her face wasn't pinched up now. And it was easy to see why -- she'd found another painkiller.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="情形并没有发生多大改变，除了现在贝拉坐在沙发的正中央，而监视器也已经撤走了。那个金发芭比就坐在她脚边，头靠在贝拉的膝盖上。看到他们如此随便地对待她的画面还是不禁让我打了个寒颤。爱德华坐在她的一边，握着她的手。爱丽丝也像罗莎莉一样坐在地上，也不像刚才那样苦着脸。要知道原因很容易——她找到了另一片止痛片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"About time," Blondie mumbled from not too far away. "The chainsaw impersonation was getting a little tired."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="塞思看到我的表情，赶忙解释说。“是啊，杰克，我是来看看你是不是一切都好，因为你后来就一直没有变身回去过了。利亚开始担心，我告诉她也许你变成人形睡着了，但是你知道她的性格的。不管怎么样，他们这里吃的应有尽有，天哪，”——他转向了爱德华——“伙计，你还会做饭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was sitting on Bella's other side, his arm slung carelessly over her shoulders, an overflowing plate of food on his lap.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Speaking of hunting," he began in a somber tone. "That's going to be an issue for my family. I understand that our previous truce is inoperative at the moment, so I wanted your advice. Will Sam be hunting for us outside of the perimeter you've created? We don't want to take a chance with hurting any of your family -- or losing any of ours. If you were in our shoes, how would you proceed?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是关于狩猎的事，”他幽幽地开始讲述起来。“我们全家想要了解一些情况。我知道我们过去达成的停战协定目前正处于无效阶段，所以我想听听你的意见。山姆会不会在你们所划定的范围以外的区域追捕我们呢？我们不想在任何情况下猎杀你的族人——或者失去我们的一份子。如果你站在我们的立场，你会怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Carlisle asking, so when I turned around again, my face was probably less disrespectful than it would have been if anyone else had stopped me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是卡莱尔叫住了我，所以当我再次把头转过来的时候，没有像其他人叫住我的时候显得那么不耐烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlisle approached me while Esme drifted off toward the other room. He stopped a few feet away, just a little bit farther away than the normal space between two humans having a conversation. I appreciated him giving me my space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔向我走来的时候，正好Esme正从另一间房间里出来。他在离我几尺远的地方站定，通常情况下这样的谈话距离稍嫌远了点，但是我很感激他能够留给我足够的空间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a risk," I said, trying to ignore the other eyes I felt on me and to talk only to him. "Sam's calmed down some, but I'm pretty sure that in his head, the treaty is void. As long as he thinks the tribe, or any other human, is in real danger, he's not going to ask questions first, if you know what I mean. But, with all that, his priority is going to be La Push. There really aren't enough of them to keep a decent watch on the people while putting out hunting parties big enough to do much damage. I'd bet he's keeping it close to home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是个冒险，”我努力无视其他人投射在我身上的目光，只专注和他的谈话。“山姆已经冷静下来一些了，但是我很清楚在他的认识当中，条约已经无效了。只要他认为部落或者其他人类是真的处在危险之中，他是不会先三思而后行的，如果你知道我指的是什么。但是，话又说回来，他优先考虑的是拉普西。他们没有充足的人手既要看护人民又要组织起具有破坏力量的狩猎队伍。我敢说他的活动范围不会离保留地很远。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A moment, Jacob?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“能借用一点时间吗，雅各布？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned away, a little surprised, when he threw it back at me like that. What would I know about being in a bloodsucker's expensive shoes? But, then again, I did know Sam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他的问题直白地向我抛过来的时候，我向后仰了仰身子，显得有些受宠若惊。要我站在如此金贵的吸血鬼的立场上说话，我怎么可能知道该怎么办。而且，再说了，我也不了解山姆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I guess I'd say, go out together, just in case. And probably you should go in the day, 'cause we'd be expecting night. Traditional vampire stuff. You're fast -- go over the mountains and hunt far enough away that there's no chance he'd send anyone that far from home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以要我说的话，你们集体行动，以防万一。而且你们也许应该白天行动，因为我们通常会认为是晚上。那是吸血鬼的传统习性。你们的速度很快——可以翻山越岭，去偏远的地方狩猎。他一定不会派谁去到一个离家那么遥远的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And leave Bella behind, unprotected?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道把贝拉一个人留在后方，没有一点保护？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlisle nodded thoughtfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔若有所思地点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlisle laughed, and then his face was serious again. "Jacob, you can't fight against your brothers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔大笑起来，随后又恢复了本来的严肃表情。“雅各布，你不可以与你的弟兄们为敌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My eyes tightened. "I'm not saying it wouldn't be hard, but if they were really coming to kill her -- I would be able to stop them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我正色回答说，“我可没说这很容易，但是如果他们真是来杀死她的话——我可以阻止他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I snorted. "What are we, chopped liver?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我咆哮起来。“那我们是谁，无名小卒吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carlisle shook his head, anxious. "No, I didn't mean that you would be… incapable. But that it would be very wrong. I can't have that on my conscience."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡莱尔摇摇头，无不担忧地说。“不，我并不是说你……无法胜任。但是这样就会铸成大错。我的良心会受到谴责的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wouldn't be on yours, Doc. It would be on mine. And I can take it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不必过意不去，医生。是我会受到良心的谴责。而我也会承担这一切。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Jacob. We will make sure that our actions don't make that a necessity." He frowned thoughtfully "We'll go three at a time," he decided after a second. "That's probably the best we can do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行，雅各布。我们必须确认我们的行为不会造成那种必要。”他皱起眉头来思考。“我们一次去3个，”片刻过后，他下定决心。“那也许是我们能想到的最好办法了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The ones that disappear," Alice said, nodding. "Easy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那些消失的路就是不能选的，”爱丽丝点着头说。“那很简单。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We've got some extra abilities that will even it up. If Edward is one of the three, he'll be able to give us a few miles' radius of safety."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们还有些额外的特殊能力来弥补人数的不足。如果爱德华在这3个人里面，那么以他为半径的几英里范围内就可以确保是否安全。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know, Doc. Dividing down the middle isn't the best strategy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不明白，医生。把人数减半并不是一个好的策略。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward, who had gone all tense with Carlisle's first plan, loosened up. Bella was staring unhappily at Alice, that little crease between her eyes that she got when she was stressed out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为卡莱尔最初的提议而一直浑身紧张的爱德华，现在终于松了一口气。贝拉心事重重地看着爱丽丝，每当她倍感压力的时候，眉宇间就会拧出一个小疙瘩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We both glanced at Edward. His expression had Carlisle backtracking quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们双双看向爱德华。但他的表情让卡莱尔很快就收回了目光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's got blankets," I snapped at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她已经有毯子了，”我打消了他的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sure there are other ways, too," Carlisle said. Clearly, there was no physical need strong enough to get Edward away from Bella now. "Alice, I would imagine you could see which routes would be a mistake?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信一定还有其他的办法，”卡莱尔说。很明显，这个节骨眼上已经没有什么其他生理上的需求能让他离开Bella身边了。“爱丽丝，你是不是可以看见选择哪条路会是个错误？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure, Jake. I'll phase back soon as I'm done. Unless…" he hesitated, looking at Bella. "Do you need me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没问题，杰克。我一休整好就会立刻变身的。除非……”他欲言又止，看看贝拉。“你需要我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay, then," I said. "That's settled. I'll just be on my way. Seth, I'll expect you back on at dusk, so get a nap in there somewhere, all right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，那么，”我说。“那就解决了。我差不多该走了。塞思，我希望你能在黄昏的时候回来，所以先去打个盹儿，好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Esme flitted back in the room, a big covered dish in her hands. She stopped hesitantly just behind Carlisle's elbow, her wide, dark gold eyes on my face. She held the dish out and took a shy step closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，埃斯梅“倏”地出现在房间里，手里托着个大大的有罩的盘子。她犹犹豫豫地躲在卡莱尔身后，用她那汪大大的，深邃的金色眼眸瞧着我的脸。她害羞地向前走了一步，伸手将盘子递给我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm fine, Seth, thanks," Bella said quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很好，塞思，谢谢，”贝拉立刻接嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jeez.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的天哪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Uh, sure, sure," I mumbled. "I guess. Maybe Leah's still hungry or something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恩，好的，好的，”我支吾着说。“我猜，利亚现在也一定还饿着呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jacob," she said quietly. Her voice wasn't quite so piercing as the others'. "I know it's… unappetizing to you, the idea of eating here, where it smells so unpleasant. But I would feel much better if you would take some food with you when you go. I know you can't go home, and that's because of us. Please -- ease some of my remorse. Take something to eat." She held the food out to me, her face all soft and pleading. I don't know how she did it, because she didn't look older than her mid-twenties, and she was bone pale, too, but something about her expression suddenly reminded me of my mom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雅各布，”她温柔贤淑地说到。她说话的音色不像其他人那样刺耳尖锐。“我知道这有些……不太合你的胃口，忍受这样的味道在这里吃饭。但是如果你在走的时候能够带一些食物在身上，我会觉得好过多了。我知道你不能回家，那全怪我们。请，减轻些我的罪恶感。打包一些带着吃吧。”她将食物递到我面前，神情柔和，充满恳求。我不知道她是怎么做到的，因为她外表看起来一定不会超过25岁，也同样白白净净的，但是她神情中有某些东西却突然让我想起了我母亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I reached out and took the food with one hand, holding it away, at arm's length. I'd go dump it under a tree or something. I didn't want her to feel bad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我单手接过食物，伸直了手臂端着盘子。我准备把它丢弃在某棵树下或者什么地方。我不想伤她的心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Um, thank you," I said. My face felt hot -- hotter than usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“额，谢谢，”我的脸在发烫——比平时都要烫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't look at him to see if he was in agreement. He'd better be in agreement. Bloodsucker owed me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有去看他是不是同意这样做了。他不同意也得同意，吸血鬼欠我的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I remembered Edward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我想起了爱德华。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Jacob," Esme said, smiling at me. How did a stone face have dimples, for crying out loud?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，雅各布，”埃斯米笑着对我说。一张石头脸怎么也会有酒窝呢，真难以置信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I inhaled deeply through my nose, and then realized, too late, that that was not a good idea. I winced. "Maybe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我用鼻子深深地吸了一口气，然后认识到，太晚了，那并不是个好主意。我畏缩起来。“也许吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"On it," I muttered, and then I ducked out the door before anyone could guilt me into anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正准备去呢，”我喃喃地说，趁着任何人再让我感到愧疚之前赶紧闪出门外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Don't you say anything to her! Let her think I ate it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你可什么都别和她说啊！让她觉得我吃过就可以了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Uh, I don't know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“额，我不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was the problem with hanging out with vampires -- you got used to them. They started messing up the way you saw the world. They started feeling like friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是和吸血鬼一起待的时间久了会发生的问题——你会习惯他们。他们开始混淆你的世界观，他们让你觉得像朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pressed her lips together, like she was trying not to smile. "Please? I might get cold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的两片唇紧紧地抿在一起，像是要屏住笑出来一样。“求你了？我可能会冷的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jacob?" Esme asked. I backed toward the door as she continued; she took a few steps after me. "I left a basket of clothes on the porch. They're for Leah. They're freshly washed -- I tried to touch them as little as possible." She frowned. "Do you mind taking them to her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雅各布？”埃斯米在我向门口退去的时候追了几步，继续对我说。“我在门廊上留了一个篮子，里面全是衣服。那是为利亚准备的。它们才洗过——我尽量不去碰它们。”她皱皱眉，“你介意带去给她吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Will you come back later, Jake?" Bella asked as I tried to make a run for it.</div>
