<div class="line_en">"Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who," said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project, and began pulling on their protective gloves. "But I still don't get why Dumbledore's showing you all this. I mean, it's really interesting and everything, but what's the point?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had Herbology first thing the following morning. He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend's brutal wind had died out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天上午，哈利的第一节课是草药课。吃早饭的时候，他因为怕别人听见，没能把邓布利多给他上课的内容告诉罗恩和赫敏。当他们穿过一片片菜地朝暖房走去时，他才把事情的经过一五一十地告诉了他们。周末的凶狠狂风终于平息了，但是那种怪异的浓雾又回来了，他们用了比平常更多的时间才找到上课的那座暖房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, it was quite fun, really," said Hermione, now putting on protective goggles. "I mean, he drones on about famous exploits a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he's so well connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，其实挺好玩的，”赫敏一边戴上防护眼镜一边说道，“我是说，他虽然没完没了地唠叨他以前那些学生多么出名，而且明显是在讨好麦克拉根，因为麦克拉根认识许多头面人物，不过，他给我们吃了一些很美味的东西，还介绍我们认识了格韦诺格·琼斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know, I don't think I'll be having any of these in my garden when I've got my own place," said Ron, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.</div>

<div class="line_en">It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in Hermione's hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like Neville's. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="残根立刻活了起来，长长的刺藤从顶上蹿出来，在空中甩来甩去。其中一根缠住了赫敏的头发上，罗恩赶紧用一把整枝剪刀把它打了回去。哈利总算抓住了两根藤蔓，挽在一起打了个结。这些解手般的枝条中间露出了一个小洞。赫敏勇敢地把手臂插进洞里，洞口立刻像捕鼠夹一样咬住了她的肘部。哈利和罗恩拼命地拖拽、扭动那些藤蔓，让洞口重新张开了，赫敏总算把胳膊从里面挣脱出来，手里抓着一个像纳威弄到的那种荚果。顿时，那些刺藤全部缩了进去，布满节疤的残根静静地躺在那里，像一截毫无生气的死木头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anyway," said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them, "Slughorn's going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there's no way you'll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“反正，”赫敏继续着刚才被打断的谈话，就好像没有遭到树桩袭击似的，“斯拉格霍恩还要举办一个圣诞舞会，哈利，这次你可没有办法逃脱了，因为他特意叫我看看你哪一天晚上有空，这样他就肯定能把晚会安排在一个你能来的晚上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, "And this is another party just for Slughorn's favorites, is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利叫苦不迭。罗恩正在用两只手按着荚果，想把它的汁液挤进碗里，听了这话，他猛地站起来，使出吃奶的劲儿挤压荚果，一边气呼呼地说：“这个晚会又是专门招待斯拉格霍恩的那些宠儿的吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pod flew out from under Ron's fingers and hit the green house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout's head and knocking off her old, patched hat.

<div class="line_cn" title="“‘鼻涕虫俱乐部’，”罗恩用马尔福特有的那种讥讽口吻说，“真难听。喂，我希望你在晚会上玩得开心。你为什么不跟麦克拉根交朋友呢，这样斯拉格霍恩就能把你们封为鼻涕虫国王和王后——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">""Reparo,"' he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry's presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of "Flesh-Eating Trees of the World" to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恢复如初！”他赶紧用魔杖捅捅碎片，念了一句咒语，碗立刻自动粘合，恢复了原来的样子。但是，碗被砸碎的声音似乎惊醒了罗恩和赫敏，他们这才意识到哈利的存在。赫敏显得很慌乱，立刻开始在她那本《食肉树大全》里查找给疙瘩藤的荚果挤汁的正确方法。罗恩有点不好意思，但似乎心里美滋滋的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump. It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was not sure how he felt about it… He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up? Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And then, what if they didn't split up? What if they became like Bill and Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence, so that he was shut out for good?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把碗里的荚果递给了赫敏，他和罗恩一起重新戴好防护眼镜，再一次埋头对付着那棵疙瘩藤。他其实并不怎么吃惊，哈利一边跟想要掐住他脖子的刺藤扭打着，一边转开了心思。他早就模模糊糊地知道这件事早晚会发生。但是他不清楚自己对此会有什么感觉……如今他和秋·张尴尬得看都不敢看对方一眼，更不用说互相交谈了。如果罗恩和赫敏开始谈恋爱，然后又闹分手，那可怎么办呢？他们的友谊能经得起这番折腾吗？哈利想起三年级时罗恩和赫敏有几个星期互相不说话，他不得不两边周旋，给他们调解，搞得苦不堪言。还有，如果他们最后没有分手呢？如果他们变得像比尔和芙蓉那样，别人在他们面前都会感到尴尬、难以忍受，结果他就只好永远被排斥在外呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

Although Harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual.

On the other hand, he had to do what was best for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.</div>

There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们俩在说些什么呀？”哈利问，一边转身去挂他的球袍，这样他们俩就看不见他脸上得意的笑容了。“你完全清楚我们在说什么！”赫敏声音尖利地说，“你早饭的时候往罗恩的南瓜汁里搀了幸运药水！福灵剂！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't put it in!" said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. "I wanted Ron to think I'd done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking." He looked at Ron. "You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有把它搀进去！”哈利说着，忍不住绽开了笑容。他把手伸进外衣的口袋，掏出赫敏早上看见他拿在手里的那个小瓶。满满一瓶金黄色的药水，塞子仍然用蜡封得死死的。“我想让罗恩以为我搀了药水，所以，我知道你在旁边看着，就假装这么做了。”他看着罗恩。“你每个球都能救起来，是因为你自己感觉运气好。你是靠自己的能力做到的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. "You added Felix Felicis to Ron's juice this morning, that's why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!"</div>

<div class="line_en">But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn's Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利在格兰芬多的庆祝晚会上没有看见赫敏。他赶到时，晚会正在热烈地进行着。人们看到他进来，又爆发出一片掌声和欢呼声，祝贺的人群很快就把他团团围住了。他没有能够马上去找罗恩。克里维兄弟俩想写一篇极为详细的比赛分析，他好不容易才摆脱了他们。接着一大群女生又把他围在中间，不管他说什么没趣儿的话，她们都放声大笑，还一个劲儿地冲他挤眉弄眼，他费了好大工夫才脱了身。最后，他总算甩掉了罗米达·万尼——她强烈地暗示希望跟哈利一起去参加斯拉格霍恩的圣诞晚会。哈利躲闪着朝饮料桌走去时，迎面撞上了金妮，侏儒蒲阿囡趴在她的肩膀上，克鲁克山眼巴巴地跟在她脚边喵喵地叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Looking for Ron?" she asked, smirking. "He's over there, the filthy hypocrite."</div>

She was sitting on the teacher's desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just conjured out of midair.
