<div class="line_en">The cathedral was packed with people as the coronation ceremony began. An orchestra played and a choir sang while the royal procession walked down the very long center aisle. The bishop led the way, followed by Elsa, looking regal and serious, and finally Anna, holding the train of Elsa's dress.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, at the coronation ball, Elsa and Anna stood side by side in a long receiving line at the entrance to the Great Hall. Elsa felt relaxed, almost content, now that the most difficult part of Coronation Day was over.

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," Anna said in surprise. A smile spread across her face. Her sister had actually spoken to her! "You look beautiful-er," Anna replied. Then she realized how strange that had sounded and blurted out an explanation. "Not that you're fuller. No. Just more beautiful!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。”安娜惊讶地回答道，但脸上却满是笑容。她姐姐终于跟她说话了！“你看上去肥常美。”安娜回答说。说完她意识到这听起来有些别扭，便不假思索地解释说：“我不是说你肥，你一点也不肥。你是非常美！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa grinned. "Thank you." Then she looked out at the crowded ballroom. "So this is what a party looks like?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莎咧嘴笑了，说道：“谢谢。”然后她看着人头攒动的舞厅，问道：“派对就是这样的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜所有人都来了，”艾莎说道，“什么味道这么香？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anna could hardly believe that Elsa was treating her so kindly. She was about to say more to her sister, but just then, a guest stepped up to be presented to the new queen and the princess. "The Duke of Weaseltown," a royal attendant announced. "Weselton," the Duke corrected him. Then he bowed his head. "As your closest partner in trade, it seems only fitting that I offer you your first dance as queen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜几乎不敢相信艾莎待她这么温柔。她正要继续跟姐姐说话时，一位客人走上前来向新晋女王和公主问候。“这位是猥琐屯公爵。”一位侍者介绍道。“威斯顿。”公爵纠正说。说完他点头致意：“作为贵国最密切的贸易伙伴，我想我最适合邀请您跳加冕后的第一支舞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both of them caught a whiff of a sweet aroma wafting across the room. "Chocolate!" they exclaimed at the same time. Then they looked at each other and started laughing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa stiffened and clasped her gloved hands together. "Thank you," she said. "But I don't dance." The Duke looked offended, so Elsa quickly nudged Anna forward. "But my sister is a marvelous dancer." Anna was a little startled, but she allowed the Duke to lead her to the dance floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莎严肃起来，戴着手套的双手紧紧握在了一起。“谢谢，”她说道，“不过我不跳舞。”公爵看上去有些尴尬，这时艾莎把安娜推向前：“但我妹妹是舞蹈高手。”安娜有些不知所措，但还是接受了公爵的邀请，跟他一起走进舞池。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, the Duke was a horrible dancer. He couldn't seem to take one step without crushing Anna's toes. As he bobbed up and down, his toupee bounced back and forth on his head -- and he never stopped talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可惜公爵跳舞糟糕透顶，几乎步步都踩到安娜的脚。他跳来跳去，假发也在他头上动来动去——而且他还一直说个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bump-be-dump-bah! Look at me!" he crowed. "This certainly makes up for being shut out for twelve years for no reason. Do you know the reason?" he asked Anna. "No? Well, watch this: like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“梆梆－当当！快看我！”他高声说道，“这绝对能够弥补十二年来被无端拒之门外的损失。你知道封锁城堡大门的原因吗？”他问安娜。“不知道？好吧，看我这一步：我就像长了一张猴子脸的鸡，轻舞飞扬！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anna cringed as the Duke danced around her like a dying peacock. Then she caught sight of Elsa watching from the side of the room, barely able to keep from laughing. Anna shot Elsa a number of "help me" looks, but there was no way out of it. She was forced to finish the dance, much to Elsa's amusement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜有些尴尬，公爵围着她跳舞，活像一只垂死的孔雀。她看到艾莎在舞厅一边看着，笑弯了腰。安娜向艾莎比画着求助的手势，但还是没办法脱身。为了艾莎高兴，她不得不跳完这支舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
