<div class="line_en">I was really excited because I got an invitation to Savanna's Halloween party.</div>

<div class="line_en">Savanna is probably the most popular girl in the school. All the boys like her. All the girls want to be friends with her. She was the first girl in the grade to actually have a "boyfriend." It was some kid who goes to MS 281, though she dumped him and started dating Henry Joplin, which makes sense because the two of them totally look like teenagers already.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway, even though I'm not in the "popular" group, I somehow got invited, which is very cool. When I told Savanna I got her invitation and would be going to her party, she was really nice to me, though she made sure to tell me that she didn't invite a lot of people, so I shouldn't go around bragging to anyone that I got invited. Maya didn't get invited, for instance. Savanna also made sure to tell me not to wear a costume. It's good she told me because, of course, I would have worn a costume to a Halloween party -- not the unicorn costume I made for the Halloween Parade, but the Goth girl getup that I'd worn to school. But even that was a no-no for Savanna's party. The only negative about my going to Savanna's party was that now I wouldn't be able to go the parade and the unicorn costume would be wasted. That was kind of a bummer, but okay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎么样，虽然我不在“受欢迎”之列，但莫名其妙受到邀请，感觉还蛮好的。当我告诉萨凡娜，我收到了她的请柬并打算去参加她的派对时，她对我非常亲热，不过她要我切记，她邀请的人不多，就不要到处吹嘘，闹得人人皆知。比如，玛雅就没有得到邀请。萨凡娜还明确告诉我不要化装。幸好她跟我说了，否则，我当然会化装去参加万圣节派对——不是专门为万圣节游行做的独角兽服饰，而是学校里的那套哥特少女装。但是，即使穿这一身，萨凡娜的派对也不准许。我去参加萨凡娜的派对，唯一不好的就是不能参加游行了，独角兽的服装也浪费了。这有点糟糕，不过还好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't even know what she was talking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我压根儿不知道她在说什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, the first thing that happened when I got to her party was that Savanna greeted me at the door and asked: "Where's your boyfriend, Summer?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，我来到她的派对，遇到的第一件事情是她站在门口迎接我，问：“你的男朋友呢，萨默尔？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's not my boyfriend," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不是我男朋友。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess he doesn't have to wear a mask at Halloween, right?" she added. And then I knew she was talking about August.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想万圣节他用不着戴面具，对吗？”她补充说。这下我明白了，她说的是奥古斯特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were about fifteen kids there: all of them were popular kids from either Savanna's group or Julian's group. I guess they've all kind of merged into one big supergroup of popular kids, now that some of them have started dating each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大概有十五个同学在那里。他们都是很有人气的学生，要么来自萨凡娜的圈子，要么来自朱利安的圈子。我想，在某种程度上他们恐怕已经合并成一个超级人气大圈子了，因为他们中已经有人开始互相约会了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know. I'm just kidding!" She kissed my cheek (all the girls in her group kissed each other's cheeks now whenever they said hello), and threw my jacket on a coatrack in her hallway. Then she took me by the hand down the stairs to her basement, which is where the party was. I didn't see her parents anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，只是开个玩笑！”她亲了一下我的脸颊（她那个圈子里的女孩无论什么时候打招呼都互相亲脸颊），把我的夹克扔到走廊的衣帽架上。然后她牵着我的手，下了楼梯来到地下室，派对在那里举行。我没看到她父母。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't even know there were so many couples. I mean, I knew about Savanna and Henry, but Ximena and Miles? And Ellie and Amos? Ellie's practically as flat as I am.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know, Summer," said Savanna, "you would be a lot more popular if you didn't hang out with him so much. I'm going to be completely honest with you: Julian likes you. He wants to ask you out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在笑，但我一点也不想笑。“你难道不知道吗，萨默尔，”萨凡娜说，“如果你不是老跟他在一起玩，你会更受欢迎。就实话告诉你吧，朱利安喜欢你，他想约你出去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, about five minutes after I got there, Henry and Savanna were standing next to me, literally hovering over me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="反正，我到了才五分钟，亨利和萨凡娜便站到我身边，几乎恐吓起我来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So, we want to know why you hang out with the Zombie Kid so much," said Henry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的，我们想知道为什么你成天跟僵尸小子在一起玩。”亨利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's not a zombie," I laughed, like they were making a joke. I was smiling but I didn't feel like smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不是僵尸。”我打哈哈地说，当他们在开玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Um… yeah, I guess. Yeah, he's cute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我想是的。是的，他挺帅的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He does?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you think he's cute?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得他帅吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know." I nodded. "Thank you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，”我点点头说，“谢谢你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you have to choose who you want to hang out with," Savanna said. She was talking to me like a big sister would talk to a little sister. "Everyone likes you, Summer. Everyone thinks you're really nice and that you're really, really pretty. You could totally be part of our group if you wanted to, and believe me, there are a lot of girls in our grade who would love that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你得选择一下，到底想跟谁在一起。”萨凡娜说。她跟我说话的时候，就像一个大姐姐对小妹妹说话一样。“萨默尔，大家都喜欢你。大家都觉得你非常好，而且非常非常漂亮。只要你愿意，你完全可以成为我们圈子里的一员，相信我，这是我们年级很多女孩都梦寐以求的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're welcome," she answered. "You want me to tell Julian to come and talk to you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别客气，”她回答道，“你想让我叫朱利安过来跟你谈谈吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
