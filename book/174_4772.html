<div class="line_en">On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个晚上，岛上的主力正在进行着以下的部署：遗失的孩子守望着彼得，海盗守望着遗失的孩子，印第安人守望着海盗，野兽守望着印第安人。他们全都绕着岛团团转，可是，谁也碰不上谁，因为他们行动的速度是相等的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除孩子外，全都怀着杀心，要看流血。孩子们通常也爱看流血，不过今晚他们是来欢迎队长的。岛上的孩子的数目时常变动，因为有的被杀，或其他缘故；他们眼看就要长大的时候——这是不合乎规定的，彼得就把他们饿瘦了，直到饿死。不过眼下他们是六个人，那对孪生兄弟算两个人。我们现在假设是伏在甘蔗林里，窥视着他们。他们排成单行，一个个手按着刀柄，偷偷地向前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething with life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不在的时候，岛上变得怪冷清的。仙子们早晨多睡一个小时，野兽们照看着它们的幼崽，印第安人大吃大喝整整六天六夜，遗失的孩子们和海盗相遇，只是咬着大拇指互相对视。可是彼得一回来，他最恨死气沉沉，于是他们又全都活跃起来了。要是你把耳朵贴在地上，你就会听见，整个岛都沸腾着生机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool (for doing her mischief), and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys. 'Ware Tinker Bell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头一个走过的是图图。在这支英勇的队伍里，他不能说最不英勇，而是最不走运。他比所有的人冒险的次数都少，因为总是在他一过拐角的时候，大事件才发生。等事情平静了，他就趁机走开，去抢点烧火的柴草。等他回来时，别人已经在打扫血迹了。运道不佳，使得他脸上老是带着愁容；不过，这没使他的性格变酸，反而变甜了，所以他是孩子中最谦逊的一个。可怜的、善良的图图，今晚危险在等着你。要留神哪，否则，冒险的机会就会叫你碰上；你要是承受下来，就会落选一场大灾祸。图图，仙女叮叮铃今天晚上一心要捣乱，正想找一个人作工具，她认为你是孩子们当中最容易受骗的一个。提防着叮叮铃啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this his given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, (a person who gets in pickles-predicaments) and so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly, "Stand forth the one who did this thing," that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in a apologetic sort of way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二个过来的是尼布斯，他欢快而彬彬有礼；后面跟着斯莱持利，他用树枝削成哨子，随着自己吹的曲调，狂欢起舞。斯莱特利是孩子们中最自高自大的一个，他认为他还记得丢失以前的事，记得那些礼节，习俗等等。这使得他的鼻子向上翘着，招人讨厌。第四个是卷毛，他是个小淘气。每次彼得板着面孔说“谁干的谁站出来”时，站出来的常常都是他。所以现在一听到这命令，他就自动站出来，也不管是不是他干的。走在最后的是那对孪生兄弟，我们无法形容他们，因为，只要一形容，准会把他们两个弄错。彼得从不知道什么叫孪生子，他不知道的事，他的队员也不许知道。所以，这两兄弟对他们自己也糊里糊涂，他们只好带着歉意寸步不离地厮守在一起，尽可能让别人感到满意。">查看中文翻译</div>

Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores (Portuguese gold pieces); and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy's brother (but this was ever proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights (Morgan's Skylights); and the Irish bo'sun Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist in Hook's crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt.

<div class="line_en">In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous (dead looking) and blackavized (dark faced), and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a RACONTEUR (storyteller) of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这帮邪恶的匪徒中，最邪恶、最强横的要属詹姆斯·胡克；他自己写做詹·胡克，据说，他是海上库克唯一害怕的人。胡克安安逸逸地躺在一辆粗糙的大车子里，由他手下的人推拉着走。他没有右手，用一只铁钩代替。他不时挥动着那只铁钩，催手下的人赶快拉。这个凶恶的家伙，把他们像狗一样看待和使唤，他们也像狗一样服从他。说到相貌，他有一副铁青的面孔，他的头发弯成长长的发卷，远看像一支支黑蜡烛，使他那英俊的五官带上一种恶狠狠的神情。他的眼睛是蓝的，蓝得像勿忘我的花，透着一种深深的忧郁，除非在他把铁钩向你捅来的时候，这时，他眼睛里现出了两点红光，如同燃起了熊熊的火焰，使他的眼睛显得可怕极了。说到举止，他身上还残留着某种爵爷气派，他那种飞扬跋扈的神态，有时会使你心惊胆战。听说他以前还是个出了名的会讲故事的人。他最彬彬有礼的时候，也就是他最残暴恶毒的时候，这大概就是他出身高贵的最确凿的证据了。就是在他赌咒的时候，文雅的词句也丝毫不亚于他那显赫的仪态，表明他和他的水手们属于不同的阶层。这个人骁勇无比。据说，唯一使他畏怯的，是见到他自己的血。那血很浓，颜色异乎寻常。说到底，他多少有点模仿查理二世。因为，他在早年听说，他长得特像那位倒霉的斯图亚特君主。他嘴里叼着一根他自己设计的烟斗，那烟斗能使他同时吸两支雪茄。不过，他身上最阴森可怖的一部分，当然就是他的那只铁爪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook's method. Skylights will do. As they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在让我们来杀一名海盗，看看胡克是怎样杀人的，就拿“天窗”做个样子吧。在海盗们行进的时候，“天窗”笨手笨脚、鬼鬼祟祟地凑到了胡克跟前，用手去乱摸他那镶着花边的衣领。铁钩伸了出来，只听得一声撕裂的声音，一声惨叫，“天窗”的尸体就给踢到了一边，海盗们照旧前进。胡克连雪茄也没有从嘴里拿出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war- path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful of dusky Dianas (Diana = goddess of the woods) and the belle of the Piccaninnies, coquettish (flirting), cold and amorous (loving) by turns; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尾随在海盗后面，悄无声息地潜行过来的，是印第安人；他们走过的那条小径，缺乏经验的眼睛是很难觉察的；他们一个个把眼睛睁得溜圆。他们手持战斧和刀，赤裸的身躯上涂着的油彩闪闪发光。身上挂着成串的头皮，有孩子们的，也有海盗的。因为这些印第安人属皮卡尼尼族，和那些心肠较软的德拉华族和休伦族印第安人完全不同。在前锋，匍匐蛇行的是魁伟的小豹子，他是一员骁将，他脖子上挂着那么多头皮，爬行时，坠得他几乎都爬不快了。殿后的、处在最危险的位置的，是虎莲——她骄傲地直立着，生来就是一位公主。她是肤色黝黑的女将中最标致的一个，是皮卡尼尼族的大美人；她时而卖弄风骚，时而冷若冰霜，时而热情如火。武士们没有一个不想娶这个尤物为妻的，可是她用她那把斧子挡开了所有的求婚者。瞧他们是怎样穿过落在地上的枝叶，不发出一点声响，唯一能听到的，是他们那粗重的喘息声。原来他们在饱食之后，都有点发胖了；不过，他们渐渐地就会消瘦下去。眼下，胖却是他们的主要危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shall I after him, Captain," asked pathetic Smee, "and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?" Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以去追他吗，船长？”可怜巴巴的斯密问，“我可以用我的约翰开瓶钻给他挠痒痒吗？”斯密喜欢给什么东西都起一个好听的名字，他管他的短弯刀叫约翰开瓶钻，因为他喜欢用刀在伤口里旋转。你可以列举出斯密的许多可爱的特征。例如，杀过人之后，他不去擦拭武器，却总是擦拭眼镜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo'sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="不光是烟哩，孩子们的声音也传了出来。因为他们躲藏在这个窝里，觉得很安全，于是就快快活活地闲谈起来。海盗狞恶地听了一会，然后把蘑菇放回原处。他们四下里环视了一遭，发现了七棵树上的树洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"To return to the ship," Hook replied slowly through his teeth, "and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids' Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don't know how dangerous 'tis to eat rich damp cake." He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. "Aha, they will die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“回到船上去，”胡克慢慢地从牙缝里挤出话来，“做一只厚厚的、油腻腻的、浇上绿糖的大蛋糕。下面一定只有一间屋子，因为只有一个烟囱。这些傻田鼠没头脑，竟不懂得他们不需要每人一个出口，可见他们没有母亲。我们把那只蛋糕放在人鱼的礁湖岸边，这些孩子常在那儿游泳，和人鱼戏耍。他们会看到蛋糕，会狼吞虎咽地把它吃下去。因为他们没有母亲，他们不懂得，吃油腻的、潮湿的蛋糕有多么危险。”他放声大笑，这回不是干笑，是开怀的畅笑。“哈哈，他们要死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
