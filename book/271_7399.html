<div class="line_en">His lips twisted up to the side ruefully. "I would have tried to protect you, too, if I'd known how. But I guess you've never fit into the fainthearted category, have you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他无比悔恨的瘪起嘴说：“如果我知道怎么做的话，我也会尽全部力量保护你的。但我想你从来就不是一个胆小和孩子，对吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I nodded. "I know. I don't want to freak her out. Better to protect her. This stuff isn't for the fainthearted."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然。”我答应他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been a long day in some ways, and so short in others. Charlie was late for dinner -- Sue Clearwater was cooking for him and Billy. That was going to be an awkward evening, but at least he'd be eating real food; I was glad someone was trying to keep him from starving due to his lack of cooking ability.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天似乎很漫长，又似乎不是。早就到查理的晚饭时间了——SueClearwater这几天在帮他和比利煮饭。我知道那样会很尴尬，但至少他能吃上真正的晚餐，看到有人在帮他逃脱因为不会煮饭而饿死的命运，实在是让我很高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All day the tension had made the minutes pass slowly; Charlie had never relaxed the stiff set of his shoulders. But he'd been in no hurry to leave, either. He'd watched two whole games -- thankfully so absorbed in his thoughts that he was totally oblivious to Emmett's suggestive jokes that got more pointed and less football-related with each aside -- and the after-game commentaries, and then the news, not moving until Seth had reminded him of the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧张让今天的每一分钟都显得非常漫长，查理绷紧的肩膀一直没能放松下来。但他还是不想离开，已经看了整整两场比赛了——谢天谢地他沉迷在比赛中，完全忽视了埃美特那越来越讽刺，跟橄榄球越来越不沾边的玩笑，当然也没注意到赛后评论和新闻都已经结束了，直到塞思提醒他时间差不多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had been clear in Charlie's eyes that he hadn't trusted Seth's assessment, but he'd let Seth lead the way out. The doubt was still there as he paused now. The clouds were thinning, the rain gone. The sun might even make an appearance just in time to set.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理的眼神明摆着在告诉我们他不相信塞思的话，不过还是跟着塞思站起来准备离开。但他停下的脚步让我们知道怀疑仍然存在。门外，云已经变淡了，雨也停了，太阳似乎也准备露下脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He chewed on his lip for half a second, then leaned slowly toward me with his arms cautiously extended. I shifted Renesmee -- napping now -- to my left arm, locked my teeth, held my breath, and wrapped my right arm very lightly around his warm, soft waist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他咬着嘴唇想了一会儿，接着朝我慢慢的伸开双手。我把蕾妮斯梅——开始打盹儿了——移到左手抱着，死死的咬住牙，屏住呼吸，右手轻轻的回抱着他温暖、柔软的胸怀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我也爱你，孩子。无论什么改变了，对我来说你还是原来那个女儿。”他伸出一只手指碰了碰蕾妮斯梅的小脸蛋儿：“她看起来非常像你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I kept my expression casual, though I felt anything but. "More like Edward, I think." I hesitated, and then added, "She has your curls."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我努力保持着自然的表情，虽然紧张到什么感觉都没有：“我倒觉得更像爱德华，”犹豫了一下还是加了一句：“但她的那头卷发跟你一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shivered and pulled away. I dropped my arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他颤抖了一下，推开我。我放下手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlie started, then snorted. "Huh. Guess she does. Huh. Grandpa." He shook his head doubtfully. "Do I ever get to hold her?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理刚抬起脚，嗤了嗤鼻说：“哼，那是。哼，外公嘛。”他不可置信的摇摇头说：“我能抱下她吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here," I said, holding her out to him. He automatically made an awkward cradle with his arms, and I tucked Renesmee into it. His skin wasn't quite as hot as hers, but it made my throat tickle to feel the warmth flowing under the thin membrane. Where my white skin brushed him it left goose bumps. I wasn't sure if this was a reaction to my new temperature or totally psychological.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“接着，”我说，把她递给他。他马上笨手笨脚的把手臂环成摇篮状，想让她睡上去，我把蕾妮斯梅塞了进去。虽然他的皮肤没有她热，但还是让我的喉咙痒起来，本能的感觉到那层薄薄的皮肤下血液的温度。他被我雪白的皮肤擦到的地方，似乎鸡皮疙瘩全起了，我不知道这是对我体温的一个自然的条件反射呢，还是只是心理作用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I blinked in shock and then composed myself. After considering for a half second and judging Renesmee's appearance -- she looked completely out -- I decided that I might as well push my luck to the limit, since things were going so well today…</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sturdy is good," Charlie said, seeing my expression. Then he muttered to himself, "She'll need to be tough, surrounded by all this craziness." He bounced his arms gently, swaying a little from side to side. "Prettiest baby I ever saw, including you, kid. Sorry, but it's true."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“健壮很好，”看到我的表情查理补了一句，接着自言自语起来：“她得非常勇敢才行，周围都是些疯狂的家伙，”他慢慢的晃起手臂，轻轻的摇着：“她是我见过最可爱的宝宝，包括你在内，女儿。很抱歉，但是事实。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Huh?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“也谢谢你，老爸。变化来得太快了，让我的脑袋一刻都停不下来。如果没有你，我都不知道怎样才能让自己有一点——一点真实感。”我差点就把自己变成了什么说出来，那对他来说远远超过界限了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="查理的肚子轰隆隆的响起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go eat, Dad. We will be here." I remembered how it felt, that first uncomfortable immersion in fantasy -- the sensation that everything would disappear in the light of the rising sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlie nodded and then reluctantly returned Renesmee to me. He glanced past me into the house; his eyes were a little wild for a minute as he stared around the big bright room. Everyone was still there, besides Jacob, who I could hear raiding the refrigerator in the kitchen; Alice was lounging on the bottom step of the staircase with Jasper's head in her lap; Carlisle had his head bent over a fat book in his lap; Esme was humming to herself, sketching on a notepad, while Rosalie and Emmett laid out the foundation for a monumental house of cards under the stairs; Edward had drifted to his piano and was playing very softly to himself. There was no evidence that the day was coming to a close, that it might be time to eat or shift activities in preparation for evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理点点头，很不情愿的吧蕾妮斯梅还给我。他的目光越过我扫了一下房子，对这间高大的明亮的屋子似乎有些惊讶。所有人都还在那里，除了雅各布在偷袭厨房的冰箱；爱丽丝懒洋洋的躺在楼梯口，贾斯帕枕着她的膝盖；卡莱尔完全沉迷在自己膝盖上的那本大书中，埃斯梅自娱自乐的边哼着歌，边在素描本上画着什么；罗莎莉和埃美特在楼梯下计算一个经典的别墅要花多少钱；爱德华早就坐在钢琴前给自己演奏着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I followed him out the back, toward the garage; I could hear all the others trailing behind. There was a largish granite boulder standing up out of a tumble of rocks near the river, obviously Emmett's goal. Though the big rock was a little rounded and irregular, it would do the job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跟着他走出后花园，向着车库那边走去；听见其他人都跟在我们后面。河边碎石滩上睡着一块巨大的花岗岩石台，很明显那就是目的地。虽然巨石表面有点弯曲不太平坦，但绝对足够胜任这次工作了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was nervous again as I watched the thick muscles in Emmett's arm roll, but I kept my face smooth. Edward had promised I would be stronger than anyone for a while. He seemed very confident about this, and I felt strong. That strong? I wondered, looking at Emmett's biceps. I wasn't even two days old, though, and that ought to count for something. Unless nothing was normal about me. Maybe I wasn't as strong as a normal newborn. Maybe that's why control was so easy for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到他手臂上那结实的肌肉我有点紧张，但面上还是不露分毫。爱德华向我保证过这段时间没人能比我更强壮，他看上去对此非常确定，让我也不由得自信起来。但自己有那么强壮吗？我嘀咕着，瞟了一眼埃美特的二头肌。我转变完成还没有两天啊，虽然这应该是好事。除非我跟一般的吸血鬼完全不一样，可能我不像一般的新生儿那么强壮，可能这才是我之所以自控力那么好的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, I could feel the force he was exerting. My new mind seemed pretty good at all kinds of calculations, and so I could tell that if he wasn't meeting any resistance, his hand would have pounded right through the rock without difficulty. The pressure increased, and I wondered randomly if a cement truck doing forty miles an hour down a sharp decline would have similar power. Fifty miles an hour? Sixty? Probably more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢，我能感觉到他在用力，但无论从哪方面看我还是感觉良好，因为我知道如果他不是遇到了抵抗的话，他早就一下子把我的手狠狠的撞向石台了。压力在增大，但我的脑子却在胡思乱想着，可能一辆水泥搅拌卡车以40公里的速度冲下陡坡才可能产生同样的冲击力。50公里？60？可能更高也说不定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't enough to move me. His hand shoved against mine with crushing force, but it wasn't unpleasant. It felt kind of good in a weird way. I'd been so very careful since the last time I woke up, trying so hard not to break things. It was a strange relief to use my muscles. To let the strength flow rather than struggling to restrain it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但还是不足以推动我。他用压倒般的力量推着我的手，却好像不是太糟糕。从某种诡异的角度说感觉还蛮好的。自从这次我清醒以来，我一直都是那么的小心翼翼，不去破坏任何东西。但当我真正使用着自己的力量时，我才发现自己居然放松下来——把剩余的力量排走，而不是死命的压抑它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emmett grunted; his forehead creased and his whole body strained in one rigid line toward the obstacle of my unmoving hand. I let him sweat -- figuratively -- for a moment while I enjoyed the sensation of the crazy force running through my arm.</div>
