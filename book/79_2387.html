<div class="line_en">Stripped to his underpants, lying on the examination table, Danny Torrance looked very small. He was looking up at Dr. ("Just call me Bill") Edmonds, who was wheeling a large black machine up beside him. Danny rolled his eyes to get a better look at it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny thought about it. He looked at Edmonds and then, with a small effort of concentration, he tried to catch Edmonds's thoughts or at least the color of his mood. And suddenly he got an oddly comforting image in his head: file cabinets, their doors sliding shut one after another, locking with a click. Written on the small tabs in the center of each door was: A-C, SECRET; D-G, SECRET; and so on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼惦量着他的话。他看着埃德蒙兹，这时，他稍稍集中注意力，想抓住埃德蒙兹的心思，或至少捕捉到他的情绪。突然，丹尼脑子里出现了一幅奇怪但令人心安的景象：一排档案柜，它们的门一个接一个关上了，咔嗒一声锁上了。这些门正中的小标签上写着：A——C，秘密；D——G，秘密…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么样的东西？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"From what Danny told me, his `invisible friend' was truly a friend until you folks moved out here from New England. Tony has only become a threatening figure since that move. The pleasant interludes have become nightmarish, even more frightening to your son because he can't remember exactly what the nightmares are about. That's common enough. We all remember our pleasant dreams more clearly than the scary ones. There seems to be a buffer somewhere between the conscious and the subconscious, and one hell of a bluenose lives in there. This censor only lets through a small amount, and often what does come through is only symbolic. That's oversimplified Freud, but it does pretty much describe what we know of the mind's interaction with itself."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, Wendy," Jack said. "I meant to do it. I guess someplace inside I really did mean to do that to him. Or something even worse." He looked back at Edmonds again. "You know something, Doctor? This is the first time the word divorce has been mentioned between us. And alcoholism. And child-beating. Three firsts in five minutes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，温迪，”杰克说。“我是故意的。我想，在内心深处，我真的是故意那样对他，甚至比这更糟糕。”他又抬头看着埃德蒙兹。“你知道吗，大夫？这是我们第一次提到‘离婚’这个字眼儿，还有酗酒，打孩子。五分钟内三个第一次。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That may be at the root of the problem," Edmonds said. "I am not a psychiatrist. If you want Danny to see a child psychiatrist, I can recommend a good one who works out of the Mission Ridge Medical Center in Boulder. But I am fairly confident of my diagnosis. Danny is an intelligent, imaginative, perceptive boy. I don't believe he would have been as upset by your marital problems as you believed. Small children are great accepters. They don't understand shame, or the need to hide things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可能就是问题的根源，”埃德蒙兹说。“我不是精神病医生。如果你们想让丹尼看看儿童精神病医生，我倒可以推荐一位不错的，他在博尔德米兴岭医疗中心工作。不过，我对我的诊断相当有把握。丹尼是个聪明、想像力丰富、有悟性的孩子。我相信，你们的婚姻问题为他带来的忧虑并不会像你们认为的那样大。小孩子都惯于接受，他们不懂什么是耻辱，也不知遮遮掩掩为何物。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I see," Edmonds said neutrally. "I knew the arm had been broken, of course. It was set well." He pushed back from his desk a little and crossed his legs. "If I may be frank, it's obvious that he's been in no way abused since then. Other than the stings, there's nothing on him but the normal bruises and scabs that any kid has in abundance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“明白了，”埃德蒙兹说，并不感到惊奇。“我当然知道那只胳膊骨折过，不过愈合得很好。”他往后坐了坐，翘起了二郎腿。“坦率地说，显然自那以后他就没有受到过任何伤害。除了蜇伤和每个小孩都有的磕磕碰碰外，他身上什么伤疤都没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But he sensed the things that were wrong. Chief among them from his point of view was not the broken arm but the broken or breaking link between you two. He mentioned divorce to me, but not the broken arm. When my nurse mentioned the set to him, he simply shrugged it off. It was no pressure thing. `It happened a long time ago' is what I think he said."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have him, all the same," Edmonds said dryly. "At any rate, he retires into a fantasy world from time to time. Nothing unusual about that; lots of kids do. As I recall, I had my own invisible friend when I was Danny's age, a talking rooster named Chug-Chug. Of course no one could see Chug-Chug but me. I had two older brothers who often left me behind, and in such a situation Chug-Chug came in mighty handy. And of course you two must understand why Danny's invisible friend is named Tony instead of Mike or Hal or Dutch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可他偏偏就是你们的孩子，”埃德蒙兹说。“他时不时地陷入幻想世界中，不管怎么说，这都是令人担忧的事。不过，这并不稀罕，许多孩子都这样。我记得，在丹尼这个年纪的时候，我也有自己的‘看不见的朋友’，那是一只会说话的公鸡，名叫曲曲。当然，除了我谁都看不见曲曲。我有两个哥哥，他们经常撂下我不管，这种时候，曲曲就陪我玩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“该死的，我猜也就是这么回事，”杰克说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmonds smiled a little. "And Danny himself told me that Tony often showed him things that never occurred. Visions based on faulty perception, that's all. Danny is doing subconsciously what these so-called mystics and mind readers do quite consciously and cynically. I admire him for it. If life doesn't cause him to retract his antennae, I think he'll be quite a man." Wendy nodded -- of course she thought Danny would be quite a man -- but the doctor's explanation struck her as glib. It tasted more like margarine than butter. Edmonds had not lived with them. He had not been there when Danny found lost buttons, told her that maybe the TV Guide was under the bed, that he thought he better wear his rubbers to nursery school even though the sun was out… and later that day they had walked home under her umbrella through the pouring rain. Edmonds couldn't know of the curious way Danny had of preguessing them both. She would decide to have an unusual evening cup of tea, go out in the kitchen and find her cup out with a tea bag in it. She would remember that the books were due at the library and find them all neatly piled up on the hall table, her library card on top. Or Jack would take it into his head to wax the Volkswagen and find Danny already out there, listening to tinny top-forty music on his crystal radio as he sat on the curb to watch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德蒙兹微微一笑。“丹尼自己还告诉我，托尼常给他看从未发生过的事情，这不过是错误的感觉带来的幻觉而已。丹尼下意识地做着这些所谓的神秘事情，而通灵者则常常是有意识的和玩世不恭的。我很羡慕他，如果今后的日子他仍然能够保持这种敏锐的直觉，我想他会成大器的。”温迪点了点头——她当然认为丹尼会成大器——但医生的解释却流于肤浅，听上去像人造黄油而不像天然黄油。埃德蒙兹没有和他们一起生活过。丹尼找回丢失的纽扣的时候，告诉她《电视报》也许在床下的时候，认为他自己最好穿雨靴上幼儿园的时候（尽管太阳已经升起，而且后来她果真会在倾盆大雨中打着伞把他接回家），医生都不在场。他俩想做什么，丹尼常常能未卜先知，医生对此也无从知晓。要是她决定打破常规喝杯夜茶，她就会在厨房里发现，杯子摆好了，里面放着一袋茶。要是她记起图书馆的书到期该还了，她就会发现，这些书已经整整齐齐地摞在客厅的桌子上，借书证放在最上面。或者，要是杰克想出去给汽车打打蜡，便会发现丹尼早已坐在马路边，听着收音机播放的流行音乐，等着看他干活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I believe it's because Tony has outlived his usefulness," Edmonds said. "He was born -- Tony, not Danny -- at a time when you and your husband were straining to keep your marriage together. Your husband was drinking too much. There was the incident of the broken arm. The ominous quiet between you." Ominous quiet, yes, that phrase was the real thing, anyway. The stiff, tense meals where the only conversation had been please pass the butter or Danny, eat the rest of your carrots or may I be excused, please. The nights when Jack was gone and she had lain down, dry-eyed, on the couch while Danny watched TV. The mornings when she and Jack had stalked around each other like two angry cats with a quivering, frightened mouse between them. It all rang true; (dear God, do old scars ever stop hurting?) horribly, horribly true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为，这是因为托尼已经失去了作用，”埃德蒙兹说。“他出生在——托尼，不是丹尼——你和你丈夫苦苦维持婚姻关系的那段时间。你丈夫喝酒太多，又出了扭断胳膊这件事，还有你俩之间不祥的平静。”不祥的平静，是的，此话不假。每顿饭都吃得那么拘谨、那么紧张，除了递递黄油、丹尼别剩下胡萝卜之类的话外，谁都不吭声。晚上，杰克出去了，丹尼看电视，她就眼巴巴地卧在沙发上。早上，她和杰克各行其事，互不搭理，丹尼就像一只瑟瑟发抖的老鼠，夹在两只怒气冲冲的猫之间。这一切都是真的，（上帝，旧伤疤会有痊愈的时候吗？）真实得可怕、可怖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmonds resumed, "But things have changed. You know, schizoid behavior is a pretty common thing in children. It's accepted, because all we adults have this unspoken agreement that children are lunatics. They have invisible friends. They may go and sit in the closet when they're depressed, withdrawing from the world. They attach talismanic importance to a special blanket, or a teddy bear, or a stuffed tiger. They suck their thumbs. When an adult sees things that aren't there, we consider him ready for the rubber room. When a child says he's seen a troll in his bedroom or a vampire outside the window, we simply smile indulgently. We have a one-sentence explanation that explains the whole range of such phenomena in children --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德蒙兹接着说：“但现在的情况已经改变了。你们知道，精神分裂行为在儿童当中相当普遍。大家都认可这样的行为，因为我们成年人都有一种心照不宣的看法，即儿童都是疯疯癫癫的。他们有‘看不见的朋友’；心情抑郁的时候，他们会独处一室，避开外界；他们会把一条特殊的毛毯、一只玩具熊或玩具老虎看作护身符一样重要的东西；他们吮拇指。如果哪个成年人看见了子虚乌有的东西，我们会认为他该进疯人院了。可是，如果一个小孩说自己看见了卧室里的巨人或窗外的吸血鬼，我们便只是一笑了之。发生在儿童身上的这些现象可以用一句话来解释——”">查看中文翻译</div>

Instead of `growing out of' is childhood schizophrenia, he might well have grown into it."</div>

To my mind, he is in the perfect healing situation.

He says that you two are no longer considering divorce. Is he as right as I think he is?"</div>
