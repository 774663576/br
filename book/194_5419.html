<div class="line_en">Anyone who had seen the lurid Bosch painting of the same name understood the jab; the painting, like the forest, was dark and twisted, a purgatory for freaks and fetishists.

Ahead, two topless teenage girls shot smoldering gazes into the taxi. Beyond them, a well-oiled black man in a G-string turned and flexed his buttocks.

<div class="line_en">Langdon nodded, unable to imagine a less congruous a backdrop for the legend he was about to tell. He wondered where to begin. The brotherhood's history spanned more than a millennium… an astonishing chronicle of secrets, blackmail, betrayal, and even brutal torture at the hands of an angry Pope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登点点头，心想：这样的背景真是再合适不过了。他一时不知从何说起。隐修会有长达一个多世纪的历史……那里面有秘密、有敲诈、有背叛，甚至还有教皇一怒之下实施的酷刑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"King Godefroi was allegedly the possessor of a powerful secret -- a secret that had been in his family since the time of Christ. Fearing his secret might be lost when he died, he founded a secret brotherhood -- the Priory of Sion -- and charged them with protecting his secret by quietly passing it on from generation to generation. During their years in Jerusalem, the Priory learned of a stash of hidden documents buried beneath the ruins of Herod's temple, which had been built atop the earlier ruins of Solomon's Temple. These documents, they believed, corroborated Godefroi's powerful secret and were so explosive in nature that the Church would stop at nothing to get them." Sophie looked uncertain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"据说，戈弗提国王继承了一个具有极大威力的秘密——从基督时代起这个秘密就在他的家族中世代流传。国王怕他死后秘密失传，就指定了一个秘密的教会组织——郇山隐修会——来保守这个秘密。在耶路撒冷的时候，隐修会得知希律神庙的废墟下埋藏着一些文件，而希律神庙则是在索罗门神庙的废墟上建立起来的。据他们所知，这些文件可以用来确认戈弗提国王的那个威力极大的秘密，正因如此，天主教会将不遗余力地要把它弄到手。"索菲将信将疑。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For academics, the Templars' history was a precarious world where fact, lore, and misinformation had become so intertwined that extracting a pristine truth was almost impossible. Nowadays, Langdon hesitated even to mention the Knights Templar while lecturing because it invariably led to a barrage of convoluted inquiries into assorted conspiracy theories.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Priory vowed that no matter how long it took, these documents must be recovered from the rubble beneath the temple and protected forever, so the truth would never die. In order to retrieve the documents from within the ruins, the Priory created a military arm -- a group of nine knights called the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon." Langdon paused. "More commonly known as the Knights Templar."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"隐修会发誓无论过多久也要将这些文件挖掘出来，让它们永远流传下去。为了保护废墟中的文件，他们成立了一支武装队伍——由九名骑士组成的‘基督和所罗门神庙的骑士团’。"兰登停了停，接着说。"就是众所周知的‘圣殿武士团’。"'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon grinned. "Nobody knows for sure, but the one thing on which all academics agree is this: The Knights discovered something down there in the ruins… something that made them wealthy and powerful beyond anyone's wildest imagination." Langdon quickly gave Sophie the standard academic sketch of the accepted Knights Templar history, explaining how the Knights were in the Holy Land during the Second Crusade and told King Baldwin II that they were there to protect Christian pilgrims on the roadways. Although unpaid and sworn to poverty, the Knights told the king they required basic shelter and requested his permission to take up residence in the stables under the ruins of the temple. King Baldwin granted the soldiers' request, and the Knights took up their meager residence inside the devastated shrine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='兰登冷笑道："没有人知道，但学者们一致认为：武士团在废墟下发现了些什么……这一发现使他们变得极为富有，极为有权势。"兰登开始快速地用标准的学术观点向索菲介绍"圣殿武士团"的历史。他解释道，武士团参与了第二次圣战，他们告诉国王鲍德温二世说他们是为了保护赶路的朝圣者。他们分文不取，但却向国王提出基本的驻扎要求，请求国王允许他们住在神庙废墟的马厩中。鲍德温国王答应了他们的要求，于是武士团就住进了荒废的神殿中。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The odd choice of lodging, Langdon explained, had been anything but random. The Knights believed the documents the Priory sought were buried deep under the ruins -- beneath the Holy of Holies, a sacred chamber where God Himself was believed to reside. Literally, the very center of the Jewish faith. For almost a decade, the nine Knights lived in the ruins, excavating in total secrecy through solid rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登解释道，武士团选择这样奇怪的驻扎地绝非偶然。武士团相信隐修会所追寻的文件就深深地埋藏在废墟下面——在圣地下面一个神圣的密室内，这个密室既是上帝所在的地方，也是犹太教的中心圣地。九名骑士在废墟中住了将近十年，秘密地在坚硬的石块中发掘文件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They certainly did," Langdon said, explaining how it had taken nine years, but the Knights had finally found what they had been searching for. They took the treasure from the temple and traveled to Europe, where their influence seemed to solidify overnight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"他们确实有所发现。"兰登说完又继续解释道，骑士们花了九年时间终于找到了他们所要搜寻的东西。他们带着发现的珍宝去了欧洲，在那里他们一夜之间就声名远扬。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nobody was certain whether the Knights had blackmailed the Vatican or whether the Church simply tried to buy the Knights' silence, but Pope Innocent II immediately issued an unprecedented papal bull that afforded the Knights Templar limitless power and declared them "a law unto themselves" -- an autonomous army independent of all interference from kings and prelates, and political.</div>

<div class="line_en">With their new carte blanche from the Vatican, the Knights Templar expanded at a staggering rate, both in numbers and political force, amassing vast estates in over a dozen countries. They began extending credit to bankrupt royals and charging interest in return, thereby establishing modern banking and broadening their wealth and influence still further.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the 1300s, the Vatican sanction had helped the Knights amass so much power that Pope Clement V decided that something had to be done. Working in concert with France's King Philippe IV, the Pope devised an ingeniously planned sting operation to quash the Templars and seize their treasure, thus taking control of the secrets held over the Vatican. In a military maneuver worthy of the CIA, Pope Clement issued secret sealed orders to be opened simultaneously by his soldiers all across Europe on Friday, October 13 of 1307.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They do, under a variety of names. Despite Clement's false charges and best efforts to eradicate them, the Knights had powerful allies, and some managed to escape the Vatican purges. The Templars' potent treasure trove of documents, which had apparently been their source of power, was Clement's true objective, but it slipped through his fingers. The documents had long since been entrusted to the Templars' shadowy architects, the Priory of Sion, whose veil of secrecy had kept them safely out of range of the Vatican's onslaught. As the Vatican closed in, the Priory smuggled their documents from a Paris preceptory by night onto Templar ships in La Rochelle."</div>
