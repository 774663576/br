<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，的确如此。”卢平说，“他们花了将近三年的时间才做到这一点。你爸爸和在这里的小天狼星是全校最聪明的学生。他们是幸运的，因为阿尼马吉变形术有可能走火入魔出大错——所以魔法部才密切注视那些想这样做的人。彼得需要小天狼星和詹姆的大力协助。最后，在我们五年级的时侯，他们学会了变形。他们每人都可以随意变成不同的动物。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. "All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me… and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it… so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卢平的脸板起来了，声音里带着自我嫌恶。“这一年里，我一直在和自己斗争，拿不定主意要不要告诉邓布利多：小天狼星是阿尼马格斯。但是我没有说。为什么呢？因为我太怯懦。告诉他，就意味着我在学生时代曾经辜负他的信任，意味着承认我还曾带领他人和我在一起…而对于我来说，邓布利多的信任极其重要。我还是孩子的时候，他接受我入学，我成年以后到处碰壁，因为我是狼人而找不到有报酬的工作，他却给了我工作。这样，我就说服了自己，认为小天狼星是利用他从伏地魔那里学来的邪法混进学校的，他成为阿尼马格斯和这毫无关系…所以，在某种意义上，斯内普对我的看法一直是对的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Severus was very interested in where I went every month." Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "We were in the same year, you know, and we -- er -- didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field… anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life… Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel.
