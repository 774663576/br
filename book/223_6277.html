<div class="line_en">When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights in paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never to be seen. I could gather from her that he continued in weak health, and was a tiresome inmate. She said Mr Heathcliff seemed to dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together. There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and aches, and pains of some sort.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had sad work with little Cathy that day; she rose in high glee, eager to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed the news of his departure, that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her, by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, `if I can get him'; and there were no hopes of that. This promise poorly pacified her: but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of her father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognize him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天我们对小凯蒂可煞费苦心。她兴高采烈地起床，热望着陪她的表弟，一听到他已离去的消息，紧跟着又是眼泪又是叹气，使埃德加先生不得不亲自去安慰她，肯定他不久一定会回来；可是，他又加上一句，“如果我能把他弄回来的话。”而那是全无希望的。这个诺言很难使她平静下来；但是时间却更有力；虽然有时候她还问她父亲说林惇什么时候回来，但在她真的再看见他之前，他的容貌已在她的记忆里变得很模糊，以致见面时也不认识了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`And I never knew such a faint-hearted creature,' added the woman; nor one so careful of hisseln. He will go on, if I leave the window open a bit late in the evening. Oh! it's killing! a breath of night air! And he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca pipe is poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk, milk for ever -- heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter; and there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the fire, some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him -- Hareton is not bad-natured, though he's rough -- they're sure to part, one swearing and the other crying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a mummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then, he won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him upstairs directly.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从来没有见过这么一个没精神的人，”那女人又说，“也没有见过一个这么保养自己的人。要是我在晚上把窗子稍微关迟了一点，他就一定要闹个没完。啊！吸一口夜晚的空气，就简直是要害了他！他在仲夏时分也一定要生个火；约瑟夫的烟斗也是毒药；而且他一定总要有糖果细点，总要有牛奶，永远是牛奶——也从来不管别人在冬天多受苦；而他就坐在那儿，裹着他的皮大氅坐在火炉边他的椅子上。炉台上摆着些面包、水，或别的能一点点吸着吃的饮料；如果哈里顿出于怜悯来陪他玩——哈里顿天性并不坏，虽然他是粗野的——结果准是这一个骂骂咧咧的，那一个嚎啕大哭而散伙。我相信如果他不是主人的儿子的话，主人将会看着恩萧把他打扁还会高兴；而且我相信如果主人知道他在怎样看护自己，哪怕只知道一半，也会把他赶出门的。可是主人不会有干这种事的可能：他从来不到客厅，而且林惇在这房子内任何地方一碰见他，主人就马上叫他上楼去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally; and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这一段叙述，我推想小希刺克厉夫已经完全没人同情，变得自私而讨人嫌了，如果他不是本来如此的话；我对他的兴趣自然而然地也减退了，不过我为他的命运仍然感到悲哀，而且还存个愿望，他要是留下来跟我们住就好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village? She said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father, and both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days afterwards. The housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor: she lives there still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德加先生鼓励我打听消息，我猜想他很想念他，并且愿意冒着风险去看看他。有一次还叫我问问管家林惇到不到村里来？她说他来过两次，骑着马，陪着他的父亲；而这两次之后总有三四天他都装作相当疲倦的样子。如果我记得不错的话，那个管家在他来到两年之后就离去了；我不认识的另一个接替了她；她如今还在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way, till Miss Cathy reached sixteen. On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late mistress's death. Her father invariably spent that day alone in the library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight. Therefore Catherine was thrown on her own resources for amusement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和从前一样，大家愉快地在田庄里度着光阴，直到凯蒂小姐长到十六岁。她生日的那天，我们从来不露出任何欢乐的表示，因为这天也是我那已故的女主人的逝世纪念日。她的父亲在那天总是自己一个人整天待在图书室里；而且在黄昏时还要溜达到吉默吞教堂墓地那边去，逗留在那里常常到半夜以后。所以凯瑟琳总是想法自己玩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This both of March was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young lady came down dressed for going out, and said she had asked to have a ramble on the edge of the moors with me; and Mr Linton had given her leave, if we went only a short distance and were back within the hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二月二十日是一个美丽的春日，当她父亲休息时，我的小姐走下楼来，穿戴好打算出去，而且说她要和我在旷野边上走走。林惇先生已经答应她了，只要我们不走得太远，而且在一个钟头内回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter. She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and watching her, my pet, and my delight, with her golden ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days. It's a pity she could not be content.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我戴上帽子出发，不再想这事了。她在我前面跳着，又回到我身旁，然后又跑掉了，活像个小猎狗；起初我觉得挺有意思，听着远远近近百灵鸟歌唱着，享受着那甜蜜的、温暖的阳光，瞧着她，我的宝贝，我的欢乐，她那金黄色的卷发披散在后面，放光的脸儿像朵盛开的野玫瑰那样温柔和纯洁，眼睛散发着无忧无虑的快乐的光辉。真是个幸福的小东西，在那些日子里，她也是个天使。可惜她是不会知足的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our steps. I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was compelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I felt convinced was Mr Heathcliff himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是有这么多小山和斜坡要爬、要过，终于我开始感到累了，就告诉她我们必须打住往回走。我对她大声喊着，因为她已经走在我前面很远了。也许她没听见，也许就是不理，因为她还是往前走，我无奈只得跟随着她。最后，她钻进了一个山谷；在我再看见她以前，她已经离呼啸山庄比离她自己的家还要近二英里路哩；我瞅见两个人把她抓住了，我深信有一个就是希刺克厉夫先生本人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Heathcliff bid me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to open the door. My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not exactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he met her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury. Linton stood on the hearth. He had been out walking in the fields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry shoes. He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of sixteen. His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion brighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre borrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in the appearance of each. Catherine had reached her full height; her figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits. Linton's looks and movements were very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing. After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to Mr Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这年轻人走向前来，承认他就是。她狂热地吻他，他们彼此凝视着，看到时光在彼此的外表上所造成的变化而惊奇。凯瑟琳已经长得够高了；她的身材又丰满又苗条，像钢丝一样地有弹性，整个容貌由于健康而精神焕发。林惇的神气和动作都很不活泼，他的外形也非常瘦弱；但是他的风度带着一种文雅，缓和了这些缺点，使他还不讨人厌。在和他互相交换多种形式的喜爱的表示之后，他的表姐走到希刺克厉夫先生跟前，他正留在门口，一面注意屋里的人，一面注意外面的事；这就是说，假装看外面，实际上只是注意屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`I've a pleasure in him,' he continued, reflecting aloud. `He has satisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it half so much. But he's no fool; and I can sympathize with all his feelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer, though. And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and ignorance. I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I've taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don't you think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as proud as I am of mine. But there's this difference; one is gold put to the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service of silver. Mine has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. His had first-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing. I have nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware of. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You'll own that I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from his grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对他有兴趣，”他接着说，大声地说出他的想法。“他满足了我的心愿。如果他天生是个呆子，我就连一半乐趣也享受不到。可是他不是呆子；我能够同情他所有的感受，因为我自己也感受过。比如说，我准确地知道他现在感受到什么痛苦；虽然那不过是他所要受的痛苦的开始。他永远也不能从他那粗野无知中解脱出来。我把他抓得比他那无赖父亲管我还紧些，而且贬得更低些；因为他以他的野蛮而自负。我教他嘲笑一切兽性以外的东西，认为这些是愚蠢和软弱的。你不认为辛德雷要是能看见他的儿子的话，会感到骄傲吗？差不多会像我为我自己的儿子感到骄傲一样。可是有这个区别；一个是金子却当铺地的石头用了，另一个是锡擦亮了来仿制银器。我的儿子没有什么价值。可是我有本事使这类的草包尽量振作起来。他的儿子有头等的天赋，却荒废了，变得比没用还糟。我没有什么可惋惜的；他可会有很多，但是，除了我，谁也不曾留意到。最妙的是，哈里顿非常喜欢我，你可以承认在这一点上我胜过了辛德雷。如果这个死去的流氓能从坟墓里站起来谴责我对他的子嗣的虐待，我倒会开心地看到这个所说的子嗣把他打回去，为了他竟敢辱骂他在这世界上唯一的朋友而大为愤慨哩！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to Isabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property. He could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke little of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs Linton's death. `She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was his constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a murderer. Miss Cathy -- conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, rising from hot temper and thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed -- was amazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of remorse. She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view of human nature -- excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till now -- that Mr Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. He merely added:</div>

<div class="line_en">`But Mr Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed Catherine, not at all convinced; `and he didn't object to our seeing each other: he said I might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt Isabella.

I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours. The letter was finished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from the village: but that I didn't learn till some time afterwards. Weeks passed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond of stealing off to corners by herself; and often, if I came near her suddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out beyond the leaves. She also got a trick of coming down early in the morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the arrival of something: and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took special care to remove when she left it.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings, and trinkets which recently formed its contents, were transmuted into bits of folded paper. My curiosity and suspicions were aroused; I determined to take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and my master were safe upstairs, I searched and readily found among my house keys one that would fit the lock. Having opened, I emptied the whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure in my own chamber. Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised to discover that they were a mass of correspondence -- daily almost, it must have been -- from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by her. The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however, they expanded into copious love letters, foolish, as the age of the writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought were borrowed from a more experienced source. Some of them struck me as singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy way that a schoolboy might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart. Whether they satisfied Cathy, I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me. After turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into his jacket pocket, and plucked something out. I went round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's affectionate composition. It was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin's; very pretty and very silly. I shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet, she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single `Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr Linton looked up.</div>
