<div class="line_en">Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him civilly, and invite him in?

<div class="line_en">"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know why I should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor on his way out," said Jo to herself, after two or three encounters, for though there were two paths to Meg's whichever one she took she was sure to meet him, either going or returning. He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. Then, if she was going to Meg's he always had something for the babies. If her face was turned homeward, he had merely strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless they were tired of his frequent calls.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was going on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind to the changes in Jo's face. They never asked why she sang about her work, did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming with her evening exercise. And no one seemed to have the slightest suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with the father, was giving the daughter lessons in love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了第二个星期，每个人都完全知道了正在发生什么事情。可是，大家都试图做出对乔脸色的变化全然不察的样子。他们从不问她为什么一边做活一边唱歌，一天要梳三遍头，为什么傍晚散步脸红起来。巴尔教授一边和爸爸谈哲学，一边给女儿上爱情课。似乎没有谁对此有丝毫的怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but sternly tried to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led a somewhat agitated life. She was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of independence. Laurie was her especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called Mr. Bhaer 'a capital old fellow' in public, never alluded, in the remotest manner, to Jo's improved appearance, or expressed the least surprise at seeing the Professor's hat on the Marches' table nearly every evening. But he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔现在已是六神无主，不能保持昔日庄重的常态了。她试图对自己的感情采取断然措施，可她做不到，而愈加心浮气躁。过去她多次强烈宣布要独立，而现在，她非常害怕因为自食其言而让人笑话。她特别怕劳里会笑话她，幸好有人管着他，他的言行举止倒没有什么出格、值得非议之处。公开场合他从不称巴尔先生为“极好的老头儿”，也不以任何方式暗示乔大有变化。看到教授的帽子几乎是每天晚上都出现在马奇家客厅的桌子上，他也没有一点儿大惊小怪的表示。他心中欣喜不已，企盼那个时候来临，他好送给乔一只馈赠盘，上面画有一个莽汉和一根破权杖，就像是枚盾形纹章，再合适不过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother, and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite of her heartache, "How good she is to me! What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话乔听见了，但却没作回答。她只是亲了妈妈一下，便迅速走开了。她尽管伤心，还是带着感激的喜悦想道：“她对我多好啊！那些没有妈妈帮助度过难关的姑娘们可怎么办啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses, banks, and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate, but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in another, with most unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels, being half-smothered by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously by busy men who looked as if they wondered 'how the deuce she got there'. A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons. For the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet. Now she remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten to take in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing, and nothing could be done but borrow one or submit to a drenching. She looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already flecked with black, forward along the muddy street, then one long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with 'Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co.' over the door, and said to herself, with a sternly reproachful air…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="先生们往往聚集在事务室、银行和批发商品贮藏室。卖绸缎呢绒的商店不和上述地方位于一处，乔却发现自己不觉走到了那些地方。她一件差事没干，沿路闲逛，好像在等着什么人。她带着非常不适合女性的兴趣浏览着这个橱窗里的机器仪表，那个橱窗里的羊毛样品。她打翻了货桶，几乎被下卸的货包压倒，忙碌着的男人们没礼貌地乱推着她，他们的神情好像奇怪“她究竟怎么到了这里？”她脸上感到了一滴雨点，这把她的思绪从受挫的希望拉回到毁了的丝带。雨点继续在落，她作为女人又作为情人的细心柔肠让她感觉到了雨点。虽然挽救破碎的心为时已晚，但也许还能挽救她的帽子。现在她记起了那把小雨桑仓促上路时她忘了带上它。可是后悔无益。没什么好做的，要么去借一把伞，要么任由雨淋。她抬头看了看阴霾的天气，低头看看已经弄上点点黑斑的的红色帽结，又朝前看看泥泞的街道，然后踌躇地回头久久看着一家肮脏的货栈，货栈门上写着“霍夫曼斯瓦兹联营公司”。乔带着苛刻的自责神情自言自语道——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said, "I beg pardon, ma'am," and looked mortally offended. Somewhat daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over the devoted ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on, with increasing dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of umbrellas overhead. The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样想着，她猛地冲往街对面，差一点被一辆开过来的卡车轧死。她一下撞进一个威严的老先生怀里，老先生有些生气，他说道：“对不起，小姐。”乔有点胆怯了，她站直身，将手帕盖住那注定要遭殃的丝带，把诱惑置于脑后，慌不择路地走着。她脚踝越来越湿，头顶上行人的雨伞撞来撞去。一把有些旧的蓝伞在她没有保护的帽子上定住不动了，一下子吸引了她的注意力。她抬起头来，看到巴尔先生正朝下看着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends.

<div class="line_en">"Yes, it's late, and I'm so tired." Jo's voice was more pathetic than she knew. For now the sun seemed to have gone in as suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy and miserable again, and for the first time she discovered that her feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder than the former, fuller of pain than the latter. Mr. Bhaer was going away, he only cared for her as a friend, it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. With this idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if he had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his knees, on account of the mud. Neither could he offer Jo his hand, except figuratively, for both were full. Much less could he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street, though he was near it. So the only way in which he could express his rapture was to look at her, with an expression which glorified his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard. If he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the most beautiful woman living, and she found him more "Jove-like" than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed mending.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种求婚方式当然困难，因为，即便巴尔先生愿意下跪，地上的烂泥也使他不能这么做。用比喻的说法，他也不能伸手给乔向她求婚，因为他双手都拿着东西。更不用说在光天化日之下忘情地表达爱慕之心，尽管他差一点就这样做了。所以，唯一能表达他狂喜心情的方式便是看着她，那是种容光焕发的表情。实际上，他胡子上闪着的亮晶晶的泪光里似乎有着小彩虹。假若他不是那样深爱着乔，我想，当时他不可能那样的。她看着决非翩翩淑女，她的裙子处于悲惨的境地，胶靴上泥巴一直溅到脚脖子，帽子也一塌糊涂。幸好，在巴尔先生眼中，她是世上活着的女人中最美丽的。而她也发现他比以前更“像朱庇特”了，虽然他的帽边差不多卷曲了，小溪从那上面流向他的双肩（因为他把伞全给乔遮雨了），而且他手套的每一个指头都需要缝补。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes!" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she folded both hands over his arm, and looked up at him with an expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk through life beside him, even though she had no better shelter than the old umbrella, if he carried it.</div>

Little they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the magical moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain, wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven. The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss. While Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been there, and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other lot. Of course, she was the first to speak -- intelligibly, I mean, for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous "Oh, yes!" were not of a coherent or reportable character.</div>
