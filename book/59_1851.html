<div class="line_en">Grace saw them first. Her mother was cooking breakfast in the kitchen, and her father was turning off the lantern. Grace was still looking out of her window through the telescope. For a second she saw a man on top of the rock, then she could not see him behind the waves. But a minute later she saw him again -- and there were two men this time. They stood together and waved wildly. Then the rain came, and she could see nothing. But perhaps there were four, or five? She put down the telescope and called her father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格雷丝最先看到了他们。她的母亲在厨房做早餐，父亲熄灯去了。格雷丝还在透过望远镜向窗外远望。有一会儿她看见礁石顶上有一个人，接着海浪挡住，她就看不见他了。但是片刻之后，她又看见他了——而且这次是两个人。他们站在一起，发疯似的挥着手。接着下起雨来，她就什么都看不到了。但也许那里有四个人，或者五个？她放下望远镜，呼叫父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Grace's mother came into the room, and heard him. "You can't go, William!" she said. "Grace is only a girl. Look at that sea! You'll both drown!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Thomasin Darling looked out of the window again, at the wild, angry sea. She shook her head. "Perhaps you'll get to the rock, Grace," she said. "With God's help and the wind behind you. But you'll never get back against the wind. Not one man and a girl in a storm like this. Never."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马辛·达林又看了一眼窗外狂野汹涌的大海。她摇摇头。“也许你们到得了那块礁石，格雷丝，”她说，“在上帝的帮助和风力的推动下到达那里。但是顶着风，你们永远都回不来了。一个男人加一个姑娘，在这样的暴风骤雨中是绝对办不到的。绝对不行。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, in the terrible wind and the rain, it took them fifteen minutes to get the boat ready. Three times the waves nearly broke the boat on the rock. William got in first, and sat at the front. Grace and her mother held the boat away from the rocks. William got two oars ready, and waited for the next wave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们顶着外面的狂风暴雨，花了十五分钟才将船备好。有三次大浪几乎将船撞毁在礁石上。威廉先上了船，坐在船头。格雷丝和她母亲拉着船不让它撞到礁石。威廉准备好两只桨，等待着下一浪的来临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right, Grace! Get in now!" he shouted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，格雷丝！上船，现在！”他喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grace jumped into the boat, and William pulled hard with the oars. One… two… three pulls, and then a wave lifted the boat and the oars were pulling at air. But they were away from the rocks. The boat came down between two waves, and Grace quickly got her oars out. They both pulled hard together, but carefully too. They did not want to lose an oar in the wild water. Grace was cold and her dress and hat were wet. She was afraid, but happy and excited too. "This is what God wants me to do," she thought. At the top of a wave she could easily see across the Longstone rock to the other side. Then the boat went down between the waves and she could see only mountains of wild water everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格雷丝跳上船，威廉用力划桨。一下…两下…三下，突然一个巨浪将船身托起，船桨划在了空气中。但他们离开了礁石。船下落到两股波涛之间，格雷丝迅速将她的桨拿出来划。他俩一同奋力地划着桨，不过也很小心翼翼，因为他们可不愿意在这样的巨浪里丢失船桨。格雷丝很冷，她的衣服和帽子全湿了。她很害怕，但同时也快乐和兴奋。“这是上帝要我做的事情。”她心想。在浪尖上时，她可以轻易地看到长石岛另一边的礁石。接着船落到两股海浪之间，她就只能看到四周山一样的巨浪。">查看中文翻译</div>
