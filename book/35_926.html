<div class="line_en">"I'll try and save you, friends," Father Brian said, his voice still a whisper, "but you must be quick and do as I say. There are soldiers arrived, twenty, even thirty, with a will to hunt you down. They already have the older Saxon brother trapped, but he's a lively one and keeps them occupied, giving you a chance of escape. Be still, boy, stay with me!" Edwin was moving to the window, but Father Brian had reached out and clasped his arm. "I mean to lead you to safety, but we must first leave this chamber unseen. Soldiers cross the square below, but their eyes are on the tower where the Saxon still holds out. With God's help they won't notice us go down the steps outside, and then the worst will be behind us. But cause no sound to make their gazes turn, and take care not to trip on the steps. I'll descend first, then signal your moment to follow. No, mistress, you must leave your bundle here. Let it be enough to keep your lives!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was still the depths of night, but voices were calling outside and surely torches had been lit in the courtyard below, for there were now illuminated patches on the wall facing the window. The monk who had awoken them was dragging the boy, still half asleep, over to their side, and Axl recognised Father Brian's limping gait before his face emerged from the dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">A hand had been shaking him, but by the time Axl sat up the figure was already on the other side of the room, bending over Edwin and whispering, "Quickly, boy, quickly!

<div class="line_en">They crouched near the door and listened to Father Brian's footsteps descend with agonising slowness. Eventually, when Axl peered cautiously through the doorway, he saw torches moving at the far end of the courtyard; but before he could discern clearly what was going on, his attention was drawn by Father Brian, standing directly below and signalling frantically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们缩在门边，听着布莱恩神父下楼的脚步声，他走得极慢，对大家简直是煎熬。最后，埃克索小心翼翼朝门外望去，看见火把在院子较远的那一边移动；他还没来得及仔细看看是怎么回事，布莱恩神父先吸引了他的注意力，他就站在正下方，拼命打着手势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Follow close behind me, princess," Axl said. "Don't look across the yard, but keep your eyes on where your foot may find the next step, or it'll be a hard fall and only enemies to come to our aid. Tell the boy what I've just said, and let's have this behind us."</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite his own instructions, Axl could not help glancing across the courtyard as he went down. On the far side, soldiers had gathered around a cylindrical stone tower overlooking the building in which the monks had earlier had their meeting. Blazing torches were being waved, and there appeared to be disorder in their ranks. When Axl was halfway down the steps, two soldiers broke away and came running across the square, and he was sure they would be spotted. But the men vanished into a doorway, and before long Axl was gratefully ushering both Beatrice and Edwin into the shadows of the cloisters where Father Brian was waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索虽然发了指令，自己下楼的时候却忍不住朝院子那边望。院子较远的那一侧有一座圆柱形的石塔，俯瞰僧侣们之前开会的那幢建筑，士兵聚集在石塔周围，明亮的火把晃动着，队伍中似乎有些混乱。埃克索下了一半台阶的时候，两名士兵突然离开队伍，往广场这边跑，他觉得这下子肯定要被发现。不过，那两名士兵从一个门里进去，消失了；埃克索心里谢天谢地，领着比特丽丝和埃德温进入回廊的阴影之中，布莱恩神父在那儿等着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They followed the monk along narrow corridors, some of which may have been the same as those taken earlier with the silent Father Ninian. Often they moved through complete darkness, following the rhythmic hiss of their guide's dragged foot. Then they came into a chamber whose ceiling had partly fallen away. Moonlight was pouring in, revealing piles of wooden boxes and broken furniture. Axl could smell mould and stagnant water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们跟在僧侣后面，沿着狭窄的通道走，其中有些通道，静默的尼尼安神父之前可能带他们走过。路上常常漆黑一片，向导拖着一只脚，发出簌簌声，大家只能跟着这声音走。然后他们来到一个房间，一部分屋顶已经塌了。月光洒进来，照着一堆堆的木头箱子和破旧家具。埃克索闻到了霉菌和死水潭的气味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Take heart, friends," Father Brian said, no longer whispering. He had gone into a corner and was moving objects aside. "You're nearly safe."</div>

<div class="line_en">Father Brian continued clearing the corner, and did not look up as he said: "A mystery to us, sir. They came this night without invitation, pouring through the gates and through our home as if it were their own. They demanded the two young Saxons lately arrived here, and though they made no mention of you or your wife, I wouldn't trust them to treat you gently. This boy here, they would clearly wish to murder, as they do even now his brother. You must save yourselves and there'll be time later to ponder the soldiers' ways."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布莱恩神父继续清理那个角落，眼睛也没抬，口中回答道：“先生，这对我们也是个谜。他们今晚不请自来，拥进大门，拥进我们家里，好像这是他们的地方一样。他们说，要抓刚到的这两个撒克逊年轻人，没提到你和你妻子，但我不相信他们会友好地对待你们。这个男孩呢，他们显然是想要他的命，就像他们现在追杀他哥哥一样。你们先要脱离危险，以后有时间慢慢去寻思这些士兵的行为。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And if that fellow bravely buys your escape, even with his own life, you must grasp it gratefully. Under this trap-door is a tunnel dug in ancient times. It will take you underground into the forest, where you'll emerge far from your pursuers. Now help me raise it, sir, for it's too heavy for my hands alone."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="通向地下的台阶很平缓——扁平的石块嵌在泥土中——踩上去也比较牢固。头顶的暗门开着，有一些光亮，他们能看到一点前方的路。但是，就在埃克索转身对布莱恩神父说话的时候，暗门关上了，传来轰隆一声巨响，如同雷鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Beatrice spoke to him, a change seemed to come over the boy. He kept staring at the hole in the floor, and his eyes, caught in the moonlight, seemed to Axl at that moment to have something strange about them, as though he were steadily coming under a spell. Then even as Beatrice was speaking, Edwin walked towards the trap-door and without looking back at them, stepped into the blackness and vanished. As his footsteps grew fainter, Axl took Beatrice's hand and said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比特丽丝跟男孩说话的时候，男孩身上似乎发生了什么变化。他一直盯着地板上那个洞，月光反射在他眼睛里，那一刻在埃克索看来，男孩的眼睛里有种奇怪的东西，好像他慢慢进入了魔咒之中一样。比特丽丝还在说话，埃德温便迈步朝暗门走去，没有回头看大家，直接进了那个黑洞，消失了。他的脚步声渐渐远去，埃克索拉住比特丽丝的手，说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all three stopped and for a while remained quite still. The air did not feel as stale as Axl had expected; in fact he thought he could feel a faint breeze.

<div class="line_en">"Queer right enough. But there's no doubting there's soldiers in the monastery, for didn't we see them ourselves just now? I don't see what choice we have but to go on and pray this tunnel brings us safely to the forest. Tell the boy to keep moving forward, but slowly and always a hand to this mossy wall, for I fear this passage will only grow darker."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是有些奇怪。但修道院里来了士兵，这一点确定无疑，我们刚才不是都看到了吗？我看我们也没别的选择了，只能继续往前走，希望这条路能安全地通到树林。告诉男孩继续往前走，但是要慢一点，一只手要一直扶着这长满青苔的墙，我担心前面只会越来越暗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The boy asks why Father Brian closed the door on us as he did. I told him he was most likely anxious to hide the tunnel from the soldiers maybe even now entering the room. All the same, Axl, it struck me a little queer too. And isn't that him now, surely, moving objects over the door? If we find the way ahead obstructed by earth or water, the father himself saying it's years since anyone came this way, how will we return and open that door, the way it's so heavy and now with objects above it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“男孩问，为什么布莱恩神父在后面把门给关上了。我跟他说，他很可能是急着把洞口藏起来，也许现在那些士兵已经进了房间。可是啊，埃克索，这事我也觉得有些奇怪。你听，那肯定是他吧，在搬东西把门压住？神父自己说，通道很多年没人走了，如果前面有泥土或者水挡路，我们回去怎么开门呢？门那么重，现在上面又压了东西？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet as they went forward they found there was a feeble light, so that at times they could even make out each other's outlines. There were sudden puddles that surprised their feet, and more than once during this phase of their journey, Axl thought he heard a noise up ahead, but since neither Edwin nor Beatrice reacted he put it down to his overwrought imagination. But then Edwin suddenly halted, almost causing Axl to collide into him. He felt Beatrice behind him squeeze his hand, and for a moment they stood there very still in the dark. Then Beatrice moved even closer to him, and her breath felt warm on his neck as she said in the softest of whispers: "Do you hear it, Axl?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，他们再往前走，发现有一线微弱的光，有时甚至还能分辨出彼此的轮廓。脚下不时会有水坑，吓人一跳，而且在这段路上，埃克索不止一次感觉头顶上有声音，但埃德温和比特丽丝都没什么反应，他也就当作是自己想象出来的，不去理睬了。后来埃德温突然停下脚步，埃克索差点都撞到了他身上。他感到身后的比特丽丝捏紧了他的手，有一刻，他们就这样静静地在黑暗中站着。比特丽丝贴得更紧了，他的脖子能感觉到她的气息，她用极低的声音说：“你听到了没，埃克索？”">查看中文翻译</div>

But their plans for the boy, and for an innocent Christian couple, I could not allow it! Luckily not all the monks think alike, you know, and Ninian, the silent one, led me down here unwatched.

Axl did his best to hold the candle high, but the breeze in the tunnel was now stronger, and he was often obliged to lower it and cover the flame with his other hand.

<div class="line_en">Despite his counsel, Sir Gawain had doubled back, and Edwin too was now at Beatrice's side. Axl crouched forward and moved the candle here and there, revealing damp earth, tree roots and stones. Then the flame illuminated a large bat lying on its back as though peacefully asleep, wings stretched right out. Its fur looked wet and sticky. The pig-like face was hairless, and little puddles had formed in the cavities of the outspread wings. The creature might indeed have been sleeping but for what was on the front of its torso. As Axl brought the flame even closer, they all stared at the circular hole extending from just below the bat's breast down to its belly, taking in parts of the ribcage to either side. The wound was peculiarly clean, as though someone had taken a bite from a crisp apple.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sir Gawain broke off, interrupted by a noise from further down the tunnel. It was hard to determine how distant or near it had been, but the sound was unmistakably the cry of a beast; it had resembled the howl of a wolf, though there had also been something of the deeper roar of a bear. The cry had not been prolonged, but it made Axl clasp Beatrice to him, and Sir Gawain snatched his sword from out of the ground. Then, for several moments, they remained standing in silence, listening for the sound to return. But nothing further came, and suddenly Sir Gawain began to laugh, quietly and breathlessly. As his laughter went on, Beatrice said into Axl's ear: "Let's leave this place, husband. I wish no more reminding of this lonely grave."</div>

<div class="line_en">They all paused to recover their breaths and look around at their new surroundings. After the long walk with the earth brushing their heads, it was a relief to see the ceiling not only so high above them, but composed of more solid material. Once Sir Gawain had lit the candle again, Axl realised they were in some sort of mausoleum, surrounded by walls bearing traces of murals and Roman letters. Before them a pair of substantial pillars formed a gateway into a further chamber of comparable proportions, and falling across this threshold was an intense pool of moonlight. Its source was not obvious: perhaps somewhere behind the high arch crossing the two pillars there was an opening which at that moment, by sheer chance, was aligned to receive the moon. The light illuminated much of the moss and fungus on the pillars, as well as a section of the next chamber, whose floor appeared to be covered in rubble, but which Axl soon realised was comprised of a vast layer of bones. Only then did it occur to him that under his feet were more broken skeletons, and that this strange floor extended for the entirety of both chambers.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Exactly, sir. This gate isn't so ancient. Younger than either of us, I'd wager. Someone has raised it for us, wishing us to pass through. See there, the ropes that hold it. And there, the pulleys. Someone comes here often to make this gate rise and fall, and perhaps feed the beast." Sir Gawain stepped towards one of the pillars, his feet crunching over bones. "If I cut this rope, the gate will surely come down, it will bar our way out. Yet if the beast's beyond, we'll be shielded from it. Is that the Saxon boy I hear or some pixie stolen in here?"</div>

But there was no sign of the beast, and after a moment they all let go their breaths.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had spoken softly, but Sir Gawain turned to them. "What do you suggest, mistress? That I committed this slaughter?" He said this tiredly, with none of the anger he had shown earlier in the tunnel, but there was a peculiar intensity in his voice. "So many skulls, you say. Yet are we not underground? What is it you suggest? Can just one knight of Arthur have killed so many?" He turned back to the gate and ran a finger along one of the bars. "Once, years ago, in a dream, I watched myself killing the enemy. It was in my sleep and long ago. The enemy, in their hundreds, perhaps as many as this. I fought and I fought. Just a foolish dream, but still I recall it." He sighed, then looked at Beatrice. "I hardly know how to answer you, mistress. I acted as I thought would please God. How was I to guess how dark had grown the hearts of these wretched monks? Horace and I came to this monastery while the sun was up, not long after you yourself arrived, for I supposed then I had need to speak urgently with the abbot. Then I discovered what he plotted against you, and I feigned complacence. I bade him farewell, and they all believed me gone, but I left Horace in the forest and returned up here on foot hidden by the night. Not all the monks think alike, thank God. I knew the good Jonus would receive me. And learning from him the abbot's schemes, I had Ninian bring me unseen down to this place to await you. Curse it, the boy starts again!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她声音不大，可高文爵士转过头来说：“你这是什么意思，夫人？难道是说人是我杀的？”他的声音很疲惫，没有之前在隧道里说话时的怒气，但有一种特别强烈的情绪。“你说，这么多头骨。可我们不是在地下吗？你这是什么意思呢？一名亚瑟王的骑士，能杀得了这么多？”他转过身，对着闸门，一根指头从上到下摸着一根铁条。“过去，很多年前，我在梦里看到自己杀敌人。那是在梦里，很久以前的事了。敌人呢，有好几百，也许和这儿的人数差不多。我就一直拼杀、拼杀。不过是个愚蠢的梦，但我现在还能想起来。”他叹了口气，然后看看比特丽丝。“我都不知道该怎么回答你，夫人。我以为这样做，会令上帝喜悦。我怎么能猜到，这些卑鄙的僧侣竟然心黑到这个地步？我和霍拉斯到修道院时，太阳还没落山，你们也刚到不久，因为那时候我想，我必须尽快告诉院长。后来我发现他要对付你们，就假装出得意的样子。我跟他告别，他们都以为我走了，实际上我把霍拉斯丢在树林里，趁着夜色又走上了山。感谢上帝，不是所有僧侣都那么想。我知道好心的乔纳斯会接待我。我从他那儿知道了院长的计划，就让尼尼安悄悄带我到这儿来，等着你们。该死，这男孩又来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed it was hard to believe the severed head was not a living thing. It lay on its side, the one visible eye gleaming like a sea creature. The jaws moved rhythmically with a strange energy, so that the tongue, flopping amidst the teeth, appeared to stir with life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确，很难相信这砍下的脑袋不是个活东西。野兽的头侧面着地，能看到一只眼睛，仍旧亮闪闪的，像海里的动物那样。上下颚有节奏地动着，似乎有罕见的力气，舌头因此在嘴巴里一起一落，好像是活的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a kind of daze, Axl came upon a cluster of roots rising between two large trees, and taking Beatrice's hand, helped her sit down on it. At first Beatrice was too short of breath to speak, but after a moment she looked up, saying:</div>

<div class="line_en">The second chamber of the mausoleum showed clear signs of having served as the beast's lair: amidst the ancient bones were fresher carcasses of sheep and deer, as well as other dark, foul-smelling shapes they could not identify. Then they were once more walking stooped and short of breath along a winding passage. They encountered no more beasts, and eventually they heard birdsong. A patch of light appeared in the distance, and then they came out into the forest, the early dawn all around them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="陵墓的第二个房间，显然是野兽的巢穴：古老的骨头之中，有新近的羊和鹿的骨架，还有一些骨架是黑色的，气味难闻，他们无法辨认。随后他们又必须弯着腰、屏着气，走过一条曲折的通道。他们没有遇到野兽，最后终于听到了鸟鸣声。远处出现一块光亮，不久大家来到一片树林中，四下里晨曦初亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
