<div class="line_en">We made our flight with seconds to spare, and then the true torture began. The plane sat idle on the tarmac while the flight attendants strolled -- so casually -- up and down the aisle, patting the bags in the overhead compartments to make sure everything fit. The pilots leaned out of the cockpit, chatting with them as they passed. Alice's hand was hard on my shoulder, holding me in my seat while I bounced anxiously up and down.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不行，你不能这样做。”爱丽丝把声音压得很低，使我离她非常近几乎听不到，于是，我更加用心听，“告诉埃美特……好吧，跟着埃美特和罗莎莉，把他们带回来好好考虑一下，贾斯帕。如果他看见我们当中的任何一个，你想他会怎么做？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The first I told him. We could try to stop Edward ourselves -- if Emmett could get his hands on him, we might be able to stop him long enough to convince him you're alive. But we can't sneak up on Edward. And if he sees us coming for him, he'll just act that much faster. He'll throw a Buiclc through a wall or something, and the Volturi will take him down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个我跟他说了。我们能亲自阻止爱德华——如果埃美特拖住他的话。我们会有足够的时间说服他你还活着，但是我们不能跟踪爱德华。如果他知道我们来找他，他会加快行动的。他会把一辆别克朝墙上砸去，那么沃尔图里就会抓住他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's the second reason of course, the reason I couldn't say to Jasper. Because if they're there and the Volturi kill Edward, they'll fight them. Bella." She opened her eyes and stared at me, beseeching. "If there were any chance we could win… if there were a way that the four of us could save my brother by fighting for him, maybe it would be different. But we can't, and, Bella, I can't lose Jasper like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二个原因，我不能告诉贾斯帕，因为他们在场，如果沃尔图里杀死爱德华的话，他们会打起来的，贝拉。”她睁开眼睛看着我，恳求道，“如果我们侥幸能赢……如果我们四个人能救回我哥哥，事情就完全不同了。但是，我们不能，贝拉，我不能让贾斯帕这么白白牺牲。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not that there was any justification, either way. I still couldn't believe that he was capable of reacting like this. It made no sense! I remembered with painful clarity his words that day on the sofa, while we watched Romeo and Juliet kill themselves, one after the other. I wasn't going to live without you, he'd said, as if it should be such an obvious conclusion. But the words he had spoken in the forest as he'd left me had canceled all that out -- forcefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁也没有任何解释。我还是不能相信他会这么做。完全没有道理！我很清楚地记着那天我们坐在沙发上一起看罗密欧与朱丽叶一前一后的自杀。他说，你死了我也不要独自活着！好像这就是最后的结果，但是她在森林里离开我时说的话硬是把所有的一切给否定掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If he were listening," she explained. "But believe it or not, it's possible to lie with your thoughts. If you had died, I would still try to stop him. And I would be thinking 'she's alive, she's alive' as hard as I could. He knows that."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谁是沃尔图里？”我小声问，“他们为什么比埃美特、贾斯帕、罗莎莉还有你可怕？”很难想象比这更可怕地事物了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled a grim smile. "I promised him I would get out before they killed me, too. It's not something I can guarantee -- not by a long shot." She raised her eyebrows, as if willing me to take the danger more seriously.</div>

<div class="line_en">She took a deep breath, and then abruptly leveled a dark glance over my shoulder. I turned in time to see the man in the aisle seat looking away as if he wasn't listening to us.

<div class="line_en">"You have to understand," she said, her voice slower, more measured now. "We Cullens are unique in more ways than you know. It's… abnormal for so many of us to live together in peace. It's the same for Tanya's family in the north, and Carlisle speculates that abstaining makes it easier for us to be civilized, to form bonds based on love rather than survival or convenience. Even James's little coven of three was unusually large -- and you saw how easily Laurent left them. Our kind travel alone, or in pairs, as a general rule. Carlisle's family is the biggest in existence, as far as I know, with the one exception. The Volturi.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须明白，”她说着，把声音降得更低，更小心翼翼，“我们卡伦家族比你想象的更加神秘。我们这么多人和平共处是不太寻常的。北方的坦尼娅家族一样。卡莱尔认为是自我克制让我们变的文明，使我们能把关系建立在相爱而不是为了生存和寻求便利的基础上。即便是詹姆斯的三女巫聚在一起都嫌人多——你可以明白为什么劳伦这么轻易地就离开了她们。我们一般单独行动，或者俩人结伴。据我所知，卡莱尔家族是目前最大的，当然是出了另外一个，这另一个就是沃尔图里家族。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He just said they were an old, powerful family -- like royalty. That you didn't antagonize them unless you wanted to… die," I whispered. The last word was hard to choke out.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们一开始就三个人，阿罗、凯厄思和马库斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice nodded. "Two females joined them over time, and the five of them make up the family. I'm not sure, but I suspect that their age is what gives them the ability to live peacefully together. They are well over three thousand years old. Or maybe it's their gifts that give them extra tolerance. Like Edward and I, Aro and Marcus are… talented."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝点点头：“后来有两个女人加入他们，他们五个人后来组成了家庭。我不是很清楚，但是我想他们能够和谐相处是因为年龄相仿吧。他们都有三千多岁了。或者是他们的才能使他们彼此相互忍耐，就像爱德华和我一样，阿罗和马库斯也是……法力不凡的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“明白，爱丽丝。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sound that escaped out of my mouth was very quiet, but Alice seemed to understand that it was a cry of pain. She wrapped her thin, strong arm around my shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发出很轻的声音，但是爱丽丝好像听出我的痛苦，用瘦长而有力的手臂挽着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't anticipate anything, either. Maybe, if I were very, very, very lucky, I would somehow be able to save Edward. But I wasn't so stupid as to think that saving him would mean that I could stay with him. I was no different, no more special than I'd been before. There would be no new reason for him to want me now. Seeing him and losing him again…</div>

<div class="line_en">After an eternity, the plane began to descend toward New York City. Alice remained in her trance. I dithered, reaching out to touch her, only to pull my hand back again. This happened a dozen times before the plane touched town with a jarring impact.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had to run for our connection, but that was good -- better than having to wait. As soon as the plane was in the air, Alice closed her eyes and slid back into the same stupor as before. I waited as patiently as I could. When it was dark again, I opened the window to stare out into the flat black that was no better than the window shade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们必须赶去换机，这样很好——比干等着好。飞机一起飞，爱丽丝就和之前一样，以同样的姿势闭上眼睛，我耐心地等待着。天黑了，我打开窗户看着外面和遮光板一样黑的天空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alice," I finally said. "Alice, we have to go." I touched her arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was grateful that I'd had so many months' practice with controlling my thoughts. Instead of dwelling on the terrifying possibilities that, no matter what Alice said, I did not intend to survive, I concentrated on lesser problems. Like, what I was going to say to Charlie if I got back:' That was a thorny enough problem to occupy several hours. And Jacob? He'd promised to wait for me, but did that promise still apply? Would I end up home alone in Forks, with no one at all? Maybe I didn't want to survive, no matter what happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真庆幸我训练了还几个月如何控制我的思想，虽然不管爱丽丝怎么安慰，我并不打算活着离开，但我控制住自己不去想这些恐怖的可能性，相反我开始想一些小的问题。比如，回到家后，我要怎么对查理说？这个问题够我想上几个小时了。还有雅各布怎么办？他答应过等我，但是这个承诺还有效吗？我会一个人住在福克斯，孤独终老吗？也许我根本不想活下去了，不管发生什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

The longer he spends on his plans, the better for us."</div>

<div class="line_en">I probably should have watched out the window as first the city of Florence and then the Tuscan landscape flashed past with blurring speed. This was my first trip anywhere, and maybe my last, too. But Alice's driving frightened me, despite the fact that I knew I could trust her behind the wheel. And I was too tortured with anxiety to really see the hills or the walled towns that looked like castles in the distance.</div>

<div class="line_en">She chuckled darkly. "The city holds a celebration every year. As the legend goes, a Christian missionary, a Father Marcus -- Marcus of the Voltun, in fact -- drove all the vampires from Volterra fifteen hundred years ago. The story claims he was martyred in Romania, still trying to drive away the vampire scourge. Of course that's nonsense -- he's never left the city. But that's where some of the superstitions about things like crosses and garlic come from. Father Marcus used them so successfully. And vampires don't trouble Volterra, so they must work." Her smile was sardonic. "It's become more of a celebration of the city, and recognition for the police force -- after all, Volterra is an amazingly safe city. The police get the credit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她冷笑道：“这个城市每年都要庆祝这一节日。传说一个基督徒传教士、沃尔图里的马库斯神父一千五百年前把所有的吸血鬼逐出沃特拉城，传说他在罗马尼亚驱逐吸血鬼过程中牺牲了。当然是一派胡言，他从未离开过这座城市，但是一些迷信就是这么来的，像关于十字架和大蒜的迷信。马库斯神父很会利用这些。吸血鬼没有再骚扰沃特拉城，所以它们见效了。”她的笑声变成嘲讽，“节日逐渐变成了城市的庆典，表达对警察的敬仰——不管怎么说，沃特拉是座很安全的城市，警察功不可没。”">查看中文翻译</div>
