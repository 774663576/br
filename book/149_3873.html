<div class="line_en">Blomkvist had once listened to a lecture by the writer Karl Alvar Nilsson at the ABF hall on the anniversary of the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme. The lecture was serious, and in the audience were Lennart Bodström and other friends of Palme's. But a surprising number of amateur investigators had turned up. One of them was a woman in her forties who during the Q and A had taken the proffered microphone and then lowered her voice to a barely audible whisper. This alone heralded an interesting development, and nobody was surprised when the woman began by claiming, "I know who murdered Olof Palme." From the stage it was suggested somewhat ironically that if the woman had this information then it would be helpful if she shared it with the Palme investigation at once. She hurried to reply: "I can't," she said so softly it was almost impossible to hear. "It's too dangerous!"</div>

An industrialist and former head of the Vanger companies, once renowned in the fields of sawmills, mines, steel, metals, textiles. Vanger had been one of the really big fish in his day, with a reputation for being an honourable, old-fashioned patriarch who would not bend in a strong wind. A cornerstone of Swedish industry, one of the twenty-point stags of the old school, along with Matts Carlgren of MoDo and Hans Werthén at the old Electrolux.

<div class="line_en">On Christmas night there had been a big snowstorm, but the skies had now cleared and the air was ice-cold when Blomkvist alighted at Hedestad. He realised at once that he wasn't wearing enough clothes for winter in Norrland. Frode knew what he looked like and kindly collected him from the platform and led him straight to the warmth of his Mercedes. In the centre of Hedestad, snow clearing was in full swing, and Frode wove his careful way through the narrow streets. High banks of snow presented a picturesque contrast to Stockholm. The town seemed almost like another planet, yet he was only a little more than three hours from Sergels Torg in downtown Stockholm. He stole a glance at the lawyer: an angular face with sparse, bristly white hair and thick glasses perched on an impressive nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞夜，这里下了场暴风雪，但现在天空已经清朗了，当布隆维斯特在赫德史塔下车时，呼吸到的是冰冷的空气，他立刻发觉自己身上的衣物不足以抵挡诺兰的寒冬。弗洛德认得他，亲切地到月台迎接他，直接带他坐上暖和的奔驰车。赫德史塔镇上正在全力清理积雪，弗洛德小心翼翼地在狭窄街道间穿梭。高高堆起的白雪呈现出与斯德哥尔摩全然不同的景致。这座小镇距离斯德哥尔摩市中心的赛格尔广场也不过三个小时多一点的车程，却仿佛到了外星球。他偷偷瞅律师一眼：一张瘦削的脸，稀疏白发理成小平头，大大的鼻子上架着厚重的眼镜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The road into Hedeby was still unploughed, and Frode manoeuvred the car down frozen tyre ruts. The old town centre consisted of houses along the Gulf of Bothnia, and around them larger, more modern homes. The town began on the mainland and spilled across a bridge to a hilly island. On the mainland side of the bridge stood a small, white stone church, and across the street glowed an old-fashioned neon sign that read SUSANNE'S BRIDGE CAFé AND BAKERY. Frode drove about a hundred yards farther and turned left on to a newly shovelled courtyard in front of a stone building. The farmhouse was too small to be called a manor, but it was considerably larger than the rest of the houses in the settlement. This was the master's domain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往海泽比道路上的积雪尚未清除，弗洛德只得循着结冰的辙迹前进。旧城区的房子沿着波的尼亚湾①建，外围则是较大、较现代化的住家。小镇范围从大陆往外延伸，越过一座桥到一个山丘起伏的小岛。在大陆这端的桥头有一栋小小的白色石砌教堂，对街有一面写着“苏珊桥头咖啡糕饼屋”的旧式霓虹招牌在闪闪发亮。弗洛德大约又开了百来公尺后，左转进入一栋石屋前刚铲过雪的庭院。石屋农舍规模太小称不上庄园，但比起四周其他房舍已经大得多，显然属于主人所有。【注：①波的尼亚湾（Gulf of Bothnia），位于瑞典东岸与芬兰西岸之间的海湾。】">查看中文翻译</div>

The last time I saw him was the year before he died, and he told me then that you had got into journalism school. He was extremely proud.

<div class="line_en">The old man must have thought long and hard how he was going to hook him. Blomkvist had the feeling that every last thing that had happened since he arrived was staged: the introductory surprise that as a child he had met his host, the picture of his parents in the album, and the emphasis on the fact that his father and Vanger had been friends, along with the flattery that the old man knew who Mikael Blomkvist was and that he had been following his career for years from a distance… No doubt it had a core of truth, but it was also pretty elementary psychology. Vanger was a practised manipulator -- how else had he become one of Sweden's leading industrialists?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个老人必然是绞尽脑汁要钓他上钩。布隆维斯特有种感觉，从他到达以后所发生的每件事都经过设计：一开始是他幼时曾见过主人的意外消息，接着是相簿中双亲的照片，范耶尔并一再强调他与父亲友好的事实，最后还恭维地表示知道麦可·布隆维斯特是何许人，多年来也一直远远地留意他的表现……这其中无疑有几分真实，但主要还是打心理战。范耶尔善于操控人心——否则他又怎能成为瑞典数一数二的企业领袖？">查看中文翻译</div>

Twenty-five years ago the Vanger concern was a serious competitor to the Wallenberg Group. We had forty thousand employees in Sweden. Today many of these jobs are in Korea or Brazil.

<div class="line_en">"In 1939 the Second World War began, and in 1940 the Winter War in Finland. A large number of the Lindholm movement joined as Finland volunteers. Richard was one of them and by then a captain in the Swedish army. He was killed in February 1940-- just before the peace treaty with the Soviet Union -- and thereby became a martyr in the Nazi movement and had a battle group named after him. Even now a handful of idiots gather at a cemetery in Stockholm on the anniversary of his death to honour him."</div>

During the first half of the thirties, my brother sent his wife and child here to Hedestad while he was stationed with his regiment in Gävle. In his free time he travelled around and did proselytising for Nazism. In 1936 he had a huge fight with my father which resulted in my father cutting him off.

<div class="line_en">"Correct. In the late forties Gottfried met a German woman by the name of Isabella Koenig, who had come to Sweden after the war. She was quite a beauty -- I mean that she had a lovely radiance like Garbo or Ingrid Bergman. Harriet probably got more of her genes from her mother rather than from Gottfried. As you can see from the photograph, she was pretty even at fourteen."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My father didn't really know how to deal with his grandson, so I was the one who gave him a job in the company. This was after the war. He did try to do a reasonable job, but he was lazy. He was a charmer and good-time Charlie; he had a way with women, and there were periods when he drank too much. It isn't easy to describe my feelings for him… he wasn't a good-for-nothing, but he was not the least bit reliable and he often disappointed me deeply. Over the years he turned into an alcoholic, and in 1965 he died -- the victim of an accidental drowning. That happened at the other end of Hedeby Island, where he'd had a cabin built, and where he used to hide away to drink."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But let me continue. Isabella was born in 1928 and is still alive. She was eleven when the war began, and you can imagine what it was like to be a teenager in Berlin during the aerial bombardments. It must have felt as if she had arrived in paradise on earth when she landed in Sweden. Regrettably she shared many of Gottfried's vices; she was lazy and partied incessantly. She travelled a great deal in Sweden and abroad, and lacked all sense of responsibility. Obviously this affected the children. Martin was born in 1948 and Harriet in 1950. Their childhood was chaotic, with a mother who was forever leaving them and a father who was virtually an alcoholic.</div>

I looked on her as my own daughter, and she ended up being closer to me than to her parents. You see, Harriet was very special. She was introverted -- like her brother -- and as a teenager she became wrapped up in religion, unlike anyone else in the family. But she had a clear talent and she was tremendously intelligent. She had both morals and backbone. When she was fourteen or fifteen I was convinced that she was the one -- and not her brother or any of the mediocre cousins, nephews, and nieces around me -- who was destined to run the Vanger business one day, or at least play a central role in it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“海莉是我的心肝宝贝。我试图想给她安全感、为她建立自信，我们的互动非常密切。我把她当亲生女儿，后来她跟我比跟她父母更亲。你要知道，海莉是非常特殊的。她很内向——和她哥哥一样——才十几岁就热衷于宗教，这可是这个家族里绝无仅有。但是她显然天赋异禀，也绝顶聪明，而且道德感与骨气兼具。她十四五岁时，我便确信她将来注定要接掌范耶尔的事业，而不是她哥哥或其他那些围绕在我周遭、才能平庸的表兄弟与侄孙辈，否则至少也会扮演重要角色。”">查看中文翻译</div>
