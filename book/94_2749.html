<div class="line_en">She has a shower so hot her skin feels as if it's about to come away from her flesh like clementine peel. Walks out into the flat. Mum left home hours ago. She's gone to fix everything, because that is what Mum does.</div>

<div class="line_en">George calls out something behind Elsa, but she neither listens nor answers. She puts on the clothes that Mum has put out for her and crosses the landing, locking the front door behind her. Granny's flat smells wrong. It smells clean. The towers of packing boxes throw shadows across the entry hall, like monuments to everything that is now absent.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stands inside the door, incapable of going any farther. She was here last night, but it's more difficult by daylight. It's harder work remembering things when the sun is forcing its way in through the blinds. Cloud animals soar past in the sky. It's a beautiful morning but a terrible day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站在门的内侧，再也无法往里迈进一步。她昨晚也在，但白天待在这里更难过。阳光强硬地透过百叶窗照进来，回忆变得更加困难。云兽在天空翱翔。这是一个美丽的早晨，却是可怕的一天。">查看中文翻译</div>

She roars silently and reaches out with her hand to toss aside the bedclothes, but they're already on the floor. She walks into the flat -- it smells of eggs. George smiles carefully at her from the kitchen. She doesn't smile back. He looks upset. She doesn't care.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa's skin is still burning after her shower. It makes her think of Granny, because Granny's shower hasn't worked in over a year, and instead of calling the landlord and asking him to fix the problem, she just used Mum and George's shower. And sometimes she forgot to do up her dressing gown when she went back through the flat. And sometimes she forgot her dressing gown altogether. Once, Mum shouted at her for what must have been fifteen minutes because she didn't show any respect about George also living in Mum and Elsa's flat. But that was soon after Elsa had starting reading the collected works of Charles Dickens. Granny was not much use at reading books, so Elsa used to read them to her while they were driving Renault, because Elsa wanted to have someone she could discuss them with afterwards. Especially A Christmas Carol, which Elsa had read several times, because Granny liked Christmas stories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎的皮肤在淋浴之后仍在灼烧，这让她想起了外婆。外婆的淋浴器坏了差不多一年，她没去找房东解决问题，而是去妈妈和乔治家洗澡。有时她穿过房间回自己家时，忘记了系上浴袍。有时她连浴袍都忘了穿。有一次，妈妈冲她吼了足足有十五分钟，因为她对同样住在妈妈和爱莎公寓里的乔治非常不尊重。那时爱莎刚开始读查尔斯·狄更斯的文集。外婆不擅长读书，所以爱莎总是在她驾驶雷诺的时候读给她听，希望能有人一起讨论。特别是《圣诞颂歌》，爱莎读过好几遍，因为外婆喜欢圣诞节故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So when Mum said that thing about how Granny shouldn't run about naked in the flat, out of respect for George, then Granny, still naked, turned to George and said, "What's all this respect rubbish? You're cohabiting with my daughter, for goodness sake." And then Granny bowed very deeply and very nakedly and added ceremoniously: "I am the spirit of future Christmases, George!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa opens the door of the big wardrobe. The wurse licks her face. It smells of protein bars and sponge cake mix. Elsa had just gone to bed last night when she realized that Mum would most likely send George down to the cellar storage unit today to get the spare chairs, because everyone is coming here afterwards for coffee. Because today is the day, and everyone drinks coffee somewhere after days like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎打开大衣橱的门。呜嘶舔了舔她的脸，一股蛋白棒和海绵蛋糕粉的气味。爱莎昨晚刚上床就想起，今天妈妈很可能会让乔治去地下储藏室拿些备用椅子，因为结束之后每个人都会来喝咖啡。今天就是那个日子，每个人都会在这样的一天结束后去某处喝咖啡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa goes into the flat without taking off her shoes. She's wearing the kind of shoes that scratch the parquet flooring, so Mum has told her she can't wear them inside, but it doesn't matter in Granny's place, because the floor already looks as if someone went skating on it. Partly because it's old, and partly because Granny actually once went skating on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎没有脱鞋就走进房间。她那双鞋子会刮花镶木地板，所以妈妈不允许她在房间里穿鞋，但外婆的家里没关系，因为地板看上去像是已经有人在上头溜过冰了。部分原因是它很旧了，部分原因是外婆就是那个在上头溜冰的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mum was very angry at Granny about that, but she tried not to show it, for Elsa's sake. So, for Mum's sake, Elsa tried not to show how proud she was of Granny for being able to quote Charles Dickens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为这事，妈妈对外婆很生气，但她尽量不表现出来，为了爱莎。所以，为了妈妈，爱莎也尽量不表现出对外婆能够引用狄更斯的故事而感到骄傲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mum and George's cellar unit is next to Granny's unit, and it's the only storage unit you can see the wurse from now that Alf has put up the plywood sheets.

<div class="line_en">The wurse licks her face again and squeezes its head through the opening and looks for her backpack. Elsa runs to fetch it from the hall and pulls out three tins of dreams and a quart of milk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶又舔了舔她的脸，脑袋挤出来，找她的背包。爱莎去门厅把背包拿来，拿出三罐“梦想”饼干和一升牛奶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maud left them with Mum last night," Elsa explains, but when the wurse immediately starts snuffling her hands as if about to eat the cookies with the tin still around them, she raises an admonishing forefinger. "You can only have two tins! One is for ammunition!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“莫德昨晚给妈妈的。”爱莎说明道。但呜嘶立刻闻闻她的手，表示要连着罐子一起把饼干全吃掉。她伸出食指劝告说：“你只能吃两罐！一罐是‘弹药’！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There would be more space to hide you in here if Granny wasn't dead," says Elsa apologetically, because then the wardrobe wouldn't have stopped growing. "Then again, if Granny hadn't died, you wouldn't need to hide in the first place."</div>

<div class="line_en">The wurse barks at her a bit about that, but in the end recognizes its poor bargaining position and only polishes off two of the tins and half of the third. It is a wurse, after all. And these are cookies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶为此冲她吠了几下，最后认识到自己在谈判中的不利位置，只清空了两罐半。它毕竟是只呜嘶，而这些是饼干。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa takes the milk and goes looking for her moo-gun. She's a bit slow on the uptake today. Because she hasn't had any nightmares in years, she's only realizing now that she may need it. The first time the shadow came to her in the nightmare, she tried to shake it all off the next morning. As you do. Tried to persuade herself that "it was only a nightmare." But she should have known better. Because everyone who has ever been in the Land-Of-Almost-Awake knows better.</div>

When children in the Land-of-Almost-Awake are learning geography and have to reel off the names of the six kingdoms, Mirevas is the one they always forget. Even those who live there. Because the Mirevasians are incredibly humble, kindly, and cautious creatures who go to great lengths to avoid taking up unnecessary space or causing the slightest inconvenience. Yet they have a very important task, actually one of the most important tasks in a kingdom where imagination is the most important thing you can have: for it is in Mirevas that the nightmare hunters are trained.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as she's starting to feel more confident, though, she's startled by the doorbell, and to the infinite chagrin of the wurse she accidentally fires loads of milk at it but no cookie, and it scurries off in a huff.

<div class="line_en">Only smart-asses in the real world who don't know any better would say something as idiotic as "it was only a nightmare." There are no "only" nightmares -- they're living creatures, dark little clouds of insecurity and anguish that come sneaking between the houses when everyone is asleep, trying all the doors and windows to find some place to slip inside and start causing a commotion. And that is why there are nightmare hunters. And anyone who knows anything about anything knows one has to have a moo-gun to chase a nightmare. Someone who doesn't know better might mistake a moo-gun for a quite ordinary paintball gun customised by someone's granny with a milk carton at the side and a catapult glued to the top. Elsa, though, knows what she's got in her hands. She loads the carton with milk and puts a cookie in the firing chamber in front of the rubber band on the cookie gun.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa shrugs and slams the door in his face. The wurse has reappeared, so she climbs onto its back and peers out of the spyhole to see George lingering there for what must be a minute, looking upset. Elsa hates him for that. Mum always tells Elsa that George just wants her to like him because he cares. As if Elsa doesn't get that. She knows he cares, and that's why she can't like him. Not because she wouldn't like him if she tried, but rather because she knows she definitely would. Because everyone likes George. It's his superpower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎耸耸肩，“砰”的一声关上门。呜嘶又出现了，她爬上它的背，从猫眼里看着乔治在外面又待了差不多一分钟，他看上去更沮丧了。爱莎为此恨他。妈妈总对爱莎说，乔治只是想赢得爱莎的喜爱，因为他在乎她。其实爱莎都明白，而这正是爱莎不能喜欢他的原因。不是因为她做不到，而是因为她知道如果试着去做，自己一定会喜欢上他。所有人都喜欢乔治。这是他的超能力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The skin around the woman's mouth cracks again. She takes another long, deep breath, looks into Elsa's eyes and says: "I like him a lot too, that's what I wanted to say. It's been a long time since I had such an amazing reading experience. You almost never do, once you grow up, things are at their peak when you're a child and then it's all downhill from there… well… because of the cynicism, I suppose. I just wanted to thank you for reminding me of how things used to be."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女人嘴角的皮肤又起了几道皱纹。她深深吸了一口气，看着爱莎的眼睛说：“我非常喜欢他，我就想说这个。我好久都没有过这么棒的阅读体验了。长大后，几乎很少会有。童年的时候所有事情都呈现最好的模样，然后就开始走下坡路…好吧，大概是因为愤世嫉俗，我猜。我只是想谢谢你，让我想起事物曾经的样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those are more words than Elsa has ever heard the woman say without stuttering. The woman offers her what's in the bag. Elsa takes it. It's also a book. A fairy tale. The Brothers Lionheart, by Astrid Lindgren. Elsa knows that, because it's one of her favorite stories that doesn't come from the Land-of-Almost-Awake. She read it aloud to Granny many times while they were driving around in Renault. It's about Karl and Jonatan, who die and come to Nangijala, where they have to fight the tyrant Tengil and the dragon Katla.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些话比爱莎听这女人顺畅说出的所有字还要多。女人把袋子里的东西给她。爱莎接过来。那也是一本书，一本童话故事。阿斯特丽德·林格伦的《狮心兄弟》。爱莎知道这本书，这是她最喜欢的、不是来自不眠大陆的故事之一。她和外婆开着雷诺车兜风时，她曾大声读过好几遍给外婆听。故事讲的是卡尔和约拿旦死去并来到“南极亚拉”，在那里他们必须对抗暴君腾格尔和恶龙卡特拉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Usually it's their thing, correcting one another. Their only thing. Dad has a word jar, where Elsa puts difficult words she has learned, like "concise" and "pretentious," or complex phrases like "My fridge is a taco sauce graveyard."
