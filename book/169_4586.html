<div class="line_en">I am looking for a maid of three-and-ten," she told the grey-haired goodwife beside the village well. "A highborn maid and very beautiful, with blue eyes and auburn hair. She may have been traveling with a portly knight of forty years, or perhaps with a fool. Have you seen her?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The blacksmith had not seen her either, nor the septon in the village sept, the swineherd with his pigs, the girl pulling up onions from her garden, nor any of the other simple folk that the Maid of Tarth found amongst the daub-and-wattle huts of Rosby. Still, she persisted. This is the shortest road to Duskendale, Brienne told herself. If Sansa came this way, someone must have seen her. At the castle gates she posed her question to two spearmen whose badges showed three red chevronels on ermine, the arms of House Rosby. "If she's on the roads these days she won't be no maid for long," said the older man. The younger wanted to know if the girl had that auburn hair between her legs as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁匠也没见过，乡村圣堂的修士、养猪的猪倌、菜园里拔洋葱的女孩通通都说没有见过，罗斯比村中到处是木条泥土搭成的小屋，塔斯之女在这里没有找到一丝线索。然而她坚持不肯放弃。这是到暮谷城的捷径，布蕾妮告诉自己，假如珊莎去那边寻求庇护或者坐船，一定会打这儿经过。在城堡门口，她询问两个长矛兵，他们的纹章是貂皮上三条“人”字红杠，属于罗斯比家族。“这年头，她要是在路上走动，早就不是什么处女了。”年长的那个说，年轻的则想知道，那女孩两腿间的毛发是否也是枣红色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I will find no help here. As Brienne mounted up again, she glimpsed a skinny boy atop a piebald horse at the far end of the village. I have not talked with that one, she thought, but he vanished behind the sept before she could seek him out. She did not trouble to chase after him. Most like he knew no more than the others had. Rosby was scarce more than a wide place in the road; Sansa would have had no reason to linger here. Returning to the road, Brienne headed north and east past apple orchards and fields of barley, and soon left the village and its castle well behind. It was at Duskendale that she would find her quarry, she told herself. If she came this way at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在这儿得不到帮助。布蕾妮跨上马背时，瞥到村子尽头有个瘦瘦的男孩骑在一匹花斑马上。我还没问他话，她心想，但不等过去，那男孩就消失在圣堂背后了。她没费力去追，多半他知道的也不比其他人多。罗斯比村几乎只算是大路旁的一片开阔地，珊莎没理由在此停留，于是布蕾妮重新上路，经过苹果园和大麦地向东北方前进，很快便将村子和城堡甩在了身后。到暮谷城才见分晓，她告诉自己，假设对方确实是往这个方向走的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will find the girl and keep her safe," Brienne had promised Ser Jaime, back at King's Landing. "For her lady mother's sake. And for yours." Noble words, but words were easy. Deeds were hard. She had lingered too long and learned too little in the city. I should have set out earlier… but to where? Sansa Stark had vanished on the night King Joffrey died, and if anyone had seen her since, or had any inkling where she might have gone, they were not talking. Not to me, at least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会找到那女孩，护得她周全，”在君临，布蕾妮曾答应詹姆爵士，“为了她母亲大人。也为了您。”高尚的言辞，但说起来容易，做起来难。她在城中逗留得太久，打听到的消息却少之又少。我早该动身…但天海茫茫，往哪里去找？珊莎·史塔克在乔佛里国王死去当晚便消失得无影无踪，即使后来有谁见过她，或者略微知晓她的去向，也没有说出口。至少没跟我说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even if Sansa Stark had wanted to go home, how would she get there? The kingsroad was not safe; even a child would know that. The ironborn held Moat Cailin athwart the Neck, and at the Twins sat the Freys, who had murdered Sansa's brother and lady mother. The girl could go by sea if she had the coin, but the harbor at King's Landing was still in ruins, the river a jumble of broken quays and burned and sunken galleys. Brienne had asked along the docks, but no one could remember a ship leaving on the night King Joffrey died. A few trading ships were anchoring in the bay and off-loading by boat, one man told her, but more were continuing up the coast to Duskendale, where the port was busier than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="退一步说，即使珊莎·史塔克想回家，该怎么走呢？国王大道不安全，这是小孩子都知道的常识：铁民占据了横亘颈泽的卡林湾，孪河城为佛雷家族的地盘，他们是杀害珊莎的哥哥和母亲的元凶。假如她有钱，可以走海路，但君临的港口仍是一片废墟，黑水河内杂乱无章地塞满了支离破碎的木堤和焚毁沉没的战舰。布蕾妮沿码头询问，没人记得乔佛里国王死的那天晚上有船离开。少数几条商船泊在海湾里，用小舟卸货，有个人告诉她，更多船只沿着海岸继续前进，去往暮谷城，那里的港口从来没有这么繁忙过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brienne believed the girl had left the city. If she were still in King's Landing, the gold cloaks would have turned her up. She had to have gone elsewhere… but elsewhere is a big place. If I were a maiden newly flowered, alone and afraid, in desperate danger, what would I do? she had asked herself. Where would I go? For her, the answer came easy. She would make her way back to Tarth, to her father. Sansa's father had been beheaded whilst she watched, however. Her lady mother was dead too, murdered at the Twins, and Winterfell, the great Stark stronghold, had been sacked and burned, its people put to the sword. She has no home to run to, no father, no mother, no brothers. She might be in the next town, or on a ship to Asshai; one seemed as likely as the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布蕾妮相信那女孩已离开了都城。假如她仍在君临，无疑会被金袍子们揪出来。她一定得逃…但逃去哪里就很难说了。假设我是个月经初潮的处女，孤独恐惧，又处于极度危险之中，会怎么办呢？她扪心自问。我会去哪里？对她来说，答案很简单——回塔斯找父亲。然而珊莎目睹自己的生父被斩首，母亲大人也在孪河城遭遇谋害，史塔克家的根据地临冬城已被洗劫焚毁，居民屠杀殆尽。她无家可归，没有了父亲，没有了母亲，没有了兄弟姐妹。她也许就在下一个镇子，也许在前往亚夏的船上，一切皆有可能。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Brienne's mare was sweet to look upon and kept a pretty pace. There were more travelers than she would have thought. Begging brothers trundled by with their bowls dangling on thongs about their necks. A young septon galloped past upon a palfrey as fine as any lord's, and later she met a band of silent sisters who shook their heads when Brienne put her question to them. A train of oxcarts lumbered south with grain and sacks of wool, and later she passed a swineherd driving pigs, and an old woman in a horse litter with an escort of mounted guards. She asked all of them if they had seen a highborn girl of three-and-ten years with blue eyes and auburn hair. None had. She asked about the road ahead as well. "'Twixt here and Duskendale is safe enough," one man told her, "but past Duskendale there's outlaws, and broken men in the woods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和詹姆说的不同，布蕾妮的母马外表其实不赖，并且它的确能保持相当快的步伐。旅人比她预想的多。乞丐帮的人们缓步而行，脖子上用绳索吊着碗。一个年轻修士飞驰而过，他的坐骑可以跟贵族领主的媲美。稍后，她遇到一群静默姐妹，布蕾妮开口询问，但她们全都摇头不知。一队牛车隆隆南行，满载着谷物和袋袋羊毛，后来她又经过一个赶猪群的猪倌，还有一个坐马车的老妇人，由一队骑马的卫兵护卫。她也向他们提问，是否看到一个十三岁的贵族处女，蓝眼睛，枣红色头发。没人看见。她又问了前方的路况。“从这到暮谷城还算安全，”有人告诉她，“但过了暮谷城，林子里就是土匪和残人的天下了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only the soldier pines and sentinels still showed green; the broadleaf trees had donned mantles of russet and gold, or else uncloaked themselves to scratch against the sky with branches brown and bare. Every gust of wind drove swirling clouds of dead leaves across the rutted road. They made a rustling sound as they scuttled past the hooves of the big bay mare that Jaime Lannister had bestowed on her. As easy to find one leaf in the wind as one girl lost in Westeros. She found herself wondering whether Jaime had given her this task as some cruel jape. Perhaps Sansa Stark was dead, beheaded for her part in King Joffrey's death, buried in some unmarked grave. How better to conceal her murder than by sending some big stupid wench from Tarth to find her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="郊外的士卒松和哨兵树仍有绿意，阔叶树则已披上褐色与金色的斗篷，甚或脱去了长袍，裸露的褐色枝干像爪子一样伸向天空。每当有风吹过，压满车辙的路面上便激荡起无数盘旋的枯叶。枯叶沙沙地从马蹄底下掠过，这匹大母马是詹姆·兰尼斯特赠予她的。在维斯特洛大地上寻找一个失踪的女孩，犹如在秋风中寻找一片落叶。她不由得怀疑，詹姆给她的任务是不是一个残酷的玩笑。也许珊莎已因与乔佛里国王之死有染而被悄悄处死，埋在某个无名墓地，然后再派塔斯的大块头蠢女人去找她，还有什么更好的方法来掩盖谋杀呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near dusk she saw a campfire burning by a brook. Two men sat beside it grilling trout, their arms and armor stacked beneath a tree. One was old and one was somewhat younger, though far from young. The younger rose to greet her. He had a big belly straining at the laces of his spotted doeskin jerkin. A shaggy untrimmed beard covered his cheeks and chin, the color of old gold. "We have trout enough for three, ser," he called out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黄昏时分，她看到一条小溪边上燃着篝火。两个人坐在火堆边烤鲑鱼，他们的武器防具堆在一棵树下。其中一个是老人，另一个没那么老，但也不算年轻。相对年轻的那个站起来跟她打招呼。他穿一件斑斑点点的鹿皮上衣，系带紧紧绷在大肚子上，乱蓬蓬未加修整的胡子覆盖了脸颊和下巴，颜色犹如陈旧的黄金。“我们的鲑鱼足够三个人吃，爵士。”他大喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jaime would not do that. He was sincere. He gave me the sword, and called it Oathkeeper. Anyway, it made no matter. She had promised Lady Catelyn that she would bring back her daughters, and no promise was as solemn as one sworn to the dead. The younger girl was long dead, Jaime claimed; the Arya the Lannisters sent north to marry Roose Bolton's bastard was a fraud. That left only Sansa. Brienne had to find her.</div>

She was broad in the shoulder and broader in the hips. Her legs were long, her arms thick. Her chest was more muscle than bosom. Her hands were big, her feet enormous. And she was ugly besides, with a freckled, horsey face and teeth that seemed almost too big for her mouth. She did not need to be reminded of any of that. "Sers," she said, "have you seen a maid of three-andten upon the road? She has blue eyes and auburn hair, and may have been in company with a portly red-faced man of forty years."</div>

<div class="line_en">If there was a song about Creighton Longbough, it was not one Brienne had heard. Their names meant no more to her than did their arms. Ser Creighton's green shield showed only a brown chief, and a deep gouge made by some battle-axe. Ser Illifer bore gold and ermine gyronny, though everything about him suggested that painted gold and painted ermine were the only sorts he'd ever known. He was sixty if he was a day, his face pinched and narrow beneath the hood of a patched roughspun mantle. Mail-clad he went, but flecks of rust spotted the iron like freckles. Brienne stood a head taller than either of them, and was better mounted and better armed in the bargain. If I fear the likes of these, I had as well swap my longsword for a pair of knitting needles.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cold in the earth seeped through Brienne's blankets to soak into her bones. Before long every muscle felt clenched and cramped, from her jaw down to her toes. She wondered whether Sansa Stark was cold as well, wherever she might be. Lady Catelyn had said that Sansa was a gentle soul who loved lemon cakes, silken gowns, and songs of chivalry, yet the girl had seen her father's head lopped off and been forced to marry one of his killers afterward. If half the tales were true, the dwarf was the cruelest Lannister of all. If she did poison King Joffrey, the Imp surely forced her hand. She was alone and friendless at that court. In King's Landing, Brienne had hunted down a certain Brella, who had been one of Sansa's maids. The woman told her that there was little warmth between Sansa and the dwarf. Perhaps she had been fleeing him as well as Joffrey's murder.</div>

The hedge knights were up and about. Ser Illifer was cutting up a squirrel for breakfast, while Ser Creighton stood facing a tree, having himself a good long piss.

<div class="line_en">Three hours later they came up upon another party struggling toward Duskendale; a merchant and his serving men, accompanied by yet another hedge knight. The merchant rode a dappled grey mare, whilst his servants took turns pulling his wagon. Four labored in the traces as the other two walked beside the wheels, but when they heard the sound of horses they formed up around the wagon with quarterstaffs of ash at the ready. The merchant produced a crossbow, the knight a blade. "You will forgive me if I am suspicious," called the merchant, "but the times are troubled, and I have only good Ser Shadrich to defend me. Who are you?"</div>

Her scabbard was a plain thing, wood wrapped in cracked brown leather, and her sword was plainer still. She had bought it in King's Landing, to replace the blade the Brave Companions had stolen. Renly's sword. It still hurt, knowing she had lost it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，大厅里的嘈杂变得难以忍受，她含含糊糊地道过晚安，上楼睡觉去了。房间的天花板很低，布蕾妮手持细烛走进去时，不得不弯腰，否则会撞到脑袋。屋内唯一的摆设是一张足够睡六人的大床，还有窗台上的一段牛油蜡烛头。她用细蜡烛把它点燃，闩上门，又将剑带挂到床柱子上。她的木剑鞘朴素简易，包裹在开裂的棕色皮革之中，而她的剑更加平凡。这是她在君临买的，以代替被勇士团夺走的那把。那是蓝礼的配剑。想到自己把它弄丢了，她仍然感觉很难过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kneeling between the bed and wall, she held the blade and said a silent prayer to the Crone, whose golden lamp showed men the way through life. Lead me, she prayed, light the way before me, show me the path that leads to Sansa. She had failed Renly, had failed Lady Catelyn. She must not fail Jaime. He trusted me with his sword. He trusted me with his honor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她跪在床和墙壁之间，举剑向老妪默默祈祷，祈求老妪的金灯能指引她一条明路。指引我，她祷告，照亮我前方的道路，指引我寻找珊莎。她已经辜负了蓝礼，辜负了凯特琳夫人。她不能再辜负詹姆。他把自己的剑托付给我，也把自己的荣誉托付给了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she had another longsword hidden in her bedroll. She sat on the bed and took it out. Gold glimmered yellow in the candlelight and rubies smoldered red. When she slid Oathkeeper from the ornate scabbard, Brienne's breath caught in her throat. Black and red the ripples ran, deep within the steel. Valyrian steel, spell-forged. It was a sword fit for a hero. When she was small, her nurse had filled her ears with tales of valor, regaling her with the noble exploits of Ser Galladon of Morne, Florian the Fool, Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, and other champions. Each man bore a famous sword, and surely Oathkeeper belonged in their company, even if she herself did not. "You'll be defending Ned Stark's daughter with Ned Stark's own steel," Jaime had promised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她的铺盖卷里还藏着另一把长剑。她坐到床上，将它取出来。烛焰之下，镀金闪耀着黄光，红宝石仿佛闷烧的火。布蕾妮将守誓剑拔出华丽的剑鞘，不由得屏住呼吸。血红与漆黑的波纹深深地嵌入了钢铁之中。这是瓦雷利亚钢剑，由魔法形塑而成。这是一把英雄的配剑。小时候，奶妈向她灌输了许多英雄故事，让她知道“晨光”加勒敦爵士、傻子佛罗理安、龙骑士伊蒙王子以及其他勇士们的伟大事迹。他们每人都有一把名剑，守誓剑也该如此，但她自己并非英雄。“你将用奈德·史塔克自己的剑来保护他的女儿。”詹姆曾经允诺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her candle burned out. Darkness settled over the Old Stone Bridge, and the inn grew so still that she could hear the murmur of the river. Only then did Brienne rise to gather up her things. She eased the door open, listened, made her way barefoot down the steps. Outside she donned her boots and hurried to the stables to saddle her bay mare, asking a silent pardon of Ser Creighton and Ser Illifer as she mounted. One of Hibald's serving men woke when she rode past him, but made no move to stop her. Her mare's hooves rang upon the old stone bridge. Then the trees closed in around her, black as pitch and full of ghosts and memories. I am coming for you, Lady Sansa, she thought as she rode into the darkness. Be not afraid. I shall not rest until I've found you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蜡烛已尽，黑暗笼罩着老石桥，周围变得如此宁谧，她甚至可以听见河流低沉的汩汩声。布蕾妮这才起来收拾东西。她轻轻推开门，听了听动静，然后光脚走下楼梯。她在外面套上靴子，快步来到马厩里，给她的母马系上鞍配。她一边跨上马背，一边默默地向克雷顿爵士和伊利佛爵士致歉。骑马经过亥巴德的一个仆人时，他醒了过来，但没有阻止她。母马的铁蹄在古老的石桥上发出清脆的响声，接着，树林将她包围，黑如沥青，充满了鬼魂和记忆。我来了，珊莎小姐，她一边想一边飞驰入黑暗之中。勿需害怕。不把你找到，我决不罢休。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Afterward she stretched out on the bed as best she could. For all its width it was not long enough, so Brienne lay across it sideways. She could hear the clatter of tankards from below, and voices drifting up the steps. The fleas that Longbough had spoken of put in their appearance. Scratching helped keep her awake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，她在床上尽量伸展开身子。床很宽，但不够长，布蕾妮只能侧过来睡。她可以听到下面杯盏交碰的声音，话语声沿着楼梯飘上来。朗勃提到的虱子现身了。抓挠有助于她保持清醒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She heard Hibald mount the stairs, and sometime later the knights as well. "… I never knew his name," Ser Creighton was saying as he went by, "but upon his shield he bore a blood-red chicken, and his blade was dripping gore…" His voice faded, and somewhere up above, a door opened and closed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她听见亥巴德走上楼梯，稍后，骑士们也上来了。“…我一直不知道他的名字，”克雷顿爵士经过时在说，“但他盾牌上有一只血红的鸡，而他的剑上滴着血…”他的话音渐渐消失，楼上的一扇门打开又阖上。">查看中文翻译</div>
