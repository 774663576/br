<div class="line_en">When Pierre Gringoire arrived on the Place de Grève, he was paralyzed. He had directed his course across the Pont aux Meuniers, in order to avoid the rabble on the Pont au Change, and the pennons of Jehan Fourbault; but the wheels of all the bishop's mills had splashed him as he passed, and his doublet was drenched; it seemed to him besides, that the failure of his piece had rendered him still more sensible to cold than usual. Hence he made haste to draw near the bonfire, which was burning magnificently in the middle of the Place. But a considerable crowd formed a circle around it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Accursed Parisians!" he said to himself (for Gringoire, like a true dramatic poet, was subject to monologues) "there they are obstructing my fire! Nevertheless, I am greatly in need of a chimney corner; my shoes drink in the water, and all those cursed mills wept upon me! That devil of a Bishop of Paris, with his mills! I'd just like to know what use a bishop can make of a mill! Does he expect to become a miller instead of a bishop? If only my malediction is needed for that, I bestow it upon him! and his cathedral, and his mills! Just see if those boobies will put themselves out! Move aside! I'd like to know what they are doing there! They are warming themselves, much pleasure may it give them! They are watching a hundred fagots burn; a fine spectacle!"</div>

<div class="line_en">On looking more closely, he perceived that the circle was much larger than was required simply for the purpose of getting warm at the king's fire, and that this concourse of people had not been attracted solely by the beauty of the hundred fagots which were burning.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was not tall, though she seemed so, so boldly did her slender form dart about. She was swarthy of complexion, but one divined that, by day, her skin must possess that beautiful golden tone of the Andalusians and the Roman women. Her little foot, too, was Andalusian, for it was both pinched and at ease in its graceful shoe. She danced, she turned, she whirled rapidly about on an old Persian rug, spread negligently under her feet; and each time that her radiant face passed before you, as she whirled, her great black eyes darted a flash of lightning at you.</div>

<div class="line_en">All around her, all glances were riveted, all mouths open; and, in fact, when she danced thus, to the humming of the Basque tambourine, which her two pure, rounded arms raised above her head, slender, frail and vivacious as a wasp, with her corsage of gold without a fold, her variegated gown puffing out, her bare shoulders, her delicate limbs, which her petticoat revealed at times, her black hair, her eyes of flame, she was a supernatural creature.</div>

<div class="line_en">She began her dance once more; she took from the ground two swords, whose points she rested against her brow, and which she made to turn in one direction, while she turned in the other; it was a purely gypsy effect. But, disenchanted though Gringoire was, the whole effect of this picture was not without its charm and its magic; the bonfire illuminated, with a red flaring light, which trembled, all alive, over the circle of faces in the crowd, on the brow of the young girl, and at the background of the Place cast a pallid reflection, on one side upon the ancient, black, and wrinkled façade of the House of Pillars, on the other, upon the old stone gibbet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Among the thousands of visages which that light tinged with scarlet, there was one which seemed, even more than all the others, absorbed in contemplation of the dancer. It was the face of a man, austere, calm, and sombre. This man, whose costume was concealed by the crowd which surrounded him, did not appear to be more than five and thirty years of age; nevertheless, he was bald; he had merely a few tufts of thin, gray hair on his temples; his broad, high forehead had begun to be furrowed with wrinkles, but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary youthfulness, an ardent life, a profound passion. He kept them fixed incessantly on the gypsy, and, while the giddy young girl of sixteen danced and whirled, for the pleasure of all, his revery seemed to become more and more sombre. From time to time, a smile and a sigh met upon his lips, but the smile was more melancholy than the sigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在千百张为火光照映得通红的脸中间，有一张似乎比其他在观赏跳舞的姑娘的人更为出神。这是一个严峻、沉着、阴郁的男人的脸。他穿着什么衣服，因为周围的人群挡着，看不出来；岁数至多三十五，可是已经秃顶了：只见两边太阳穴边上才稀稀拉拉地有几撮头发，而且已经花白了；高高的宽大额头开始刻画着一道道皱纹；但是，在他那深凹的眼睛里闪烁着不寻常的青春火花、火热的活力、深沉的欲情。他目不转睛地盯着吉卜赛女郎。这里，这十六岁的佻薄少女舞着，飞旋着，大家都很高兴；他那里沉思默想却越来越阴沉了。不时，他嘴唇上浮现出微笑，同时发出一声叹息，然而，笑容比叹息更为痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Gringoire saw come up to her, a pretty little white goat, alert, wide-awake, glossy, with gilded horns, gilded hoofs, and gilded collar, which he had not hitherto perceived, and which had remained lying curled up on one corner of the carpet watching his mistress dance.</div>

There remained not so much as a miserable camichon at five sous the pound. Nothing remained upon the wall but slender fleurs-de-lis, mingled with rose bushes, painted in 1434 by Mathieu Biterne.

No supper, no shelter; he saw himself pressed on all sides by necessity, and he found necessity very crabbed. He had long ago discovered the truth, that Jupiter created men during a fit of misanthropy, and that during a wise man's whole life, his destiny holds his philosophy in a state of siege. As for himself, he had never seen the blockade so complete; he heard his stomach sounding a parley, and he considered it very much out of place that evil destiny should capture his philosophy by famine.</div>

There were continual outbursts, melodies, unexpected cadences, then simple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes; then floods of scales which would have put a nightingale to rout, but in which harmony was always present; then soft modulations of octaves which rose and fell, like the bosom of the young singer.

And the old invisible kill-joy might have had occasion to repent of her aggressions against the gypsy had their attention not been diverted at this moment by the procession of the Pope of the Fools, which, after having traversed many streets and squares, debouched on the Place de Grève, with all its torches and all its uproar.</div>

<div class="line_en">First came Egypt. The Duke of Egypt headed it, on horseback, with his counts on foot holding his bridle and stirrups for him; behind them, the male and female Egyptians, pell-mell, with their little children crying on their shoulders; all -- duke, counts, and populace -- in rags and tatters. Then came the Kingdom of Argot; that is to say, all the thieves of France, arranged according to the order of their dignity; the minor people walking first. Thus defiled by fours, with the divers insignia of their grades, in that strange faculty, most of them lame, some cripples, others one-armed, shop clerks, pilgrim, hubins, bootblacks, thimble-riggers, street arabs, beggars, the blear-eyed beggars, thieves, the weakly, vagabonds, merchants, sham soldiers, goldsmiths, passed masters of pickpockets, isolated thieves. A catalogue that would weary Homer. In the centre of the conclave of the passed masters of pickpockets, one had some difficulty in distinguishing the King of Argot, the grand coësre, so called, crouching in a little cart drawn by two big dogs. After the kingdom of the Argotiers, came the Empire of Galilee. Guillaume Rousseau, Emperor of the Empire of Galilee, marched majestically in his robe of purple, spotted with wine, preceded by buffoons wrestling and executing military dances; surrounded by his macebearers, his pickpockets and clerks of the chamber of accounts. Last of all came the corporation of law clerks, with its maypoles crowned with flowers, its black robes, its music worthy of the orgy, and its large candles of yellow wax. In the centre of this crowd, the grand officers of the Brotherhood of Fools bore on their shoulders a litter more loaded down with candles than the reliquary of Sainte-Geneviève in time of pest; and on this litter shone resplendent, with crosier, cope, and mitre, the new Pope of the Fools, the bellringer of Notre-Dame, Quasimodo the hunchback.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最前列是埃及（27）。埃及公爵骑马领队，他那些伯爵在下面步行，给他牵缰执镫；后面乱七八糟走着埃及男女，肩扛怀抱着哭哭啼啼的小儿；他们这一群，公爵殿下和众位伯爵，还有百姓细民，一概破衣烂衫，衣不蔽体。然后是江湖乞丐们（28），就是说，法国的各类盗贼，依照品级的低高排列：最次的位置最先。就这样，四个人一排，带着他们在这个奇特体中各等级的各式各样标记，行进着，大多数是残疾，缺胳臂的，少腿的，有那矮而肥的，又有那假香客，还有夜盲的，疯癫的，对眼的，卖假药的，放荡的，可鄙的，胆小的，病弱的，卖劣货的，狡猾的，没娘老子的，喜欢帮凶的，假冒为善的，即使荷马复生也不能尽举。在假冒为善者和喜欢帮凶者组成的核心圈子的中央，好不容易才识别得出乞丐王——龙头大哥。只见他蹲在两头大狗拉的一辆小车里。在江湖好汉后面来到了伽利略帝国（29）。伽利略帝国的皇帝吉约墨·卢梭，身穿葡萄酒迹斑斑点点的朱红袍，威严赫赫地走着，前导是相扑着的武技舞蹈者，周围是皇帝的执杖吏、帮闲和审计院小书记们。最后来的是司法宫小书记们，身穿黑袍，推着一株株纸花鲜艳的五月树，奏着可以在群魔会上演奏的音乐，燃着黄色大蜡烛。浩浩荡荡的队伍的中心是丑人团大骑士们肩扛舁子，上面点的小蜡烛数量之多为瘟疫流行时圣日内维埃芙圣物盒担架所不及。在这顶舁舆上，顶冠执杖，身披王袍，灿烂辉煌端坐着新登基的丑人王——圣母院敲钟人、驼子卡席莫多。【注：（27）指吉卜赛人社会。公爵、伯爵是圈子里的人给予大小头目的称呼。（28）原文作“黑话王国”。指除吉卜赛人以外的流浪汉、盗贼等等，而主体是乞丐。（29）“伽利略帝国”本是中世纪对审计院的称呼，这里是江湖切口，指的是卖艺人社会。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is difficult to convey an idea of the degree of proud and blissful expansion to which the sad and hideous visage of Quasimodo had attained during the transit from the Palais de Justice, to the Place de Grève. It was the first enjoyment of self-love that he had ever experienced. Down to that day, he had known only humiliation, disdain for his condition, disgust for his person. Hence, deaf though he was, he enjoyed, like a veritable pope, the acclamations of that throng, which he hated because he felt that he was hated by it. What mattered it that his people consisted of a pack of fools, cripples, thieves, and beggars? it was still a people and he was its sovereign. And he accepted seriously all this ironical applause, all this derisive respect, with which the crowd mingled, it must be admitted, a good deal of very real fear. For the hunchback was robust; for the bandy-legged fellow was agile; for the deaf man was malicious: three qualities which temper ridicule.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自打司法宫出发，来到河滩，卡席莫多那哀伤而丑陋的面容，是怎样逐渐达至傲然焕发的幸福顶点，真是难以尽述。这是他生平第一次自尊心得到满足。在此以前，他只体验过由于自身地位低贱而遭到屈辱和轻侮，由于形象丑陋而遭受唾弃。因此，他虽然是个聋子，也俨若货真价实的教皇（32），他一向感觉到被群众憎恶因而自己也仇恨他们，这时却享受着他们的欢呼。纵然他的子民是一堆丑人、瘫子、盗贼、乞丐，那又有什么！反正是他的子民，而他是他们的君王。对于这种种讥诮的鼓掌、可笑的尊敬，他仍然看得顶真，不过，也得承认，这里面也混杂着群众对他确实有点畏惧，因为，驼子力大无穷，瘸子行走如风，聋子诡计多端：这三种特质冲淡了荒唐可笑的成份。【注：（32）即丑人王。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Each section of this grotesque procession had its own music. The Egyptians made their drums and African tambourines resound. The slang men, not a very musical race, still clung to the goat's horn trumpet and the Gothic rubebbe of the twelfth century. The Empire of Galilee was not much more advanced; among its music one could hardly distinguish some miserable rebec, from the infancy of the art, still imprisoned in the re-la-mi. But it was around the Pope of the Fools that all the musical riches of the epoch were displayed in a magnificent discord. It was nothing but soprano rebecs, counter-tenor rebecs, and tenor rebecs, not to reckon the flutes and brass instruments. Alas! our readers will remember that this was Gringoire's orchestra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这支古怪的游行队伍每一部分都有自己的独特音乐。埃及人轰然敲击非洲木柝和手鼓。不谙音律的黑话分子也拉起弦琴（30），吹起号角，弹起十一二世纪的峨特手琴（31）。伽利略帝国也不见得先进，他们那种音乐中依稀可辨艺术原始时代某种窳劣三弦提琴的尚滞留于ré—la—mi的乐音。不过，集当时音乐富丽之大成，互相倾轧，不亦乐乎，奏得好不热闹的还是在丑人王的周围：这些乐器是最高音三弦提琴、次最高音三弦提琴、高音三弦提琴，外加笛子和铜管乐器。可叹呀！——我们的读者还记得，这些正是格兰古瓦的乐队。【注：（30）即古式小提琴。（31）一种四弦弹拨乐器。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We are far from believing, however, that the new Pope of the Fools understood both the sentiments which he felt and the sentiments which he inspired. The spirit which was lodged in this failure of a body had, necessarily, something incomplete and deaf about it. Thus, what he felt at the moment was to him, absolutely vague, indistinct, and confused. Only joy made itself felt, only pride dominated. Around that sombre and unhappy face, there hung a radiance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，新丑人王居然有能力理解自己此刻的感情，也理解别人此刻的感情，这却是我们万万想不到的。这个未成人形的躯壳里寓居的灵魂，必然有未臻完善、相当闭塞之处，所以，即使有感受，他此刻的感受，对于他自己，也一定是极其模糊、含混、紊乱的。只是，欢喜浸透着他，自豪主宰着他，他那阴沉而不幸的脸庞也就容光焕发了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was, then, not without surprise and alarm, that at the very moment when Quasimodo was passing the Pillar House, in that semi-intoxicated state, a man was seen to dart from the crowd, and to tear from his hands, with a gesture of anger, his crosier of gilded wood, the emblem of his mock popeship.</div>
