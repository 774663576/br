<div class="line_en">He came in griping about how cold it was out. Then he said, "Where the hell is everybody? It's like a goddam morgue around here." I didn't even bother to answer him. If he was so goddam stupid not to realize it was Saturday night and everybody was out or asleep or home for the week end, I wasn't going to break my neck telling him. He started getting undressed. He didn't say one goddam word about Jane. Not one. Neither did I. I just watched him. All he did was thank me for letting him wear my hound's-tooth. He hung it up on a hanger and put it in the closet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some things are hard to remember. I'm thinking now of when Stradlater got back from his date with Jane. I mean I can't remember exactly what I was doing when I heard his goddam stupid footsteps coming down the corridor. I probably was still looking out the window, but I swear I can't remember. I was so damn worried, that's why. When I really worry about something, I don't just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something. Only, I don't go. I'm too worried to go. I don't want to interrupt my worrying to go. If you knew Stradlater, you'd have been worried, too. I'd double-dated with that bastard a couple of times, and I know what I'm talking about. He was unscrupulous. He really was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有的事情很难回忆。我现在正在回想斯特拉德莱塔跟琴约会后回来时候的情景。我是说我怎么也记不起我听到他混帐的脚步声从走廊传来时我到底在干什么。我大概还在往窗外眺望，可我发誓说我怎么也记不起来了。原因是，我当时心里烦得要命。我要是为什么事心里真正烦起来，就不再胡闹。我心里一烦，甚至都得上厕所。只是我不肯动窝儿，我烦得甚至都不想动，我不愿随便动窝儿打断自己的烦恼。要是你认识斯特拉德莱塔，你也一准会心烦。我曾跟那杂种一块儿约会过女朋友，我知道我自己说的什么。他这人不知廉耻。他真是这样的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then when he was taking off his tie, he asked me if I'd written his goddam composition for him. I told him it was over on his goddam bed.

He was always stroking his stomach or his chest. He was mad about himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't even answer him. I just threw the pieces in the wastebasket. Then I lay down on my bed, and we both didn't say anything for a long time. He got all undressed, down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren't allowed to smoke in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and nobody could smell the smoke. Besides, I did it to annoy Stradlater. It drove him crazy when you broke any rules. He never smoked in the dorm. It was only me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我甚至都没回答他。我只是把碎纸扔进字纸篓，回到自己的床上躺下，有好长时间我们两人谁都没说话。他把衣服全脱了，只剩下裤衩，我呢，就歪在床上点了支烟。宿舍里本来不准吸烟，可等到夜深人静，大伙儿有的睡觉有的外出，没人闻得到烟味的时候，你可以偷着吸。再说，我这样做也是故意跟斯特拉德莱塔捣蛋。他只要见人不守校规，就会气得发疯。他自己从来不在宿舍里吸烟。只有我一个人吸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't even bother to get up. I just lay there on the floor for a while, and kept calling him a moron sonuvabitch. I was so mad, I was practically bawling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我甚至不打算站起来，就那么在地板上躺了一会儿，不住口地骂他是婊子养的窝囊废。我都气疯了，简直在破口大骂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told him to go wash his own moron face -- which was a pretty childish thing to say, but I was mad as hell. I told him to stop off on the way to the can and give Mrs. Schmidt the time. Mrs. Schmidt was the janitor's wife. She was around sixty-five.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我叫他去洗他自己的窝囊脸――这话当然很孩子气，可我确实气疯了。我叫他到盥洗室去的半路上最好顺便拐个弯，跟席密德太太干那事去。席密德太太是看门人的妻子，大约六十五岁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I kept sitting there on the floor till I heard old Stradlater close the door and go down the corridor to the can. Then I got up. I couldn't find my goddam hunting hat anywhere. Finally I found it. It was under the bed. I put it on, and turned the old peak around to the back, the way I liked it, and then I went over and took a look at my stupid face in the mirror. You never saw such gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bathrobe. It partly scared me and it partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough. I'd only been in about two fights in my life, and I lost both of them. I'm not too tough. I'm a pacifist, if you want to know the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在地板上不动，直到听见老斯特拉德莱塔关上门，沿着走廊向盥洗室走去，我才站起来。我哪儿也找不到我那顶混帐猎人帽了。最后才在床底下找到。我戴上帽子，把鸭舌转到脑后，我就喜欢这么戴，然后过去照镜子，瞧瞧我自己的笨脸蛋。你这一辈子再也没见过那样的血污。我的嘴上、腮帮上甚至睡衣上和浴衣上全都是血。我有点儿害怕，也有点儿神往。这一片血污倒让我看上去很象个好汉。我这一辈子只打过两次架，两次我都打输了。我算不了好汉。我是个和平主义者，我老实跟你说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had a feeling old Ackley'd probably heard all the racket and was awake. So I went through the shower curtains into his room, just to see what the hell he was doing. I hardly ever went over to his room. It always had a funny stink in it, because he was so crumby in his personal habits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我依稀觉得老阿克莱听见我们争吵，这时正醒着。所以我掀开淋浴室门帘走进他的房间，看看他在做什么。我很少进他的房间。他的房内老是有一股奇怪的臭气，因为他这个人的私生活实在邋遢极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
