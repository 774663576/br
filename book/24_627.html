<div class="line_en">This was another of those restless nights when his brain went on turning like a machine whose governor had failed. He knew better than to woo sleep any further, and reluctantly climbed out of bed. Throwing on his dressing-gown, he strolled out on to the roof garden of his modest flat. There was not one of his direct subordinates who did not possess much more luxurious quarters, but this place was ample for Stormgren's needs. He had reached the position where neither personal possessions nor official ceremony could add anything to his stature.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stormgren was sleeping badly these nights, which was strange, since soon he would be putting aside the cares of office forever. He had served mankind for forty years, and its masters for five, and few men could look back upon a life that had seen so many of its ambitions achieved. Perhaps that was the trouble; in the years of retirement, however many they might be, he would have no further goals to give any zest to life. Since Martha had died and the children had established their own families, his ties with the world seemed to have weakened. It might be, too, that he was beginning to identify himself with the Overlords, and thus become detached from humanity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一想到自己即将退休，斯妥格恩几天来一直无法睡个安稳觉。为人们工作了四十年，为那些外星人统治者又干了五年，回首往事，很少有人能成就自己这么多大事，但问题也出在这里，退休之后，自己将失去下一步的人生目标，生活从此将不再精彩。玛莎死了，孩子们也成家立业了，自己同世界的联系也变少了，也许自己已经把自己看成了那些外星人的同类，反而和人类疏远了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The night was warm, almost oppressive, but the sky was clear and a brilliant moon hung low in the south-west. Ten kilometres away, the lights of New York glowed on the skyline like a dawn frozen in the act of breaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜里很暖和，甚至还有些闷热，晴朗的夜空中，一轮明月低低地挂在西南边，十公里之外的地平线上，纽约的灯火犹如黎明的晨曦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormgren raised his eyes above the sleeping city, climbing again the heights that he alone of living men had scaled. Far away though it was, he could see the hull of Karellen's ship glinting in the moonlight. He wondered what the Supervisor was doing, for he did not believe that the Overlords ever slept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩抬起头，仰望着只有自己才到过的高空。尽管距离遥远，但卡瑞林那艘飞船在月光下发出的微光仍然依稀可见。卡瑞林现在在做什么呢？那些外星人可是不睡觉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">High above, a meteor thrust its shining spear through the dome of the sky. The luminous trail glowed faintly for a while; then it died away, leaving only the stars. The reminder was brutal; in a hundred years, Karellen would still be leading mankind towards the goal that he alone could see, but four months from now another man would be Secretary-General. That in itself Stormgren was far from minding -- but it meant that little time was left if he ever hoped to learn what lay behind that thickened screen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，一颗流星划过天穹，像一支闪亮的长矛，长长的尾巴在夜空中闪烁了片刻，消失了，只剩下满天星光。未来的日子未免太残酷了：在将来的一百年里，卡瑞林将带领人类朝着那个只有他自己才看得见的目标前进；而在最近的四个月里，世界上将出现一位新的秘书长。尽管他对这个职位本身并不在意，但是退休意味着他能用来发现那个大屏幕后面的秘密的时间不多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though it was much the largest, the Freedom League was only one of the organizations that opposed Karellen -- and, consequently, the humans who cooperated with the Overlords. The objections and policies of these groups varied enormously; some took the religious viewpoint, while others were merely expressing a sense of inferiority. They felt, with good reason, much as a cultured Indian of the nineteenth century must have done as he contemplated the British Raj. The invaders had brought peace and prosperity to Earth -- but who knew what the cost might be? History was not reassuring; even the most peaceable of contacts between races at very different cultural levels had often resulted in the obliteration of the more backward society. Nations, as well as individuals, could lose their spirit when confronted by a challenge which they could not meet. And the civilization of the Overlords, veiled in mystery though it might be, was the greatest challenge Man had ever faced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一些组织反对卡瑞林，自然也反对跟他合作的人，自由团就是其中最大的一个。这些组织反对的目标和采取的政策大相径庭，有的站在宗教的角度，有的只是反对那种低人一等的感受。后者对外星人的态度类似十九世纪时一个有教养的印度人对英国政权的态度。外星人是给地球带来了和平与繁荣，但会索取什么样的代价呢？历史证明，两个处在不同文明发展程度上的国家，就算签订的协议是最友好的，结果终究是落后群体被毁灭。无论是国家还是个人，在面对一个无法接受的挑战时，都很可能丧失信心，而现在，这个笼罩在神秘迷雾中的外星文明就是人类面临的最大挑战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only in the last few days had he dared to admit that the Overlords' secretiveness was beginning to obsess him. Until recently, his faith in Karellen had kept him free from doubts; but now, he thought a little wryly, the protests of the Freedom League were beginning to have their effect upon him. It was true that the propaganda about Man's enslavement was no more than propaganda. Few people seriously believed it, or really wished for a return to the old days. Men had grown accustomed to Karellen's imperceptible rule, but they were becoming impatient to know who ruled them. And how could they be blamed?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到最近几天，他才敢承认那些外星人的神秘感也在折磨着自己。以前，一直信任卡瑞林，还觉得没什么可怀疑的；而现在呢？自由团的那些抗议活动已经开始影响自己了，他们提出的外星人奴化人类的宣传并不只是个简单的宣传，也有一定的道理，只是很少有人真正相信，也没有人真正愿意回到过去的岁月。人们已经习惯了卡瑞林润物无声的统治，他们只想知道自己的统治者到底是谁，为此他们等的不耐烦了，这又怎么能去责怪他们呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a faint click from the facsimile machine in the adjoining room as it ejected the hourly, summary sent out by Central News. Stormgren wandered indoors and ruffled halfheartedly through the sheets. On the other side of the world, the Freedom League had inspired a not-very-original headline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔壁房里传来传真机启动的微弱声响，中央新闻传来了每小时一次的报道。斯妥格恩走过去，翻看那些报纸。在东半球，自由团又推出了一个不太新颖的标题——《统治人类的是一群怪兽？》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormgren threw down the sheet in disgust. Even if the charge were true, did it really matter? The idea was an old one, but it had never worried him. He did not believe that there was any biological form, however strange, which he could not accept in time and, perhaps, even find beautiful. The mind, not the body, was all that mattered. If only he could convince Karellen of this, the Overlords might change their policy. It was certain that they could not be half as hideous as the imaginative drawings that had filled the papers soon after their coming to Earth!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩厌烦地扔下那份报道。就算他们说的全是真的，又能怎样？这种说法也不是头一次看到了，却从来没有让自己这样烦过。不管那些外星人是一种什么样的生命形态，自己都能接受，甚至还可能认为他们很美丽；最重要的不是外表，是智慧。如果能说服卡瑞林相信这一点，他肯定会改变政策。从他们来到地球上的那天起，人们凭想象画了许许多多的画像，而真正的外星人不可能比画像中的样子更吓人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"IS MAN RULED BY MONSTERS?" asked the paper, and went on to quote; "Addressing a meeting in Madras today, Dr. C. V. Krishnan, President of the Eastern Division of the Freedom League, said; 'The explanation of the Overlords' behaviour is quiet simple; Their physical form is so alien and repulsive that they dare not show themselves to humanity. I challenge the Supervisor to deny this.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet it was not, Stormgren knew, entirely consideration for his successor that made him anxious to see the end of this state of affairs. He was honest enough to admit that, in the final analysis, his, main motive was simple human curiosity. He had grown to know Karellen as a person, and he would never be satisfied until he had also discovered what kind of creature he might be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，让斯妥格恩烦恼的不完全是考虑秘书长候选人的事，还有，正如他自己最后坦然承认的那样，纯粹的好奇心。他一直把卡瑞林当成人类的一员，只有亲眼看到真实面目，自己才会满意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Stormgren failed to arrive at his usual time next morning, Pieter Van Ryberg was surprised and a little annoyed. Though the Secretary-General often made a number of calls before reaching his own office, he invariably left word that he was doing so. This morning, to make matters worse, there had been several urgent messages for Stormgren. Van Ryberg rang half a dozen departments trying to locate him, then gave it up in disgust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，斯妥格恩没有准时上班，瑞伯格感到奇怪，也有些不快：秘书长到办公室之前，通常要打很多电话，但都会通知自己的，更糟糕的是今天还有好几件重要事情等着汇报，给六大部门都去了电话，还是没找到，最后只得放弃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By noon he had become alarmed and sent a car to Stormgren's house. Ten minutes later he was startled by the scream of a siren, and a police patrol came racing up Roosevelt Drive. The news agencies must have had friends in that vehicle, for even as Van Ryberg watched it approach, the radio was telling the world that he was no longer merely Assistant, but Acting-Secretary-General of the United Nations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了中午时分，瑞伯格觉得情况不妙，忙派了辆车到斯妥格恩的住所去看个究竟。十分钟后，他听到一阵警笛声，一辆警车往罗斯福大道疾驰而来。肯定某些记者在那辆车上有朋友，因为正在他看警车驶来的片刻，收音机已经在向全世界宣布，他不再是秘书长助手，而是联合国的代理秘书长。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Along the frontiers that would soon be gone forever the guards had been doubled, but the soldiers eyed each other with a still inarticulate friendliness. The politicians and the generals might storm and rave, but the silently waiting millions felt that, none too soon, a long and bloody chapter of history was coming to an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国界上驻扎的士兵翻了一倍，但边境很快就要消失了，友谊在双方士兵的眼神中传递。政客、将军们对这样的局面勃然大怒，数以百万的民众相信，不久的将来，记录着漫长血腥历史的篇章就要翻过去了。他们默默等待着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Had Van Ryberg fewer troubles on his hands, he would have found it entertaining to study the Press reactions to Stormgren's disappearance. For the past month, the world's papers had divided themselves into two sharply defined groups. The Western press, on the whole, approved of Karellen's plan to make all men citizens of the world. The Eastern countries, on the other hand, were undergoing violent but largely synthetic spasms of national pride. Some of them had been independent for little more than a generation, and felt that they had been cheated out of their gains. Criticism of the Overlords was widespread and energetic; after an initial period of extreme caution, the Press had quickly found that it could be as rude to Karellen as it liked and nothing would happen. Now it was excelling itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很想认真阅读一下各媒体关于斯妥格恩失踪的报道，只是手里麻烦事太多。自上个月以来，世界舆论分成了相互对立的两派，总的来说，西方赞成卡瑞林的计划，让地球上所有的人都成为世界公民；东方却号召人们起来开展轰轰烈烈的主权运动——些国家获得独立还不到二十年，不甘心自己的胜利果实就这样被盗走。各大媒体对外星人进行了强有力地谴责，最初还言辞谨慎，很快就发现无论怎样卡瑞林都没有任何反应。现在各媒体更是炒得沸沸扬扬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had been doing this only for a moment when there was a sudden click and a section of the darkness slid aside. He caught a glimpse of a man silhouetted against a dimly lit background; then the door closed again and the darkness returned. It happened so swiftly that he had no chance to see anything of the room in which he was lying.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now Stormgren had gone, no one knew where. The tumult suddenly subsided as the world realized that it had lost the only man through whom the Overlords, for their own strange reasons, would speak to Earth. A paralysis seemed to descend upon the press and radio commentators; but in the silence could be heard the voice of the Freedom League, anxiously protesting its innocence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩失踪后，没有人知道他的去向。世界上所有的反抗活动都停止了。人们意识到他们失去了惟一一个能和外星人联系的人，各种舆论一片寂静，只有自由团出来申辩，声称自己与此事毫不相关。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the darkness his hand encountered a bare stone wall, cold to the touch. He froze instantly, mind and body paralysed by the impact of the unexpected.

<div class="line_en">An instant later, he was dazzled by the light of a powerful electric torch. The beam flickered across his face, held him steadily for a moment, then dipped to illuminate the whole bed -- which was, he now saw, nothing more than a mattress supported on rough planks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了一会儿，一束手电的强光射来，照得斯妥格恩两眼发花，那束光晃过他的脸，往下移到了床上，原来这床不过是一块放在粗木板上的垫子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something about the last sentence that caught Stormgren's attention, so that the angry questions he had been about to ask died upon his lips. He stared back into the darkness, then replied calmly; "How long have I been Unconscious?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一句话提醒了斯妥格恩，他放弃了原本想问的问题，只是望着声音传来的方向，镇定地问：“我昏迷了多久？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Partly to gain time, partly to test his own reactions, Stormgren swung his legs over the side of the bed. He was still wearing his night-clothes, but they were badly crumpled and seemed to have gathered considerable dirt. As he moved he felt a slight dizziness -- not enough to be unpleasant but sufficient to convince him that he had indeed been drugged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯妥格恩为了赢得时间考虑眼前的形势，同时也想看看自己的身体是否还能活动自如，就把腿移向床边，这时他才发现自己还穿着睡袍，睡袍早就皱得不成样子了，还积满了灰尘。这一动，他感到有些头晕，好在不十分严重，但足以证明自己被麻醉过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The corridor was dimly lit by oil lamps at intervals, and for the first time Stormgren could see Joe clearly. He was a man of about fifty, and must have weighed well over two hundred pounds. Everything about him was outsize, from the stained battledress that might have come from any of half a dozen armed forces, to the startlingly large signet ring on his left band. A man built on this scale probably would not bother to carry a gun. It should not be difficult to trace him, thought Stormgren, if he ever got out of this place. He was a little depressed to realize that Joe must also be perfectly well aware of this fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过道里光线昏暗，每隔一段距离点着一盏油灯。这时，他才看清了乔的模样，四十岁左右，体重两百磅有余，从那件脏兮兮的、不知属于哪个部队的作战服一直到左手手指上戴的那枚图章戒指，全是特大号的。很少人能有如此高大的体格，他也许根本没必要佩带枪支，就是离开这个地方，要再找到他也绝非难事。一想到乔自己也明白这一点，他又不免有些灰心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The walls around them, though occasionally faced with concrete, were mostly bare rock. It was dear to Stormgren that he was in some disused mine, and he could think of few more effective prisons. Until now the fact of his kidnapping had failed to worry him greatly. He had felt that, whatever happened, the immense resources of the Overlords would soon locate and rescue him. Now he was not so sure. He had already been gone several days -- and nothing had happened. There must be a limit even to Karellen's power, and if he were indeed buried in some remote continent, all the science of the Overlords might be unable to trace him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was all rather like a Hollywood thriller," said Joe cheerfully. "We weren't sure if Karellen kept a watch on you, so we took somewhat elaborate precautions. You were knocked out by gas in the air-conditioner -- that was easy. Then we carried you out into the car -- no trouble at all. All this, I might say, wasn't done by any of our people. We hired -- er -- professionals for the job. Karellen may get them -- in fact, he's supposed to -- but he'll be no wiser. When it left your house, the car drove into a long road tunnel not a thousand kilometres from New York. It came out again on schedule at the opposite end, still carrying a drugged man extraordinarily like the Secretary-General. Quite a while later a large truck loaded with metal cases emerged in the opposite direction and drove to a certain airfield where the cases were loaded aboard a freighter on perfectly legitimate business. I'm sure the owners of those cases would be horrified to know how we employed them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“整个过程就像好莱坞惊险大片中演的那样，”乔兴致勃勃地讲述起来，“我们不知道卡瑞林是不是在保护你，因此特别谨慎。你吸入空调送进去的毒气后被麻醉了，这很简单。然后你被抬进一辆小车，也很顺利。这些都不是我们的人干的，我们雇了一些专干这种事的人。卡瑞林现在可能已经抓到他们了，我想他能做到的也就是抓住他们，仅此而已。小车离开你家后，径直开到了距离纽约不到一千公里的一条公路隧道里，当它从隧道另一头出来时，车里的那个人依然不省人事，他的长相足以和你——秘书长先生乱真。不久，一辆运载着金属容器的大卡车迎面驶过，开到附近的机场卸货，货物被装上一架运输机，整个过程没有任何违法操作，货主如果知道我们是怎样利用他们的，肯定会吓得半死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Meanwhile the car that had actually done the job continued elaborate evasive action towards the Canadian border. Perhaps Karellen's caught it by now; I don't know or care. As you'll see -- I do hope you appreciate my frankness -- our whole plan depended on one thing. We're pretty sure that Karellen can see and hear everything that happens on the surface of the Earth -- but unless he uses magic, not science, he can't see underneath it. So he won't know about the transfer in the tunnel -- at least until it's too late. Naturally we've taken a risk, but there were also one or two other safeguards I won't go into now. We may want to use them again, and it would be a pity to give them away."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的目的很明确，”乔说，“既然抗议没有用处，就采取一些别的措施。地下抵抗运动以前就有，不管卡瑞林如何神通广大，他都会发现我们很难对付。我们在为独立而战，别误会，我说的不是暴力行动，至少最初不会。外星人最终还是得通过地球上的人来实现他们的统治，我们要让他们统治得不那么顺利。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Starting with me, I suppose, thought Stormgren. He wondered if the other had given him more than a fraction of the whole story. Did they really think that these gangster methods would influence Karellen in the slightest? On the other hand, it was quite true that a well-organized resistance movement could make life very difficult. For Joe had put his finger on the one weak spot in the Overlords' rule. Ultimately, all their orders were carried out by human agents. If these were terrorized into disobedience, the whole system might collapse. It was only a faint possibility, for Stormgren felt confident that Karellen would soon find some solution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你们就拿我开刀吧，斯妥格恩想，这已经不是在谈绑架的事了。他们真的以为卡瑞林会在意这种野蛮行径？有组织的抵抗运动只会使人们自己的生活变得更艰难。但他的话也击中了外星人统治政策的致命弱点，说到底，他们所有的命令还得通过人去执行。如果人们的抵抗运动掺杂了恐怖主义色彩，整个统治体系就可能崩溃，只是这种可能性太小了，卡瑞林很快就能找到相应的解决办法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The kidnapping had been beautifully organized, there was no doubt of that. Stormgren might be anywhere on Earth, and there seemed little hope of tracing him. Yet something must be done, decided Van Ryberg, and done quickly. Despite the jest, he had so often made, his real feeling towards Karellen was one of overwhelming awe.

<div class="line_en">It was true; Karellen's ship, that never-changing symbol of the Overlords, was no longer in the sky. He searched the heavens as far as he could see, and found no trace of it. Then, suddenly, it seemed as if night had swiftly fallen. Coming down from the north, its shadowed underbelly black as a thundercloud, the great ship was racing low over the towers of New York. Involuntarily, Van Ryberg shrank away from the onrushing monster. He had always known how huge the ship of the Overlords really were -- but it was one thing to see them far away in space, and quite another to watch them passing overhead like demon-driven clouds.</div>

Doubtless you are sincere in believing as you do; I can understand your fear that the traditions and cultures of little countries will be overwhelmed when the World State arrives.

<div class="line_cn" title="他在出口处站住了，眼睛一时难以适应外面强烈的阳光。过了一会儿，他才看清身边放着一台破烂的采矿机械，一条铁轨通向山下，几公里外的山脚下有一大片茂密的森林，远处还折射着湖水的波光。凭着直觉，他断定自己在南美的某个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Six times he encountered the spheres on his way to the open. At first he wondered if, somehow, the robot was managing to keep ahead of him; then he guessed that there must be a chain of the machines maintaining a complete circuit down into the depths of the mine. At the entrance a group of guards formed a piece of improbable statuary, watched over by yet another of the ubiquitous spheres. On the hillside a few metres away lay the little flying machine in which Stormgren had made all his journeys to Karellen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一路上，他总共遇到了六次金属球。起初，他以为给自己指路的是同一个，后来他想它们应当有六个，共同组成一个直达矿井深处的完整的通讯线路。在山腰的出口处，一群看守塑像般一动不动，旁边悬浮着另一个金属球。几米之外停着那艘熟悉的小飞船，以前就是它把自己送到卡瑞林飞船里去的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he climbed into the little flying machine, Stormgren had a last glimpse of the mine entrance and the men frozen around it. Then the door sealed behind him and with a sigh of relief he sank back upon the familiar couch. For a while he waited until he had recovered his breath; then he uttered a single, heart-felt syllable:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他最后望了一眼矿井入口和愣在那里的看守，钻进飞船。门关上了，他松了口气，跌坐在熟悉的靠椅上，着急地等着卡瑞林来说话，后来还是忍不住自己先开口了：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry I couldn't rescue you before. But you see how very important it was to wait until all the leaders had gathered here."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别着急，”卡瑞林回答了，“至少先听我解释。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very well," said Stormgren darkly, "I'm listening." He was beginning to suspect that he had been no more than bait In an elaborate trap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，我听着呢。”他感觉自己像一个精心设计的陷阱里的诱饵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've had a -- perhaps 'tracer' is the best word for it -- on you For some time," began Karellen. "Though your late friends were correct in thinking that I couldn't follow you underground, I was able to keep track until they brought you to the nine. That transfer in the tunnel was ingenious, but when the first car ceased to react it gave the plan away and I soon located you again. Then it was merely a matter of waiting. I knew that once they were certain I'd lost you, the leaders would come here and I'd be able trap them all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在你身上安放了一种设备，叫它跟踪器也许更恰当，”卡瑞林说话了，“你的那些新朋友认为在地面以下，我就不能再跟踪你了。他们说得有道理，但我一直跟着你到了那个矿井的入口。隧道里的那个调包计很有意思，只是后来我发现小车里没有了你的信号，就明白是怎么回事了。很快，我又找到你了，接下来就是等待，我知道他们的头儿如果确信我找不到你，就会到这里来，这样我可以把他们一网打尽。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Until now," said Karellen, "I had no way of telling who of the two and a half billion men on this planet were the real heads of the organization. Now that they're located, I can trace their movements anywhere on Earth, and can watch their actions in detail if I want to. That's far better than locking them up. If they make any moves, they'll betray their remaining comrades. They're effectively neutralized, and they know it. Your rescue will be completely inexplicable to them, for you must have vanished before their eyes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“到目前为止，我还不能确定这个地球上的二十五亿人中哪些人是那些组织的首领。有了这些人，我就可以跟踪他们在任何地方的一举一动，这不比把他们关起来强多了？只要他们采取行动，就会出卖自己的同志。他们很明白这一点，现在他们只能保持中立。至于你被救的事，它将永远是个谜。你在他们眼前就这样突然消失了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a pity to do it in my last few weeks of office," he said finally, "but from now on I'm going to have a guard on my house. Pieter can be kidnapped next time. How has he managed, by the way?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's lucky for him," said Stormgren, still somewhat aggrieved. "And by the way, have you had any word yet from your superiors -- about showing yourself to us? I'm sure now that it's the strongest argument your enemies have. Again and again they told me, 'We'll never trust the Overlords until we can see them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他很走运。”斯妥格恩多少还有点怒气难平，“你从头儿那儿得到答复了吗？就是露面那事。拒绝露面是那些人反对你的最大理由，他们一遍又一遍地告诉我，除非见到你们的真面目，否则不会信任你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. I've heard nothing. But I know what the answer must be." Stormgren did not press the matter.

Yes, perhaps instruments could be devised…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，我什么也没听到。但我知道答案是什么。”斯妥格恩没有像以前那样追问个没完，一个新的计划正在他的脑海里形成。那个威尔士人审问自己的话再次闪过，对，也许能设计出这样的仪器…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've watched him carefully this last week, and have deliberately avoided helping him. On the whole he's done very well -- but he's not the man to take your place."</div>
