<div class="line_en">It is my turn at the wok. My classmates leer over me, ready for a laugh. Every afternoon, we cook in the same teams of ten, gathered round a table, with two gas burners, a couple of woks, a chopping board and a few bowls and plates at our disposal. None of my particular friends are in my team, so I am obliged to work with nine young men who make strenuous efforts to avoid talking to me, and who are openly sceptical about the idea of a foreign woman becoming a Sichuanese chef. It is tedious, really. I have to fight to participate when we divide up the tasks, or else I find they all scarper to the store cupboards and the sinks without me. And I have to draw on all my reserves of bossy older sisterliness to engage them in the most trivial conversation. But, as always, the cooking itself makes me so sweetly happy that I don't really care about these inconveniences.</div>

<div class="line_en">I flick on the gas tap and light the burner, ladle some oil into the blackened wok. My teammates smirk, and someone makes a witty remark under his breath in Sichuanese dialect which I don't understand. I just ignore him, and concentrate on the cooking. I have prepped my ingredients already: the snaking strands of pork, marinated in salt, soy sauce, Shaoxing wine and wet pea-starch; the ribbons of cloud-ear fungus; the pale-green slivers of lettuce stem; the pickled chilli paste; the garlic, spring onion and ginger. These are the ingredients of fish-fragrant pork, one of the most famous of all Sichuanese dishes.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the oil is hot, I tip in the pork and stir-fry briskly as the slivers separate and whiten. Then I tilt the wok, so the oil pools at the side, directly over the flame, and add the pickled chilli paste, which stains the oil a deep, rich orange. I scatter in the ginger and garlic, stirring as they release their punchy fragrances, add the vegetables, mix everything together. Finally, I pour in the sauce, a mixture of sugar, soy sauce and vinegar, with a little starch to make it thicken and cling. Seconds later, the dish is finished, and I ladle it neatly onto a small oval plate. It has turned out rather well. The lazy strands of pork are tender and glossy, entwined with the dark fungus and the green lettuce. The red oil pools prettily around the edges of the dish, and it smells extraordinarily good. My classmates are disappointed by my success, and I feel extremely smug. Ha!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="油烧热了，我把猪肉入锅，迅速翻炒，炒到肉丝相互分离变白。接着我把锅倾斜，肉丝拨到一边。泡椒末加入锅底的油里炒，整个锅里呈现出深浓的橙色。继续倒入姜蒜翻炒，浓郁的香味扑鼻而来。再加入配菜，所有东西翻炒均匀。最后，把提前准备好的糖、酱油、醋、水豆粉调和的酱料倒进去，勾芡收汁。数秒以后，菜炒好了。我手脚利落地把锅中物盛入一只椭圆盘中，样子看着很不错：肉丝慵懒地与黑木耳和绿莴笋缠绕在一起，发出柔软的光泽；菜的周围溢出诱人的红油，味道闻着那叫个香啊！围观的同学好像对我的成功相当失望，我却得意得很。哈！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We all take turns to cook amid the jostling, subversive crowd. The boys are merciless in their criticism of each other, and of me. If anything goes wrong, they jeer and giggle. Every failure is jubilantly ridiculed. 'Too much oil!' 'It's all dried out!' 'The sauce has gone all sticky!' 'You stupid melon! (sha gua)' As each of us finishes, we troop off to the side of the room, where Teacher Lu is ready to assess our efforts. He sits there with his usual benign smile, but is precise in his criticisms. He ticks us off for careless or irregular cutting: 'Bu hao kan! (unattractive!) You've got thin slivers, thick slivers and chopstick strips, all mixed up together!' He can tell from the smell of the dish and the texture of the pork if the oil temperature was too hot or too cool, and he will taste to see how skilfully we have balanced the flavours. Today, he approves of my fish-fragrant pork. 'Bu cuo bu cuo (not bad, not bad),' he says.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything we made at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine was cooked from scratch. We had only rudimentary equipment: there were no mincing machines or food processors to save us time. If we were making pork balls, we had to pound the meat to a paste with the backs of our cleavers, teasing out with our fingertips every wisp of sinew. Eggwhites were whisked on a plate, with a pair of chopsticks. If we were using walnuts, we had to crack them open, soak them and then, laboriously, peel off their skins. ('Sichuanese cookery is so ma fan, so much trouble,' moaned one of my classmates, coaxing reluctant shreds of skin from a walnut kernel, dismayed at the prospect of a lifetime performing such tasks.) Some of the ingredients were still alive when we got them. We scrambled competitively to be first to collect our team's allocation of, say, thirty glinting crucian carp, which we had to clean in the sinks on the balcony, ripping their gills out and slitting their bellies as they jumped and twitched in our hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在四川烹饪高等专科学校做的每一道菜，都是从最原始的形态开始。下厨装备也都很初级、很简陋：没什么绞肉机或者食物处理机帮我们节省时间。想做猪肉圆子的话，就拿刀背把猪肉剁成泥，拿手指尖把每一根肉筋细细地挑出来。蛋清就放在一个盘子里，拿筷子搅匀至起白沫。菜里要用到核桃仁，就得自己把核桃砸开，浸泡之后艰难地剥掉薄薄的核桃皮。（“川菜简直麻烦。”一个同学一边抱怨，一边把核桃仁外皮给一点点弄下来。想到有可能一辈子都要做这样的苦活，他一脸的灰心丧气。）有些食材到我们手里还是活的。我们争先恐后去抢着挑的，可能是三十条闪着鳞光的鲫鱼，必须要去阳台上把鳞片刮下来，掏出鱼鳃和内脏，把鱼肚挖出来，而它们就一直在我们手里乱跳狂扭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately we are not allowed to eat what we cook, though we may taste it. The finished dishes are bagged up and sold from a table at the school gates to people in the neighbourhood. They are brave, these guinea pigs, because it's such a lottery: one day they might end up with an appetising supper, another day some ghastly, oversalted, stodgy mess. Reluctantly, I hand over my dish in its haze of delicious aromas, and go back to watch my classmates run the gauntlet of their peers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Life in Chengdu in the mid-nineties appealed to this old longing of mine for the fundamentals of cookery. There were no shortcuts. Centuries-old methods of food preservation were used in most households. On sunny days, the backstreets were hung with cabbage leaves, which had to be half-dried before they could be rubbed with salt and spices and packed into jars to ferment. There were coils of drying tangerine peel on everyone's windowsills. And as the Chinese New Year approached, people started to smoke bacon and make sausages, hanging them out to wind-dry under the eaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九十年代中期的成都生活接近我多年的夙愿：回归到烹饪的基本，没有捷径，无法偷懒。很多人家都还在使用有几百年历史的方法来储存食物。响晴的天气，小街小巷的住家挂满了青菜叶，要晒得半干才能取下来，揉进盐和香料，放进密封好的罐子里发酵。家家户户的窗棂上都摆着陈皮。临近春节的时候，人们开始腌腊肉、做香肠，挂在屋檐下风干。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a child, my dream was to live in a cottage in the country, doing everything by hand. I wanted to grow my own vegetables, rear chickens, bake bread, make jam. Growing up, I was moved by the beauty of raw things, the silvery gleam of a fish in my hands, pink juices flowing from a cut beetroot. I enjoyed the kind of basic kitchen jobs that might seem boring to anybody else, like picking over a trayful of rice for stones, or topping and tailing green beans. Teenaged, I learned how to pluck and clean pheasants, and I made my own pastry and mayonnaise by hand. My family mocked me. 'When you grow up, you'll have machines to do everything. It's just a fantasy.' (I think I have the last laugh: years later, I still live without a television, a dishwasher or a microwave, and I still pluck pheasants and make pastry and mayonnaise by hand.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小时候，我梦想着有一天能住在乡下的农庄，什么都亲手来做。我想自己种菜、自己养鸡、自己烤面包、自己做果酱。长大的过程中，我被生鲜的美深深打动：手中闪着银光的鱼、切开的甜菜根流下的粉色汁水。厨房与水槽里，别人看着无聊的琐碎活路，我却特别喜欢做。比如拣米（2）择菜什么的。十几岁的时候，我学会了给野鸡拔毛、处理肉皮；点心面皮和蛋黄酱也是亲手制作。家人都爱开我玩笑：“长大了，你就会买各种机器来做所有的事情了，真是想想就美啊。”（我想我笑到了最后：多年以后，我仍然没有电视、洗碗机、微波炉。我还是会给野鸡拔毛、处理肉皮，亲手做点心面皮和蛋黄酱。）【注：（2）作者小时候从印度商店买米，有时候米中还会掺些小石子，所以人们把米放在托盘里，看到有小石子就挑出来。拣米是一种独特的时代现象。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was only one thing that jarred for me in this prelapsarian world of cooking, and that was the use of monosodium glutamate, or MSG. Like most Westerners, I saw MSG as a nasty artificial additive, used only in junk food and trashy takeaways. In England, you never find MSG in a domestic kitchen, and it would be a public scandal if it was discovered in the store cupboard of a serious restaurant. Yet in China, every kitchen has its jar of MSG, tucked away amid the soy sauces and vinegars. Top chefs use it in their most acclaimed dishes, and it is treated as a normal seasoning at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, the nation's top school for chefs. The Chinese even call this white powder wei jing, 'the essence of taste', and translate it into English as 'gourmet powder' (jing itself means not only 'essence', but also, among other things, 'refined, perfect, meticulous, clever, skilled, energy, spirit and sperm', which gives you some idea of what a wonderful word it is). There is no shame, in China, in using MSG.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个原始纯粹的烹饪世界，只有一件事让我震动和惶恐，就是使用味精。我和大多数西方人一样，觉得味精是糟糕的人造添加剂，只有垃圾食品和毫无营养的外卖中才会使用。英国人家的厨房里是不可能有味精的；要是某家还算像样的餐厅橱柜里发现了味精，那就是厨界丑闻了。然而，中国的每家厨房里都有一罐味精，和酱油、醋放在一起。顶级大厨会在自己的拿手菜中放味精。在四川烹饪高等专科学校，全国最棒的厨师学校，味精也被当作最平常不过的调味料。听听这中文名字，“味精”，味道的精华（而且“精”还可以解释为精美、精细、精明、精湛、精神、精液……你看看，这是个多好的字）。在中国，用味精完全不需要脸红心跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the cooking school, the pickles we used in our recipes were made in the traditional manner. There was a storeroom where waist-high clay jars lurked in a constant twilight. We lifted the inverted bowls that covered their mouths, and reached into the glowing scarlet of pickled chillies in brine, plucking them out with our chopsticks. When we wanted to lend a rich brown colour to a stew, we caramelised our own sugar in oil. There were no ready-made sauces, except for the slowly fermented chilli bean paste; we mixed them ourselves from the essential seasonings: sugar, vinegar, soy sauce and sesame paste in various combinations. I loved the alchemy of it, conjuring such basic elements into gold, my only tools a knife, a ladle, a board and a wok.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在烹饪学校，菜谱里用的泡菜是用传统方法制作的。学校有个储藏室，总是光线幽暗，其中“潜伏”着很多齐腰高的陶坛。抬起倒盖着坛口的大碗，把筷子伸进盐水中那层鲜红发光的泡椒，把泡菜挑出来。烧菜的时候想要增添醇厚的棕色，我们会用油炒糖，变成焦焦的样子。除了慢慢发酵腌制的豆瓣酱之外，再没什么现成的酱料了。我们用最本原的调味料自己来混搭：糖、醋、酱油和芝麻酱，很多种排列组合。我热爱这其中的魔力，仿佛把最基础的元素炼成了闪闪发光的黄金，而手头的工具只有一把菜刀、一把大杓、一个菜板和一口炒锅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">MSG is not a traditional ingredient in Chinese cookery. It was discovered in 1908 by the Japanese scientist, Kikunae Ikeda, who was intrigued by the intensely delicious taste of the broth made from kombu seaweed. In his laboratory, he managed to isolate its source, glutamates in the seaweed, and to their wonderful taste he gave the name umami, derived from the Japanese word for 'delicious'. His findings led directly to the industrial manufacture in Japan, and then worldwide, of MSG.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="味精并非中厨里的传统调味料，其发明者是日本科学家池田菊苗。他从一碗海带汤异常鲜美的味道中得到灵感，在实验室提纯了海带里的呈味物质，并把这独特的味道称为“旨味”（相当于中文的“鲜味”）。他的发现直接引发了日本对味精的工业化制造生产，接着又扩展到全世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the beginning, MSG was thought by scientists to be just a 'flavour enhancer', a substance with little taste of its own, but able to react with various savoury flavours to produce a pleasant sensory kick. Recently, however, biologists have found that human tongues have specialised receptors that pick up on the taste of MSG and a wider family of umami compounds, and that some of our brain cells respond specifically to the umami taste. This has led to growing acceptance that umami is not merely a flavour-enhancer, but a discrete 'fifth taste' in its own right, alongside the traditional quartet of sweet, sour, salty and bitter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，科学家们认为味精只是“增味剂”，本身没什么味道，但是可以和很多菜肴中的味道发生反应，产生感官上的愉悦。然而近年来，生物学家发现，人的舌头有专门的神经末梢，对味精和别的“旨味”合成物特别敏感，还有些脑细胞也会对“旨味”有特别的反应。这样的发现使得大家越来越普遍地认为，“旨味”不仅是增味剂，而且本身也是独立于传统“酸甜苦咸”之外的“第五味”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although umami is associated with manufactured MSG, the taste is found naturally in many animal and vegetable foods, such as tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms and tuna. Their umami flavours come from the building blocks of proteins, amino acids and nucleotides, which include not only glutamates, but also inosinates and guanylates. These delicious molecules appear when animal and vegetable proteins break down, which is why processes such as cooking, ripening and fermentation intensify umami tastes. Many of the flavours adored by Europeans and Americans, like those of Parma ham and Parmesan cheese, owe their intensity to these umami compounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“旨味”虽然和人工制造的味精联系在一起，但大自然中很多动物与蔬菜也含有这种味道，比如番茄、香菇和金枪鱼。它们的“旨味”来自组成蛋白质的氨基酸和核苷酸模块，这里头不止含有味精的组成部分谷氨酸，还有肌苷酸和鸟苷酸。动物与蔬菜的蛋白质分解开来，这些美味的分子就出现了，所以烹饪、熟成和发酵这些过程能够更烘托出食材中的“旨味”。欧美人很喜欢的味道，比如帕尔马火腿与帕玛森干酪中的香醇浓郁，都多亏了“旨味”化合物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Chinese have been using umami-rich products such as black fermented soybeans and related sauces for more than two millennia. Intensely flavoured broths enhanced by cured ham and dried seafood are among the staple flavourings of traditional Chinese cuisine. Cheesy fermented beancurd and the preserved duck eggs that so appalled me on my first visit to Hong Kong are both prized for their strong and complex umami tastes. In a sense, MSG is simply a continuation of this tradition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两千多年来，中国人一直都在使用富含“旨味”的产品，比如豆豉和相关的酱料。传统中厨的主要调味技巧中，就有往浓汤里加火腿和干海味提鲜。第一次去香港时让我受到巨大惊吓的皮蛋，以及后来遇到的腐乳，都是中国人民喜闻乐见的食物，因为其中的“旨味”强烈又繁复。从某种程度来说，味精不过是这种传统的延续。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In China, it's different. People like science. In a country where famine and hunger are recent memories, and drought and floods a constant threat to agriculture, it's not surprising that people are more open to the possibilities of genetic modification. Advances in food technology and the availability of new household gadgets like washing machines have only just begun to liberate women from the treadmill of domestic labour: it's too early for nostalgia about 'doing everything by hand'. And there are also historical reasons for a widespread trust in the benefits of science and technology.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国就不一样了。人们欢迎科学、倡导科学。在这个国家，饥荒的记忆还未远去，旱涝灾害也时时威胁着农业的收成，所以人们对转基因的可能性抱着更开放的态度也就不奇怪了。在这里，食品科技的进步和洗衣机等新的家用电器才刚刚开始把妇女从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来。中国人对“一切靠双手”的时代的怀念还早得很。大家普遍相信科学技术会带来好处，这其中还有历史原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But why did the Chinese take to the use of manufactured MSG with such joy when the West rejected it? I suspect it's partly because the Chinese generally have a positive view of science and technology. The kind of Europeans who love to cook and eat often regard science as the enemy: epicurianism tends to go hand in hand with a kind of back-to-nature fundamentalism. People like me think that advances in food technology are forced on humanity by corrupt scientists in the pay of greedy multinational companies. We expect that genetic modification will lead to ecological disaster; we are certain that pesticides will give us cancer. MSG, as a relatively recent, and artificial, seasoning, is inherently dubious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，为何西方人这么排斥人工制造的味精，中国人却欢天喜地地敞开了用呢？我猜部分原因是，中国人普遍对科学技术抱着积极的态度。欧洲的厨师和“吃货”通常都觉得科学是天敌：享乐主义必须和“回归自然”的哲学并行。我这样的人觉得，食品技术的进步是强加在人类头上的，都是贪婪的跨国公司付钱让堕落腐败的科学家一手制造的。我们认为转基因会带来生态灾难，我们肯定农药会让人罹患癌症。味精，作为一种相对年轻的人造调味料，天生就是非常可疑的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I first lived in China, traditional cookery, Tai Chi and Traditional Chinese Medicine were the norm, at least for the older generation. Now I meet young people who tell me they prefer sports to martial arts, pills to Chinese herbal medicine, and hamburgers to Chinese food, because they are 'modern'. In chefs' circles, the hot topic of discussion in recent years has been 'Western nutrition', which is seen as 'very scientific'. I wear myself out reminding advocates of Western nutrition that Westerners are totally confused about what they eat, and increasingly fat, cancerous and diabetic. We are drowning in scientific studies, I tell them! One month we are told that a glass of red wine a day will protect our hearts, the next month that it will give us heart attacks. Yesterday we were told to eat only protein and no carbohydrates, today we are told this will give us bad breath and kidney failure. Our food products are plastered with complicated information about salt and sugar content, calories, glycaemic indices -- but does anyone actually know how to eat?

<div class="line_en">In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the evident supremacy of the Western powers triggered a crisis in Chinese identity. Some thinkers and political activists came to see traditional Chinese culture as luo hou (backward), as a millstone round the neck of the nation: they despised it. The future, they thought, lay in Western science and rationality. The philosophical turmoil of the educated class was one of the triggers of revolution. A century later, these anxieties about the Chinese past, and green-eyed envy of the West, are as strong as ever. Ironically, just as the Western middle classes are losing their faith in science, and getting soggy with emotion over the holistic traditions of the East, the Chinese seem to be on the brink of ditching what's left of their own philosophical and technological heritage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Contrast this with the traditional Chinese approach to food which is simple, holistic and, as far as I can see, remarkably beneficial. The older generation may not have figures and facts at their disposal, but they are masters in the art of balance in food. They know what to eat when they suffer from different kinds of illness and indisposition. They vary their diets according to the seasons, and their age. It's one of the things that impressed me most about China, this pervasive knowledge of how to eat well and healthily. 'Your traditional culture of food and medicine is one of the glories of Chinese civilisation! You should be teaching it to us!' I tell Chinese friends. They look at me, surprised and nonplussed, as if such a thought had never occurred to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">MSG, of course, is very modern and scientific, which is clearly part of its appeal. But it must also have taken such a hold because of when it started to become widely available: the seventies. This was a period of great hardship in China, when meat was scarce and even grain was rationed. Suddenly, MSG offered the possibility of emulating the rich, savoury tastes of traditional stocks without using meat. It must have seemed like a miracle. Add a spoonful of MSG to a bowl of hot water, scatter in a few sliced spring onions, and you have a soup of sorts. Sprinkle some into a vegetable stir-fry and it will be fantastically delicious, as if you had added luxury ingredients like chicken oil or Yunnan ham.</div>

We were taught to mix it into dressings for cold meats and vegetables, and to use it as a dip for appetisers. We were told to add MSG to almost everything. It was and is the same in restaurant kitchens, where MSG is used almost as widely as salt.

<div class="line_en">The ubiquity of MSG in Chinese cookery puts me in a difficult position. Instinctively I loathe it, and I never use it when I cook at home. It's fake, it goes against all my principles. And I suspect that the excessive use of MSG in Chinese kitchens corrupts people's palates, deadening them to the pleasures of natural flavours. (Chinese chefs tell me they now have to use MSG, because their customers find everything tastes boring without it.) But is it any worse than refined salt or sugar, both of which are psychologically addictive and damaging in excess? There seems to be no conclusive proof that MSG is harmful to health: the existence of 'Chinese restaurant syndrome' has been widely discredited. Some scientists argue that MSG is a 'neuro-toxin' that overstimulates the pancreas and the nervous system, triggering diseases like autism, asthma, diabetes and obesity: but I'm not in a position to assess their findings myself, and I've seen little reflection of such theories in the wider MSG debate. Furthermore, all my great Chinese culinary heroes use MSG, and their food tastes delicious.</div>

I don't find it necessary, since I buy good ingredients and make my own stocks. I'm also tired of being bombarded with MSG-laden food in Chinese restaurants which makes me thirsty and exhausts my palate. I prefer flavours that are gentler and more natural. For me, MSG is the cook's cocaine, a white powder that offers a turbo-charged intensity of gastronomic pleasure. But isn't life beautiful enough, without taking drugs?</div>

It is simply added to the wok with other seasonings. So I just omitted it, end of story. And given the overwhelming intensity of the natural flavours of Sichuanese cookery, I didn't miss it at all.

<div class="line_en">Our teachers introduced us to the unsavoury aspects of the natural flavours of meat, poultry, fish and seafood, known collectively as yi wei, 'off-tastes', and more specifically as xing (fishy), shan (muttony), and sao (foul, uriney) tastes or odours. As chefs, my classmates and I had to learn how to refine or dispel these unpleasant tastes, and to bring out the delicious xian wei (umami flavours) that lay behind them. So we blanched our ingredients in boiling water, or treated them with salt, Shaoxing wine, crushed spring onion and ginger; and we discarded the bloody juices that leaked from meat and poultry. With foodstuffs where the yi wei were particularly heavy, like beef and mutton, eels and offal, we would add the wine and seasonings with a generous hand, and freshen up the final dishes with garnishes of coriander. Such techniques have been used in China for thousands of years: the chef Yi Yin, who lived in the sixteenth century BC, warned of the fishy, foul and muttony flavours of some ingredients, but said they could become delicious if treated properly.</div>

<div class="line_en">But these fundamentals are common to all Chinese regional cuisines. It's the tiao wei, the mixing of flavours, that is the fundamental skill of the Sichuanese chef and the most fun to learn. Outsiders, Chinese and foreign, tend to stereotype Sichuanese cuisine as being simply 'hot and spicy'. It's a gross oversimplification. What really distinguishes Sichuanese cookery is its mastery of the arts of flavour. Sichuanese chefs delight in combining a variety of basic tastes to create dazzling fu he wei (complex flavours). A well-orchestrated Sichuanese banquet will titillate your palate in every conceivable way: it will awaken your tastebuds through the judicious use of chilli oil, stimulate your tongue and lips with tingly Sichuan pepper, caress your palate with a spicy sweetness, electrify you with dry fried chillies, soothe you with sweet-and-sour, calm your spirits with a tonic soup.

<div class="line_en">As trainee chefs, my classmates and I studied a canon of some twenty-three 'official' complex flavours -- the equivalent, perhaps, of studying the composition of the 'official' French sauces. It wasn't a matter of exact measurements or precise ingredients, but of developing a sense of the character of each fu he wei, its balance of flavours, its strength and intensity. Take the fish-fragrant flavour (yu xiang wei) of our pork sliver recipe, for example, which derives its curious name from the fact that it uses the seasonings of traditional Sichuanese fish cookery (there is no actual fish in 'fish-fragrant' recipes).</div>

It's a classic fu he wei, engaging the palate simultaneously on several levels, and it's one of the most irresistible combinations of tastes you can imagine.

<div class="line_en">This emphasis on flavour makes Sichuanese a robust and confident cuisine. It doesn't rely too much on specialised local ingredients, like the cuisines of the eastern Chinese with their delicate water vegetables and acquatic creatures. You can't make a hairy-crab beancurd without a hairy crab, but you can make a 'fish-fragrant' dish or a 'numbing-and-hot' dish with anything. Perhaps this is why Sichuanese people are so open-minded and open-hearted compared with people in other parts of China: they don't have to worry that contact with the outside world will deprive them of their own identity. Just cover the outside world in a fish-fragrant sauce, and you will make it Sichuanese.</div>

It can be quite overwhelming if you are not used to it, but it's not meant to be like slamming your tongue with a sledgehammer -- more like rousing the palate and awakening it to the other flavours of the meal. There are other permutations of the chilli-and-Sichuan-pepper mix, like hu la wei ('scorched chilli flavour'). Here, the two spices are sizzled in oil until the chillies are darkening, but not yet burnt and bitter: a marvellous taste. Throw in a bit of sweet and sour, and you have gong bao wei, the sweet-sour-scorched chilli combination found in the famous Gong Bao (or Kung Po) chicken. And so on.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the one outsider in the class, I found myself not only learning the theory and practice of cooking, but also absorbing some Chinese ways of imagining flavour. On damp winter days, I knew I should eat more heating food than usual, so I spooned extra chilli oil on to my breakfast dumplings, and I discovered that sourness was refreshing in the sultry heat of summer. I learned how to say that someone who felt jealous in love was 'eating vinegar' (chi cu). And of course, I realised that 'eating bitterness' (chi ku) was the only way to describe the sorrows and hardships of existence. To learn the language of cookery in China was, in part, to learn the language of life.

Had we managed to create the right degree of harmonised chaos for guai wei ('strange flavour'), where sesame paste, sesame oil, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, chilli and Sichuan pepper were mixed together into a sauce for cold chicken?

They were working with the ferocious heat of a coal-burning stove, of a design that hadn't changed much in two thousand years. There was no way of simply turning the heat up or down. Everything depended on the ability of their eyes and noses to function like military radar, picking up on every change in the micro-environment of the cooking pot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，归根结底，看火候还是要看热油或者热水的状态，以及食材与油水发生反应的情况。九十年代中期，四川很多厨师连煤气炉都没有，使用温度计简直就是天方夜谭。他们得对付火势凶猛的煤炉子，这种厨具的设计两千年来都没怎么变过，根本不可能简单地把火开大关小。一切都要依靠他们那军事雷达一般高速运转的眼睛和鼻子，不放过锅里“微环境”中每一个蛛丝马迹的变化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, my classmates and I had to learn to recognise when the oil was hot enough to coax out the deep-red colour of the chilli-bean paste in our fish-fragrant pork, but not so hot that it would scorch it; when it was hot enough to set the velvety starch-and-water gloss on slivers of pork, but not so hot that the slivers would be dry and chewy. Garlic had to be sizzled to unlock its richness of flavour, but not for so long that it became bitter. As soon as we could see bubbles like 'fish-eyes' rising in our syrups, we had to remove the pan from the heat.

<div class="line_en">Among the five tastes and three materials, the nine boilings and nine transformations, fire is the modulator. At times fierce, at times gentle, it eliminates fishiness, removes foulness and dispels muttoniness. Thus the control of fire is fundamental to nurturing the inherent qualities of all ingredients. Harmonious blending depends on the sweet, the sour, the bitter, the pungent and the salty. But as to when each is added and in what quantity, this is a matter of extremely subtle balancing, for each has its own effect. The transformations that occur in the ding [cooking pot or cauldron] are so supremely wonderful and delicate that the mouth cannot express them in words, nor the mind comprehend them. They are like the fine-tuned skills of the archer and the charioteer, the fluctuations of yin and yang, the passing of the seasons.</div>

I would rise early in my worker's flat near the university, and cycle across the city, picking up a bowlful of rice porridge or dumplings in chilli sauce for breakfast on the way. Familiar shopkeepers and street vendors would greet me as I passed. 'Chu shi, ni hao! Chef! Hello!' some of them would say (used, by now, to my sniffing and tasting, my incessant culinary questions). At school, I put on my chef's whites, tied back my hair, unwrapped my cleaver, and spent the day in a kind of kitchen bliss.</div>

Often I would be distracted by a chance conversation, and stay out until late.

<div class="line_en">Sometimes I threw dinner parties in my flat, testing my latest recipes on Bamboo Bar veterans like Davide and Pasha, or making gnocchi with the Italians. By Western standards, my flat was a grotty place to live. It was drafty and damp in winter; hot and infested with mosquitoes in summer. Laundry, hung out on the balcony for more than a few hours, became grey with fallout from the polluted sky. My mattress and bedding never seemed to be entirely dry. Strange creatures lived in the bamboo furniture; I could hear them munching quietly at night. Fat cockroaches patrolled the kitchen: every evening I went hunting with my spatula, splatting them against the tiles. Occasionally a rat paid a visit, too, and I found myself devising a trap made from a bra, a tape cassette, a plastic basin and a heavy dictionary (amazingly, it worked).

I spent days in the restaurant, not only during my time at the cooking school, but also when I returned to Chengdu in the following years. There I learned the arts of the 'white board' (bai'an), as they call pastry-making in China (the other branch of cookery is known as the 'red board', hong'an). I sat for hours with the gossipy wrappers of the famous Long ('dragon') wontons, many of whom had been there for decades, as they turned out hundreds and thousands of dumplings. I learnt how to stuff glutinous riceballs with black sesame paste and to wrap 'cockscomb dumplings'. I made a mess as I tried and failed to master the knack of making bao zi, the little steamed buns with twirly tops, but no one seemed to mind. They just looked at the tangled rags of dough and minced meat I produced with good-natured smiles. Master Fan told me stories, made me laugh, and taught me how to make delicate zheng zheng gao (literally 'steamed steamed cakes' -- it sounds lovely in Chinese -- made from ricemeal and candied lotus seeds) and other rarely seen, old-fashioned snacks. The staff at Long Chao Shou took to calling me, teasingly, Master Fan's 'foreign apprentice'.</div>

Others, written feverishly during a period of intense learning, are filled in a matter of days. And it's not all about food, either. When I'm in China, these notebooks are my life.

Gone was the utilitarianism, the sexlessness, the uniformity and the stultifying boredom of the tail-end of Chinese communism. The whole country was mobilised for action, moving forward by the collective will of 1.2 billion people.
