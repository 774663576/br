<div class="line_en">Maybe her dad would have ice cream… If he did, he'd probably throw it away before Eleanor got there. He was always dropping hints about her weight. Well, he used to, anyway. Maybe when he stopped caring about her altogether, he'd stopped caring about that, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their dad couldn't stand having them even for a few days. He used to pick them up from their mom's house, then drop them off at his mom's house while he went off and did whatever it was that he did on the weekend. (Presumably, lots and lots of marijuana.)</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Eleanor fixated on all the small luxuries strewn and tucked around the house. Packs of cigarettes, newspapers, magazines… Brand-name cereal and quilted toilet paper. His refrigerator was full of things you tossed into the cart without thinking about it just because they sounded good. Custard-style yogurt. Grapefruit juice. Little round cheeses individually wrapped in red wax.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，埃莉诺为屋内四处可见的小奢侈品目眩神迷。一包包的香烟、报纸、杂志、品牌玉米片、卷筒卫生纸…他的冰箱塞满那种你到了超市想都不想，只因为名字好听，就丢进购物车的玩意儿。蛋奶口味奶酪、葡萄柚汁、用红色蜡纸分装的小粒干酪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smoked cigarette after cigarette, and sipped Scotch out of a short glass. Every once in a while the phone would ring, and he'd have a long, laughy conversation with somebody about a car or a deal or a bet. You'd think that every single person who called was his best friend in the whole world. Her dad had baby blond hair and a round, boyish face. When he smiled, which was constantly, his whole face lit up like a billboard. If Eleanor paid too much attention, she hated him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸一根接一根抽着烟，不断啜饮矮杯里的威士忌。偶尔电话响起，他会跟对方说笑半天，聊车子、生意或者赌博。你会以为打电话来的都是他最要好的朋友。她爸爸有着淡金色的头发、孩子气的圆脸。他笑起来时（几乎是时刻不停地笑），整张脸就会像告示牌般点亮。埃莉诺如果太注意他，肯定会觉得不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His duplex had changed since the last time she'd been here, and it was more than just the box of Fisher Price toys in the living room and the makeup in the bathroom.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they'd first started visiting him here -- after the divorce, but before Richie -- their dad's duplex had been a bare-bones bachelor pad. He didn't even have enough bowls for them all to have soup. He'd served Eleanor clam chowder once in a highball glass. And he only had two towels. "One wet," he'd said, "one dry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚开始来拜访爸爸时——爸爸妈妈离婚后，雷奇到来之前——这个公寓简直是家徒四壁，连喝汤的碗都不够，有一次爸爸还用高脚杯给埃莉诺盛蛤蛎海鲜浓汤。毛巾也只有两条，爸爸说：“一条用来洗澡，一条用来擦干。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She couldn't wait for her dad to leave so that she could start eating everything. There were stacks of Coca-Cola cans in the pantry. She was going to drink Coke like water all night, she might even wash her face with it. And she was going to order a pizza. Unless the pizza came out of her babysitting money. (That would be just like her dad. He'd take you to the cleaners with fine print.) Eleanor didn't care if eating all his food pissed him off or if it freaked out Donna. She might never see either of them again anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她迫不及待地想让爸爸快走，这样她就可以大吃特吃，每样都吃点了。食品柜里有成排的可口可乐，今晚，她要把可乐当水喝，说不定还要拿来洗脸。她还要叫比萨。除非爸爸坚持比萨钱要从保姆费里扣除。（她爸爸就是这样，光凭补充条款部分，就可以把你扣个精光。）埃莉诺不在乎吃光这里的食物会不会激怒爸爸或者唐娜，反正说不定以后也是老死不相往来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="现在，她真希望带了过夜的袋子，这样就可以摸走几罐波巴第大厨罐头和金宝鸡汤面罐头，带给家里的孩子们吃，她进家门时感觉肯定像圣诞老人…">查看中文翻译</div>
