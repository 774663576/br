<div class="line_en">The boy reached the small, abandoned church just as night was falling. The sycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof. He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful night… except for the dream.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they looked at the stars and drank wine together. He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn't believed in the significance of recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the king, the thief, or…"Well, it's a long list. But the path was written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong," he said to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他久久地仰望着天空，然后从褡裢里拿出一瓶酒喝了起来。他回忆起沙漠中的那个夜晚，当时也是仰望着星空，和炼金术士一起喝酒。他想起自己走过的路，想起上帝为他指明财宝所在的奇特方式。假如他不相信重复出现的梦，就不会遇到那个吉卜赛老妇人，还有撒冷王、骗子，还有…“是的，这名单很长。但是道路已被种种预兆确定，我不会走错一步。”他暗暗对自己说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He began to dig at the base of the sycamore.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his shovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest of Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gold masks adorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded with jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago forgotten, and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那分明是炼金术士的声音。男孩微笑起来，继续挖掘。半个小时之后，铁锹碰到了坚硬的东西。一个小时以后，他面前出现了一只装满西班牙古金币的箱子。里面还有宝石、插着红白羽毛的金面具，以及镶着钻石的石像，都是征服者的战利品。很久以来，国家已将它们遗忘，征服者也忘记了告诉他们的后代。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he heard a voice on the wind say. "If I had told you, you wouldn't have seen the Pyramids. They're beautiful, aren't they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不能。”他听到风对他说，“如果我事先告诉你，你就看不到金字塔了。它们很壮美，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You old sorcerer," the boy shouted up to the sky. "You knew the whole story. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters. Couldn't you have saved me from that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老巫师，”男孩自言自语，“你什么都知道，甚至还给我留了一点金子，好让我能回到这个教堂。看到我衣衫褴褛地跑回去，那修士都笑了，你就不能让我免遭这一劫？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used the two stones only once, one morning when he was at a marketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩从褡裢里取出乌凌和图明。这两块宝石他只使用过一次，那是有一天早上，在一个市场里。生活以及生活的道路上总是充满了预兆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a part of his new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old king, whom he would never see again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that came from Africa. It didn't bring with it the smell of the desert, nor the threat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a perfume he knew well, and the touch of a kiss -- a kiss that came from far away, slowly, slowly, until it rested on his lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风刮了起来。是地中海东风，来自非洲。它并未带来沙漠的气息，也未带来摩尔人入侵的凶讯，它带来了一股男孩非常熟悉的香味和一个甜蜜的亲吻。这个吻徐徐地、徐徐地来到面前，落在他的双唇上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's true; life really is generous to those who pursue their Personal Legend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy woman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, he thought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="生活对追随自己天命的人真的很慷慨，男孩想。这时，他想起他必须去一趟塔里法，把全部财宝的十分之一送给那个吉卜赛老妇人。吉卜赛人多精明啊！男孩想，也许是因为他们到处流动的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>
