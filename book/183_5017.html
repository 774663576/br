<div class="line_en">Reepicheep was the only person on board besides Drinian and the two Pevensies who had noticed the Sea People. He had dived in at once when he saw the Sea King shaking his spear, for he regarded this as a sort of threat or challenge and wanted to have the matter out there and then. The excitement of discovering that the water was now fresh had distracted his attention, and before he remembered the Sea People again Lucy and Drinian had taken him aside and warned him not to mention what he had seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">As things turned out they need hardly have bothered, for by this time the Dawn Treader was gliding over a part of the sea which seemed to be uninhabited. No one except Lucy saw anything more of the People, and even she had only one short glimpse. All morning on the following day they sailed in fairly shallow water and the bottom was weedy. Just before midday Lucy saw a large shoal of fishes grazing on the weed. They were all eating steadily and all moving in the same direction. "Just like a flock of sheep," thought Lucy. Suddenly she saw a little Sea Girl of about her own age in the middle of them -- a quiet, lonely-looking girl with a sort of crook in her hand. Lucy felt sure that this girl must be a shepherdess -- or perhaps a fish-herdess and that the shoal was really a flock at pasture. Both the fishes and the girl were quite close to the surface. And just as the girl, gliding in the shallow water, and Lucy, leaning over the bulwark, came opposite to one another, the girl looked up and stared straight into Lucy's face. Neither could speak to the other and in a moment the Sea Girl dropped astern. But Lucy will never forget her face. It did not look frightened or angry like those of the other Sea People. Lucy had liked that girl and she felt certain the girl had liked her. In that one moment they had somehow become friends. There does not seem to be much chance of their meeting again in that world or any other. But if ever they do they will rush together with their hands held out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果他们倒不怎么要伤脑筋了，因为这时黎明踏浪者号正在一片看来没有人的海域里悄悄行驶。除了露茜之外，谁也没再看见海人，即使她也只是匆匆一瞥。第二天整个早晨，他们这条船都在很浅的水里行驶，海底长满水草。晌午前露茜看见一大群鱼在水草上游过。这群鱼都在不断吃食，全都朝一个方向游动。“就跟羊群似的，”露茜心里想。冷不防在鱼群中看见一个小海女，年纪跟她差不多。这是一个举止文静，神情孤独的姑娘，手里拿着一根钩子似的东西。露茜相信这姑娘一定是个牧羊女——也许该说是牧鱼女——那群鱼真像在草原上吃草似的。鱼群和那姑娘都贴近水面。那姑娘在浅水里滑行的时候，露茜正好趴在舷墙上，两个人打了个照面，那姑娘抬眼看着，恰好盯着露茜的脸。谁也不能跟对方说话，因为一会儿工夫那姑娘就落在船尾后了。可是露茜永远忘不了她的脸。这张脸看上去并不像其他海人脸色那么害怕和愤怒。露茜喜欢那姑娘，她感到那姑娘肯定也喜欢她。在那短短一瞬间，不知怎的，她们竟成了朋友。看来在这个世界里或任何其他世界里，她们是没多大机会再见面的了。不过万一见了面，她们准会一齐迫不及待地伸出手去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that for many days, without wind in her shrouds or foam at her bows, across a waveless sea, the Dawn Treader glided smoothly east. Every day and every hour the light became more brilliant and still they could bear it. No one ate or slept and no one wanted to, but they drew buckets of dazzling water from the sea, stronger than wine and somehow wetter, more liquid, than ordinary water, and pledged one another silently in deep draughts of it. And one or two of the sailors who had been oldish men when the voyage began now grew younger every day. Everyone on board was filled with joy and excitement, but not an excitement that made one talk. The further they sailed the less they spoke, and then almost in a whisper. The stillness of that last sea laid hold on them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，有好多天支桅索上没有风，船头处没有泡沫，黎明踏浪者号平平稳稳地朝东行驶，驶过一片平静无波的海面。每天每时光线都变得更加耀眼，但他们竟受得了。没人吃，没人睡，也没人想吃想睡，大家就把水桶往海里汲些耀眼的水，这水比酒更醇，总之比一般水更湿润，更清澈，他们就互相默默干杯，一饮而尽。有一两个水手在开始远航时已经老态龙钟，现在是一天比一天年轻。船上人人都喜气洋洋，兴奋万状，但并没兴奋得想要说话。他们越往远处航行，话说得越少，后来几乎像在说悄悄话了。最后那一片大海的宁静深深抓住了他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If we were in higher latitudes, your Majesty," said Drinian, "I would say it was ice. But it can't be that; not here. All the same, we'd better get men to the oars and hold the ship back against the current. Whatever the stuff is, we don't want to crash into it at this speed!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，如果我们在纬度较高的地方，”德里宁说，“倒可以说这是冰。可是这不可能是冰，这里没冰。话虽这么说，我们最好还是派人划桨，别让船随着水流漂行。不管那是什么玩意儿，我们万万不能以这种速度一头撞进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They did as Drinian said, and so continued to go slower and slower. The whiteness did not get any less mysterious as they approached it. If it was land it must be a very strange land, for it seemed just as smooth as the water and on the same level with it. When they got very close to it Drinian put the helm hard over and turned the Dawn Treader south so that she was broadside on to the current and rowed a little way southward along the edge of the whiteness. In so doing they accidentally made the important discovery that the current was only about forty feet wide and the rest of the sea as still as a pond. This was good news for the crew, who had already begun to think that the return journey to Ramandu's land, rowing against stream all the way, would be pretty poor sport. (It also explained why the shepherd girl had dropped so quickly astern. She was not in the current. If she had been she would have been moving east at the same speed as the ship.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家按德里宁的吩咐去做，船才越来越慢，越来越慢。等他们靠近了，那片白茫茫的神秘色彩还是没有减退。要说这是一片陆地吧，一定是非常奇特的土地，因为它看上去同水一样滑，而且同水面一样高。当他们离这很近的时候，德里宁使劲转舵，把船身转向南面，这样舷侧就对着水流，再沿着那片白茫茫的边缘往南划一段路。正在这么忙的时候，他们偶然有个重大发现，原来这股水流只有四十英尺宽，而其他海面还是跟池塘一样宁静。这对船员无疑是个喜讯，他们已经开始担心重返拉曼杜的岛上那段路程，一路上逆流划桨的话，可要吃苦头了。（这点也说明那个牧鱼姑娘为什么那么快就落在船尾后了。因为她不在那股水流里。如果她当时在水流里，早就跟船的漂流速度一样快地向东漂流了。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And still no one could make out what the white stuff was. Then the boat was lowered and it put off to investigate. Those who remained on the Dawn Treader could see that the boat pushed right in amidst the whiteness. Then they could hear the voices of the party in the boat clear across the still water) talking in a shrill and surprised way. Then there was a pause while Rynelf in the bows of the boat took a sounding; and when, after that, the boat came rowing back there seemed to be plenty of the white stuff inside her. Everyone crowded to the side to hear the news.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，还是没人弄得明白那白茫茫的东西是什么。于是就放下小船，划去侦察。留在大船上的人都看得到小船笔直划进那片白茫茫的东西当中。后来他们都听得到从一汪止水那边传来小船上那些人大惊小怪的说话声。赖尼夫在小船船头测量水深时，大家稍停片刻；事成之后，小船划回来时，船里似乎有不少那种白的东西。人人都挤到舷侧听消息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Probably they were not, but they were very like them. And when, after some consultation, the Dawn Treader turned back into the current and began to glide eastward through the Lily Lake or the Silver Sea (they tried both these names but it was the Silver Sea that stuck and is now on Caspian's map) the strangest part of their travels began. Very soon the open sea which they were leaving was only a thin rim of blue on the western horizon. Whiteness, shot with faintest colour of gold, spread round them on every side, except just astern where their passage had thrust the lilies apart and left an open lane of water that shone like dark green glass. To look at, this last sea was very like the Arctic; and if their eyes had not by now grown as strong as eagles' the sun on all that whiteness -- especially at early morning when the sun was hugest would have been unbearable. And every evening the same whiteness made the daylight last longer. There seemed no end to the lilies. Day after day from all those miles and leagues of flowers there rose a smell which Lucy found it very hard to describe; sweet -- yes, but not at all sleepy or overpowering, a fresh, wild, lonely smell that seemed to get into your brain and make you feel that you could go up mountains at a run or wrestle with an elephant. She and Caspian said to one another, "I feel that I can't stand much more of this, yet I don't want it to stop."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这恐怕不是百合花，但非常相像。经过一番商量，黎明踏浪者号又掉转船头开进水流中，开始往东行驶，穿越百合湖，或称银海（这两个名称他们都试过，不过银海沿用至今，现在凯斯宾的地图上就用这名称），这时他们这次远航最希奇的部分开始了。他们离开的那片开阔的海面一下子就只是西边地平线上一条细细的蓝边。他们周围四面八方都是白茫茫一片，隐隐闪着黄金色，只有船身排开百合花，在船尾处留出一条水面通道，像深绿色的玻璃那样闪闪发光。最后这一片大海看上去很像北冰洋，如果他们的眼睛现在没变得像鹰眼那样厉害，那白茫茫一大片上面的阳光准使他们受不了，尤其是清晨太阳最大的时候。每天傍晚那白茫茫一大片使白天更长了。百合花似乎无边无际。连绵千里的白花天天都散发出一股香味，露茜觉得这味儿很难形容；香虽香——但不是香得使人昏昏欲睡，无法忍受，而是一股清新、强劲、幽雅的味儿，似乎钻进你的脑子，使你觉得自己能跑上高山，或同大象搏斗。她同凯斯宾互相说：“我觉得我再也受不了这股味儿了，可我又不愿闻不到这股味儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

There came a day when they had to row out of the current and feel their way forward at a snail's pace, rowing. And soon it was clear that the Dawn Treader could sail no further east. Indeed it was only by very clever handling that they saved her from grounding.</div>

And instruct my regent, the Dwarf Trumpkin, to give to all these, my shipmates, the rewards I promised them. They have been earned well.

About two o'clock in the afternoon, well victualled and watered (though they thought they would need neither food nor drink) and with Reepicheep's coracle on board, the boat pulled away from the Dawn Treader to row through the endless carpet of lilies. The Dawn Trader flew all her flags and hung out her shields to honour their departure. Tall and big and homelike she looked from their low position with the lilies all round them. And before she was out of sight they saw her turn and begin rowing slowly westward. Yet though Lucy shed a few tears, she could not feel it as much as you might have expected. The light, the silence, the tingling smell of the Silver Sea, even (in some odd way) the loneliness itself, were too exciting.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no need to row, for the current drifted them steadily to the east. None of them slept or ate. All that night and all next day they glided eastward, and when the third day dawned -- with a brightness you or I could not bear even if we had dark glasses on -- they saw a wonder ahead. It was as if a wall stood up between them and the sky, a greenish-grey, trembling, shimmering wall. Then up came the sun, and at its first rising they saw it through the wall and it turned into wonderful rainbow colours. Then they knew that the wall was really a long, tall wave -- a wave endlessly fixed in one place as you may often see at the edge of a waterfall. It seemed to be about thirty feet high, and the current was gliding them swiftly towards it. You might have supposed they would have thought of their danger. They didn't. I don't think anyone could have in their position. For now they saw something not only behind the wave but behind the sun. They could not have seen even the sun if their eyes had not been strengthened by the water of the Last Sea. But now they could look at the rising sun and see it clearly and see things beyond it. What they saw -- eastward, beyond the sun -- was a range of mountains. It was so high that either they never saw the top of it or they forgot it. None of them remembers seeing any sky in that direction. And the mountains must really have been outside the world. For any mountains even a quarter of a twentieth of that height ought to have had ice and snow on them. But these were warm and green and full, of forests and waterfalls however high you looked. And suddenly there came a breeze from the east, tossing the top of the wave into foamy shapes and ruffling the smooth water all round them. It lasted only a second or so but what it brought them in that second none of those three children will ever forget. It brought both a smell and a sound, a musical sound Edmund and Eustace would never talk about it afterwards. Lucy could only say, "It would break your heart." "Why," said I, "was it so sad: " "Sad!! No," said Lucy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="用不着再划桨，因为那股水流不断把他们的小船漂向东面。他们没一个人睡觉，也不吃饭。整整那一夜，第二天整整一天，他们的小船都朝东漂流，到了第三天拂晓——天色那么明亮，你我就算戴上墨镜也受不了——他们看见前面有一大奇观。仿佛是一堵墙挡立在他们和天空之间，一堵青灰色、颤巍巍、亮闪闪的墙。随后出太阳了，初升起时他们是透过这堵墙看见的，太阳幻出奇异的彩虹。他们这才知道那实际上是一道又长又高的波浪——一道永远固定在一处的波浪，恰如瀑布边上经常可以看到的水帘似的。看来有三十英尺高，那股水流正飞速把他们的小船漂向那道波浪。你可能以为他们会想到处境危险吧。他们才不呢。我想，任何人在他们这种处境中都不会想到危险。因为他们现在不仅看到波浪后面的景象，而且看到太阳后面的景象。如果他们的眼力没经受过最后一片大海那水的锻炼，他们连太阳也不能看。可是他们现在竟能看着太阳升起，看得清清楚楚，还看见太阳外面的景象。他们朝东边看，只见太阳后面有一列山脉。山很高很高，他们不是望不到山顶就是忘了。谁也不记得看到那个方向有天空。那山脉一定确实就在这世界的外面。因为任何山峰，即使只及那山的几十分之一那么高，山上也应当有冰雪。但这些山尽管看上去高，却是暖洋洋、绿油油，到处是森林和瀑布。突然间，东方吹来一阵微风，把浪峰吹成泡沫状，把他们周围平滑的水面吹皱。这只有一眨眼工夫，可是这三个孩子对那一眨眼工夫却终身不忘。这阵风带来了一股香味和一种声音，是一阵音乐的声音。事后爱德蒙和尤斯塔斯都对此事绝口不谈。露茜只说得出，“真叫你心都碎了。”“啊呀，”我说，“真那么难过吗？”“难过？不。”露茜说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not even try to stop dim, for everything now felt as if it had been fated or had happened before. They helped him to lower his little coracle. Then he took off his sword ("I shall need it no more," he said) and flung it far away across the Idled sea. Where it fell it stood upright with the hilt above the surface. Then he bade them goodbye trying to be sad for their sakes but he was quivering with happiness. Lucy, for the first and last time, did what she had always wanted to do, taking him in her arms and caressing him. Then hastily he got into his coracle and took his paddle, and the current caught it and away he went, very black against the lilies. But no lilies grew on the wave; it was a smooth green slope. The coracle went more and more quickly, and beautifully it rushed up the wave's side. For one split second they saw its shape and Reepicheep's on the very top. Then it vanished, and since that moment no one can truly claim to have seen Reepicheep the Mouse. But my belief is that he came safe to Aslan's country and is alive there to this day.</div>

The water was warm and all the time it got shallower.
