<div class="line_en">Jack had found a huge white-painted wicker chair in the back of the equipment shed two weeks ago, and had dragged it around to the porch over Wendy's objections that it was really the ugliest thing she had ever seen in her whole life. He was sitting in it now, amusing himself with a copy of E. L. Doctorow's Welcome to Hard Times, when his wife and son rattled up the driveway in the hotel truck.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy parked it in the turn-around, raced the engine sportily, and then turned it off. The truck's single taillight died. The engine rumbled grumpily with post-ignition and finally stopped. Jack got out of his chair and ambled down to meet them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪找了个宽敞的地方把车停下，让引擎忽快忽慢地转了几下，然后熄了火。卡车仅有的一个尾灯灭了。引擎熄火后还哼哼了几声，终于安静下来。杰克站起身来，迈着从容的步子下去接他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very good. Danny complains that I keep jerking him but I didn't stall the truck once and… oh, Jack, you finished it!" She was looking at the roof, and Danny followed her gaze. A faint frown touched his face as he looked at the wide swatch of fresh shingles atop the Overlook's west wing, a lighter green than the rest of the roof. Then he looked down at the box in his hand and his face cleared again. At night the pictures Tony had showed him came back to haunt in all their original clarity, but in sunny daylight they were easier to disregard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还不错。丹尼抱怨我老是搡着他，但我一次也没熄火…呀，杰克，你把活儿干完了！”温迪望着屋顶，丹尼也跟着她看去。当他看到饭店西侧屋顶上那一大片绿色的新木瓦时，脸色微微沉了下来，然后，他低头看着手中的盒子，脸色又晴朗了。晚上，托尼给他看的那些画面总是来回纠缠不休，历历在目，清晰如初，但是在阳光照耀的白天，很容易就可以将它们暂弃不管。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The VW had a sunroof, and poking up through it, clawed hands on the wheel down below, was a gigantic warty monster with popping bloodshot eyes, a maniacal grin, and a gigantic English racing cap turned around backward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车顶的活动天窗伸出一个面目狰狞的妖怪，它身躯庞大，一双爪子拖在车轮上，血红的眼睛向外鼓出，咧嘴狂笑着，一顶巨大的英式赛车帽反扣在头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack took the box from his son. It was a model car, one of the Big Daddy Roth caricatures that Danny had expressed an admiration for in the past. This one was the Violent Violet Volkswagen, and the picture on the box showed a huge purple VW` with long '59 Cadillac Coupe de Ville taillights burning up a dirt track.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克从儿子手中接过盒子。这是一辆丹尼向往已久的模型汽车，是仿照大众车做的。盒子上的图案是一辆巨大的紫色大众车，长长的尾灯照在一条煤渣跑道上。">查看中文翻译</div>
