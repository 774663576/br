<div class="line_en">In that year Gant passed his fiftieth birthday: he knew he was half as old as the century that had died, and that men do not often live as long as centuries. And in that year, too, Eliza, big with the last child she would ever have, went over the final hedge of terror and desperation and, in the opulent darkness of the summer night, as she lay flat in her bed with her hands upon her swollen belly, she began to design her life for the years when she would cease to be a mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那一年里，甘特过了他50周岁的生日。他知道，他和这个世纪一样，都已经走过了50个春秋了。而一般情况下，人的寿命是过不了一个世纪的。也就在这一年里，伊丽莎怀上了她这一辈子的最后一个孩子，经历了自己最后的恐惧与绝望。在一个植物繁茂、漆黑的夏夜，她平躺在床上，双手抚摸着隆起的大肚子，开始为以后她不再当妈妈的生活设计起蓝图来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the great processional of the years through which the history of the Gants was evolving, few years had borne a heavier weight of pain, terror, and wretchedness, and none was destined to bring with it more conclusive events than that year which marked the beginning of the twentieth century. For Gant and his wife, the year 1900, in which one day they found themselves, after growing to maturity in another century -- a transition which must have given, wherever it has happened, a brief but poignant loneliness to thousands of imaginative people -- had coincidences, too striking to be unnoticed, with other boundaries in their lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the already opening gulf on whose separate shores their lives were founded, she was beginning to look, with the infinite composure, the tremendous patience which waits through half a lifetime for an event, not so much with certain foresight, as with a prophetic, brooding instinct. This quality, this almost Buddhistic complacency which, rooted in the fundamental structure of her life, she could neither suppress nor conceal, was the quality he could least understand, that infuriated him most. He was fifty: he had a tragic consciousness of time -- he saw the passionate fulness of his life upon the wane, and he cast about him like a senseless and infuriate beast. She had perhaps a greater reason for quietude than he, for she had come on from the cruel openings of her life, through disease, physical weakness, poverty, the constant imminence of death and misery: she had lost her first child, and brought the others safely through each succeeding plague; and now, at forty-two, her last child stirring in her womb, she had a conviction, enforced by her Scotch superstition, and the blind vanity of her family, which saw extinction for others but not for itself, that she was being shaped to a purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们夫妇之间早就隔了一道与生俱来的鸿沟，各自沿着自己的轨迹前进。她开始展望未来，带着无限的安详和极大的耐心。她并不指望能预见到什么，而是以一种沉思的本能希望美好的未来生活。她这种佛教徒般的安闲淡定是由她的生活结构所决定的，是她无法压抑，也难以掩盖住的。对此，奥利弗却难以理解，也无法容忍。他已经是个50岁的人了，对时间有一种悲观的认识——他感到自己激情四射、充实丰富的生活开始慢慢地消逝，变得越来越像一头麻木、暴怒的狮子。也许她比他更心安理得，更沉得住气，因为她从小就经历了严酷的生活，经历了疾病、穷困、无助、死亡与不幸的磨炼和威胁。她的头胎孩子虽然夭折了，但是她却能让其余的孩子经受住瘟疫的考验，安全活了下来。到现在，在她42岁的时候，她最后的一个孩子正在腹中不停地躁动。于是她便产生了一种坚定的信念，凭着苏格兰人的迷信，以及她们家族世代相传的盲目好胜心理——这个家族常常只看到别人的没落，从来看不到自己的衰败。她深信，自己在这一刻已经有了明确的人生目标。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As she lay in her bed, a great star burned across her vision in the western quarter of the sky; she fancied it was climbing heaven slowly. And although she could not have said toward what pinnacle her life was moving, she saw in the future freedom that she had never known, possession and power and wealth, the desire for which was mixed inextinguishably with the current of her blood. Thinking of this in the dark, she pursed her lips with thoughtful satisfaction, unhumorously seeing herself at work in the carnival, taking away quite easily from the hands of folly what it had never known how to keep.</div>

<div class="line_en">And lying there while the winds of early autumn swept down from the Southern hills, filling the black air with dropping leaves, and making, in intermittent rushes, a remote sad thunder in great trees, she thought of the stranger who had come to live in her, and of that other stranger, author of so much woe, who had lived with her for almost twenty years. And thinking of Gant, she felt again an inchoate aching wonder, recalling the savage strife between them, and the great submerged struggle beneath, founded upon the hatred and the love of property, in which she did not doubt of her victory, but which baffled her, foiled her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她躺在床上，初秋的风从南边的山上刮了过来，在黑夜里把枝头的树叶吹得漫空飞舞，不断发出哗哗的声音，从远处森林里传来阵阵悲哀的雷鸣声。这时候，她想起了生活在自己体内的陌生者，想起了同她生活了20年、令她饱尝痛苦的另一个陌生者。一想起甘特，原先那种莫名的痛苦再次浮现出来，她也想起了二人之间粗暴的斗争，以及表面上看不见的冲突。这一切都来自二人对产业不同的爱与恨。她坚信自己将是胜利者，但是何必要这样争呢，这个问题一直使她感到困惑和沮丧。">查看中文翻译</div>

If I'd been there, you can bet your bottom dollar there'd been no loss. Or, it'd be on the other side," she added grimly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gant, faced with the loss of sensuous delight, knowing the time had come when all his Rabelaisian excess in eating, drinking, and loving must come under the halter, knew of no gain that could compensate him for the loss of libertinism; he felt, too, the sharp ache of regret, feeling that he had possessed powers, had wasted chances, such as his partnership with Will Pentland, that might have given him position and wealth. He knew that the century had gone in which the best part of his life had passed; he felt, more than ever, the strangeness and loneliness of our little adventure upon the earth: he thought of his childhood on the Dutch farm, the Baltimore days, the aimless drift down the continent, the appalling fixation of his whole life upon a series of accidents. The enormous tragedy of accident hung like a gray cloud over his life. He saw more clearly than ever that he was a stranger in a strange land among people who would always be alien to him. Strangest of all, he thought, was this union, by which he had begotten children, created a life dependent on him, with a woman so remote from all he understood.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not know whether the year 1900 marked for him a beginning or an ending; but with the familiar weakness of the sensualist, he resolved to make it an ending, burning the spent fire in him down to a guttering flame. In the first half of the month of January, still penitently true to the New Year's reformation, he begot a child: by Spring, when it was evident that Eliza was again pregnant, he had hurled himself into an orgy to which even a notable four months' drunk in 1896 could offer no precedent. Day after day he became maniacally drunk, until he fixed himself in a state of constant insanity: in May she sent him off again to a sanitarium at Piedmont to take the "cure," which consisted simply in feeding him plainly and cheaply, and keeping him away from alcohol for six weeks, a regime which contributed no more ravenously to his hunger than it did to his thirst. He returned, outwardly chastened, but inwardly a raging furnace, toward the end of June: the day before he came back, Eliza, obviously big with child, her white face compactly set, walked sturdily into each of the town's fourteen saloons, calling up the proprietor or the bar-man behind his counter, and speaking clearly and loudly in the sodden company of bar clientry:</div>

<div class="line_en">All through the summer Eliza walked with white boding placidity through horror -- she had by now the hunger for it, waiting with terrible quiet the return of fear at night. Angered by her pregnancy, Gant went almost daily to Elizabeth's house in Eagle Crescent, whence he was delivered nightly by a band of exhausted and terrified prostitutes into the care of his son Steve, his oldest child, by now pertly free with nearly all the women in the district, who fondled him with good-natured vulgarity, laughed heartily at his glib innuendoes, and suffered him, even, to slap them smartly on their rumps, making for him roughly as he skipped nimbly away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个夏天，伊丽莎一天到晚都是脸色惨白、心惊胆战——到现在，她已经习惯了这种生活，每天都在静待着晚上恐怖的降临。甘特对伊丽莎的怀孕极其恼火，他几乎每天都要到鹰环附近的伊丽莎白妓院去泡妞。到了晚上，总会被一帮精疲力竭、惊恐不已的妓女们送到他大儿子史蒂夫那儿，由他护送回家。这样日子长了，史蒂夫也就对这帮妓女举止随便起来。这些女人善意地和他搂搂抱抱，听他说一些油腔滑调的下流话，然后一笑了之。有时候她们还情愿让他在屁股上打上火辣辣的一巴掌，然后急忙去追他，而这时他却轻快地溜掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boy was usually accompanied on these errands by Jannadeau and Tom Flack, a negro hack-man, who waited in patient constraint outside the latticed door of the brothel until the advancing tumult within announced that Gant had been enticed to depart. And he would go, either struggling clumsily and screaming eloquent abuse at his suppliant captors, or jovially acquiescent, bellowing a wanton song of his youth along the latticed crescent, and through the supper-silent highways of the town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通常和史蒂夫一起接送甘特的还有简那度以及另一位黑人车夫，他的名叫汤姆·佛莱克。他们二人都会耐心地等在妓院的格状门外面，一旦听到里面的喧闹声离他们越来越近时，他们就知道甘特已经在准备离开了。他离开的时候要么摇摇晃晃地向前摸索着，要么大声地咒骂那帮妓女，要么就是沿着妓院的格状门，快活地走进空荡荡的大街。这时候正是吃晚饭的时候，他边走边扯开嗓子唱一首自己年轻时学会的小调：">查看中文翻译</div>

But he's a nice old boy when he wants to be," she continued, kissing the bald spot on his head, and deftly slipping into the boy's hand the wallet Gant had, in a torrent of generosity, given to her. She was scrupulously honest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子，”伊丽莎一边用力摇着甘特的脑袋，一边对史蒂夫说，“你长大以后可不要再这样下去啊。不要像这个老头子那样胡搞。他要是安分守己，倒还是个好孩子。”她边说话边在甘特秃亮的头顶上亲了一口，然后熟练地把刚才甘特在醉意中交给她的钱包塞进了史蒂夫的手中。她倒是有点诚实过度了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不对，上帝做证，”甘特反唇相讥，“他硬是把她给饿死了。如果老夫人这辈子曾经吃过一顿饱饭的话，那也是在我家里吃的。只有一件事可以肯定：要是她上地狱里走一遭，再走回来，她也不可能从老彭特兰那儿或者从她儿子那儿吃到一顿像样的饭的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nobody knows -- nobody knows," she began, bursting quickly into a rapid flow of tears, "what I've been through." She wiped her eyes in a moment on a corner of the coverlid: her broad powerful nose, founded redly on her white face, was like flame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有人知道，没有人知道哪，”她刚一说话，眼泪便像泉水似的汩汩而出，“我过的这算是什么日子啊。”她用被角轻轻地擦拭着眼泪。过了一会儿，她白净面庞上宽大结实的鼻子被擦得通红，像一团火焰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do you feel, Eliza?" The room was heavy with the rich odor of mellowing pears; an unaccustomed fire of pine sticks burned in the grate: he took up his place before it, and began to pare his nails.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll vow, Will," she said quietly after a moment. "I've had all I can put up with. I don't know what's got into him.

<div class="line_en">The child sat in the big chair by the waning sitting-room fire: she read until the flames had died to coals -- then quietly she shovelled ashes on them. Gant, fathoms deep in slumber, lay on the smooth leather sofa against the wall. She had wrapped him well in a blanket; now she put a pillow on a chair and placed his feet on it. He was rank with whisky stench; the window rattled as he snored.</div>
