<div class="line_en">"Have you been here before?" Dylan asked as he pointed the way to the old woman's house, where a light shone brightly from the one window. It was much darker here, and the warm glow was welcoming.</div>

<div class="line_en">She lived in a wooden building that Dylan could only describe as a shack, surrounded by miles and miles of flat plains. It was an isolated and wild place, with yapping dogs and rolling thunderclouds overhead, though whatever rain lurked amongst the steel grey stayed in the sky. Eliza. The oldest soul that Jonas knew. If anyone was going to be able to give her answers, he told Dylan, it was Eliza</div>

<div class="line_en">Jonas had taken her there simply by walking through another of the doors on his street. One moment they had been surrounded by buildings, the next, sand and tumbleweed. Dylan watched him close a rickety gate, warped pieces of wood held together with rusting nails.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔纳斯只消穿过那条街上另外一扇门，就把迪伦带到了伊莱扎的住处。刚才还建筑物林立的地方，眼下已经变成了遍布漫漫黄沙、无根蓬草的野外。迪伦看着他靠近一扇摇摇欲坠的大门，门上那几块烂木板已经翘了起来，全靠生锈的钉子勉强维系着才没有四分五裂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave her a funny look and Dylan knew that he was hoping Eliza would try to talk her out of it rather than help her. She looked at the ramshackle house, a little nervous.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan set her mouth into a dissatisfied line. That didn't really answer her question, but she sensed it was all Jonas knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦有些不满意地撇了撇嘴。他根本没有回答自己的问题，但她觉得乔纳斯知道的也就这么多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's been here a very long time," Jonas replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她在这里已经很久了。”乔纳斯回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jonas stepped smartly onto a shaky-looking wooden porch and rapped on the door, but Dylan held back. Though she had confronted Jonas without any hesitation, she felt unsure, timid at the thought of speaking to another soul. Maybe it was because she was old, a proper adult. Maybe it was because she had never known Tristan. Whatever it was, it had Dylan backing away rather than stepping forward. If Jonas hadn't escorted her, she knew she wouldn't even have made it this far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔纳斯脚步轻快地走到看起来随时可能坍塌的木门廊上，轻敲房门。迪伦此时有些踌躇。尽管她面对乔纳斯时没有丝毫的犹疑，但是一想到要和另外一个陌生的灵魂说话，她还是感到惶恐不安，心生怯意。也许是因为伊莱扎的年纪，已经完完全全是成年人了。也许是因为她根本不认识崔斯坦。无论是什么原因，总之迪伦的脚步是往回缩，而不是往前进。她知道如果不是有乔纳斯的陪同，自己不可能走到现在这一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who is she?" Dylan asked. "How does she know about these things?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是什么人？”迪伦问，“她怎么会知道这些事情的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside, the cabin was a little cosier, and that eased some of her nerves. A fire burned, and the walls were adorned with knitted fabrics. It was a one-room hut, with the bed against the wall at one end, and a small kitchen area underneath the window at the other. In the middle sat an ancient woman, swaddled in blankets and rocking gently in an old-fashioned wooden rocking chair. Dylan continued to look around rather than return her curious stare, and wondered idly if this was what the wasteland safe houses had looked like before they'd fallen into disrepair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小屋里温暖舒适的感觉多少冲淡了她的紧张感。炉火正旺，墙上装饰着手工编织物。这是间一居室的小屋，一头的墙角靠着张床，另一头墙壁的窗下是下厨的地方。在屋子中间坐着一位上了岁数的老妇人，她全身裹着毯子，坐在一把老式木摇椅上轻轻摇晃着。迪伦好奇地四处张望，心里漫无目的地想着，这个小屋莫不就是荒原上的安全屋在年久失修之前的样子？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought about changing her mind, telling Jonas not to bother. Tristan seemed even further away in this alien, unforgiving landscape. But then a voice from inside called "Come", and Jonas swung the door open, motioning with his hand for her to enter. There was nothing Dylan could do but comply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想改变主意，告诉乔纳斯不必麻烦了。在这片无情的异域，崔斯坦似乎已经渐行渐远了。然而内心深处却有一个声音在喊着：“来吧。”乔纳斯推开了门，向她做出请进的手势。除了随遇而安，迪伦别无他法了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“伊莱扎，这是迪伦，她想—”乔纳斯开了口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan frowned. She didn't want to sit down. She was agitated, pent up. She wanted to pace, to move about and release some of the tension making her muscles twitch. She wanted to find out what the old woman knew and then get going, get started.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦皱了皱眉，她不想坐下。她焦躁不安，郁气中结。她想要不停踱步，好把自己肌肉抽痛的压力释放出一部分。她想搞明白这个老妇人到底了解些什么，然后就单刀直入，马上开始正题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How did you…" Dylan tailed off under the shrewd look Eliza gave her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么……”迪伦后半截话在伊莱扎的目光中硬生生地咽了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"People always come to me when they want to know that. I have seen a hundred others like you, my dear," she said, not unkindly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人们想要知道那个的话总会来我这里。我已经见过成百个像你一样的了，亲爱的。”她温和地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You want to know how to go back," she finished for him, her voice feathery and weak, but when Dylan whipped her head round to gape at her -- surprised that she had been so quick to guess the reason for her visit -- her eyes were alert, piercing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想知道怎样才能回去是吗？”她替乔纳斯说完了剩下的话。她的声音听上去轻飘飘的无比虚弱。迪伦惊诧于她竟能立刻猜中自己此行的目的，不禁急忙转头目瞪口呆地看着她，这才发现她双目如炬，目光敏锐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can you tell me how to do it?" Dylan asked, the fingers of her left hand crossing behind her back.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, they wouldn't," Eliza contradicted gently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，他们不会的。”伊莱扎温和地反驳说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's this place," Dylan whispered. "It's like a prison; it won't let you out. I know," she continued, seeing Eliza shake her head, "most people don't want to leave. But it should let them, if they want to."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're wrong," Eliza said. "It's not this place. It's the souls; they stop themselves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你错了。”伊莱扎说，“不是这个地方不让他们走，而是这些灵魂自己束缚住了自己。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Eliza repeated. "Because when most people try to open that door -- and you're right, many do try -- every time they try to open the door, it locks itself."</div>

<div class="line_en">"They don't really want to leave. No, that's not quite right. They want to leave, but more than that they don't want to die. Somewhere deep down, they know crossing the wasteland again will likely be the death of them, and that thought stops them, keeps them here. Because they know if they're patient, if they wait, they'll likely see their loved ones again. They just can't take the risk of trying, and failing; knowing that will truly be the end."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不是真的想离开。不，这样说也不对。他们是想离开，但他们更怕死。在他们的内心深处，他们知道再次穿越荒原很可能会死。一想到这些，他们就只能老实地待在这里。因为他们知道如果耐心足够的话，如果等待的话，他们就会再次见到自己心爱的人。他们只是不敢冒失败的风险，因为那有可能是自寻死路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan considered that. Did she? She thought so. And from the sound of it, it would be nothing to try the door and find out. But even if she got back to the wasteland, then what? How would she find Tristan? She doubted Eliza would be able to tell her that. Had there ever been a soul who wanted to be reunited with their ferryman? Dylan didn't care if she and Tristan came here, or if they went back to the real world. Even if they lived in the wasteland. She shuddered at the thought of the wraiths, of facing them again, but she would do it. She just wanted… she just wanted Tristan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦认真思索着，真的要这样做吗？是的。听她话的意思，打开门出去应该是毫不费力的事。可是如果她重新返回荒原，接下来又怎么办呢？她怎样才能找到崔斯坦呢？她觉得伊莱扎也不可能知道。曾有其他灵魂也像她一样盼望和自己的摆渡人重聚吗？无论是和崔斯坦一起留在这儿还是回到现实世界，迪伦都不在乎，哪怕他们一起生活在荒原也无所谓。虽然想到那些恶魔，想到要再次面对它们，她忍不住打了一个寒战，但她还是要回去。她只是要……她只是要和崔斯坦在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

She thought about the blood-red ground, the scorched sky, but even these terrifying images couldn't sway her. Her determination was solidifying. She was going to try it, she knew. Somehow she was going to make the door open, and she was going to try it. She was going to find Tristan. She smiled a tiny smile to herself, pleased with her decision. Looking up, she saw Eliza watching her closely.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she remembered. Remembered watching shadowy outlines ghosting across the red-tinged wasteland. Remembered the hoard of black wraiths dogging their every step. And the orbs. The glowing orbs lighting the path, giving the souls something to follow, keeping them safe. Would that be all Tristan was to her now, an orb? If so, how would she tell him apart from the thousand others? You'll know, a small voice said at the back of her head. But just once. Just quietly. Because the rest of her conscious brain turned the full force of its scorn onto the voice. This wasn't some drippy, romantic movie. This was real life. If Tristan was one of those things, if she couldn't see him, hear him, she'd never pick him out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来她陷入回忆，想起了自己曾经看到的那些朦朦胧胧的轮廓幽幽穿过红色的荒原。想起了那一群黑压压、亦步亦趋地跟着他们的恶魔，还有那些光球。那些光球照亮了道路，指引灵魂们前行，保护他们的安全。现在的崔斯坦对她来说莫非就是这个样子，一个光球？如果是这样的话，她又怎么能从上千个摆渡人中把他认出来呢？一个微小的声音从潜意识中传来 —— “你会认出来的”。但这声音只响了一次，而且很微弱。因为她大脑剩余的清醒部分对这个声音嗤之以鼻，这可不是什么愚蠢而浪漫的爱情戏，这是活生生的现实。如果崔斯坦真的在那些光球之中的话，如果她无法看到他、听到他的声音，就永远无法把他找出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“光。”伊莱扎替她把话说了。迪伦点点头，这个描述最恰当，“但是，”她继续说道，“他仍然是你的摆渡人。即使他曾经指引过其他灵魂，哪怕他已经指引了上千个灵魂。如果你遇到他的话，你还是应该能发现他，就像以前一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan sat motionless on the rickety safe-house chair, watching the woman sleep. Though she was well into adulthood -- she had celebrated her thirty-sixth birthday just a month before -- she looked very young curled up on the narrow single bed. Her long brown hair snaked around her shoulders, the short tendrils of her fringe tickling her eyebrows. Beneath the pale lilac of her eyelids, he could see her eyes flickering from side to side, watching dreams. There wasn't space in his clouded brain to wonder what she saw; he was simply glad that her eyes were closed. When they were open, when they were looking at him, they were exactly the right and exactly the wrong shade of green, and he couldn't stand to look back.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sighed and stood up from the chair, stretched, then wandered over to the window. It was dark outside, but that was no problem for him. It was easy to pick out the swirling shapes, shadows upon shadows, that coiled around the tiny building, sniffing, savouring. Waiting. They were frustrated. They hadn't caught so much as a whiff of the soul he was guiding. Not today, or the day before that, or the day before that. In fact, this was the easiest crossing he'd made in a long, long time. He smiled grimly to himself as he thought how much Dylan would have preferred the flat streets of this desolate urban decay. She wouldn't have been perturbed by the abandoned high-rises that had the woman craning her neck every three seconds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他叹口气，离开椅子站了起来，伸展了一下身体，然后踱到窗边。外面一片漆黑，但这对他来说毫无妨碍，他很快就发现了小屋周围那些黑压压飞旋的魔影，它们用力嗅着、回味着、等待着。它们在他这里又无功而返了，连这个灵魂的味都还没怎么闻到。不仅今天如此，昨天、前天都是如此。实际上，这是他长时间以来最轻松的一次任务。他想，要是迪伦还在的话，她会不会更喜欢现在衰落荒凉的城市和宽阔的大街呢？崔斯坦冷冷地笑了笑。那些废弃的大厦让眼前这个女人每隔三秒就伸长脖子张望一番，要是迪伦的话可能不会被这些高层建筑搅得心神不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He always thought of her that way, as 'the woman'. He didn't want to think her name. She was a job to him; not a person, although she was mild-mannered and cheerful. Her sunny disposition filled the air with warmth and kept the sky shining blue. She was meek, too, swallowing the lies he told her without question. Each night they had reached the safe house with plenty of time to spare. It was just as well, because Tristan's mind was not in the game.</div>

<div class="line_en">Blank. That's all he could manage. Blank and emotionless. Thoughtless. If he'd been concentrating, he might have felt sorry for the woman.

She deserved his pity, but he was too busy feeling sorry for himself and he had none to spare.</div>

<div class="line_en">A noise from behind made him whip his head round, but he relaxed almost before he'd completed the movement. It was just her, coughing quietly as she shifted on the mattress.

<div class="line_cn" title="这时崔斯坦身后突然传来一声响动，他急忙转头张望，不过很快他就发现是虚惊一场。原来是她在床垫上翻身时的低声咳嗽。崔斯坦有些忧心地仔细观察了她一会儿，好在她并没有醒。他觉得自己实在无法和她交谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gazing into the night wasn't enough of a distraction.

<div class="line_en">That gave Tristan a long time to kill. Six hours he'd been sitting here alone, and he'd managed not to think of her. He allowed himself a wry smile. That was a record. It was also as long as he was going to manage. Closing his eyes, he sifted through memories until he found the one he was looking for. Eyes the same shade of green as the soul sleeping soundly beside him, but a different face. Tristan's smile widened as he let himself get as close as he could to dreaming.</div>
