<div class="line_en">"Don't believe that," said Fagin. "When a man's his own enemy, it's only because he's too much his own friend; not because he's careful for everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain't such a thing in nature."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在一个像我们这样的小团体里边，我亲爱的，”费金感到有必要对这种观点作一个说明，“我们有一个笼统的一号，就是说，你不能把自己当成一号来考虑，要想一想我，加上所有其他的年轻人也是。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么是绞架？”费金继续说道，“绞架，我亲爱的，是一块丑恶的路标，它那个急转直下的箭头断送了多少好汉的远大前程。始终走在平路上，远远地避开绞架，这就是你的一号目的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first -- that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无非是让你明白我的意思，”老犹太扬起眉梢，说道，“要做到这一点，你必须依靠我，要把我的这份小买卖做得顺顺当当，就要靠你了。首先是你这个一号，其次才是我这个一号。你越是看重你这个一号，就越要关心我。说来说去，我们还是回到我开初跟你说的那句话了――以一号为重，我们大家才能抱成一团，我们必须这样做，否则只有各奔东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter's respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金先生高兴地看到，这样赞美他的才能，绝不是一般的恭维话，自己确实已经在这个新徒弟心中留下了足智多谋的印象，在两人交往之初就建立这种印象是至关紧要的。为了加深这个必要而又有用的印象，他趁热打铁，将业务的规模、范畴相当详尽地介绍了一番，把事实与虚构揉和在一起，尽量使之适合自己的用意。他将二者运用得非常娴熟，波尔特先生的敬意显然有所增强，同时又带有一点有益的畏惧，唤起这种畏惧是非常理想的。">查看中文翻译</div>

"If they don't get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's a case of lagging.

He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,-- his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many to have him back. You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”费金答道，“不太严重，控告他企图扒窃钱包。他们在他身上搜出一个银质鼻烟盒――是他自己的，亲爱的，是他自个的，他自个吸鼻烟，很喜欢吸。他们要把他关押到今天，认为他们知道东西是谁的。啊！他值得上五十个鼻烟盒，我愿意出那个价把他赎回来。可惜你没见过机灵鬼，亲爱的，可惜你没见过机灵鬼。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To think of Jack Dawkins -- lummy Jack -- the Dodger -- the Artful Dodger -- going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!

<div class="line_cn" title="费金正打算把这两个神秘的词语翻译成通俗的语言，这样经过解释，波尔特先生就可以明白了，两个词合在一起的意思是“终身流放”。就在这时，贝兹少爷突然走了进来，打断了他俩的谈话，贝兹两手插在裤兜里，扭歪了脸，那副愁眉苦脸的样子反倒让人觉得有些滑稽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin's directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand. He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip. Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection.</div>

<div class="line_en">Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman "Take that baby out," when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother's shawl, from some meagre infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock -- the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inamimate object that frowned upon it.</div>

For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the lid. This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.
