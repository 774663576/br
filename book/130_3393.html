<div class="line_en">The next morning, bright and early, I set out for the village where I had lived for some eighteen months. To either side of the road, people were cultivating in the fields and ran out to greet me. It was only with great difficulty that I avoided offers of millet beer, rotted manioc and smoked meat. By the time I reached the village, my pockets were full of eggs, bestowed upon me by Dowayos. I walked gingerly, knowing that many of them would be rotten.</div>

<div class="line_en">I crossed the public circle and noted with surprise that the ground bore signs that the cattle had been driven into the stone enclosure at night, not simply allowed to wander promiscuously in the bush.

<div class="line_en">It was a moot point whether or not I had the right to enter the chief's compound uninvited. I did, after all, have a hut in there. Deciding to err rather on the side of politeness than familiarity, I stood at the gatehouse clapping loudly -- the normal practice in much of Africa where there are no doors to knock on. There was no answer. Flies buzzed, goats belched, somewhere in the distance a woman was singing a grinding song accompanied by the dull rasp of stone on stone. Slipping somewhat from the standards of high formality, I called out asking whether anyone was there. Still there was no answer. Giving up all claims to decent behaviour, I pushed through the gate.</div>

<div class="line_en">He awoke with a start, greeted me and launched into a great description of the zeal and dedication with which he had guarded my hut in my absence. It was also, he confided, a good place to hide from the tax inspector. He had certainly made himself very much at home. The walls were covered with pictures torn from magazines depicting voluptuous ladies and large American cars. A spear lay in one corner. In the thatch were tucked little twists of cloth that doubtless contained ritually important objects such as cockerels' eggs and leopards' whiskers. Zuuldibo looked expectantly at my bag, doubtless able to detect the beer in it. I got out the two bottles. In a flash, he had whipped off the tops with the bottle-opener he carried always about his neck and sucked down a mouthful of foam with relish.</div>

<div class="line_en">The huts were all closed up, barricaded with grass mats against the incursion of dissolute goats, inquisitive little boys and -- doubtless -- errant anthropologists. Zuuldibo, the chief, had bought himself a fine new door made of a sheet of corrugated aluminium beaten flat. It sported a brand-new Taiwanese padlock. It was locked. Few places can look as desolate as an African village without people. Mentally, I typed my report to relevant grant-giving bodies: "The researcher visited the Dowayo people of North Cameroon to investigate their circumcision ceremony, but unfortunately they were out."</div>

<div class="line_en">Matthieu, it seemed, had been engaging in that traditional Dowayo game -- debt manipulation. In my time at the village, I had come to act very much as a banker to Zuuldibo who, like most Dowayos, was always pressed by claims for cash from relatives, taxmen, party officials, and so on. He would turn up at my hut, face averted with embarrassment -- to request me to lend him some small sum which would greatly ease his present difficulties. He would always hint at vast expectations. Since, at that time, I was living in one of the huts in his compound for which no charge was made, I was always glad to help out. Zuuldibo, for his part, would always punctiliously pay back at least half before he borrowed the same sum again. I suspect that this was a familiar traditional technique for muddying the accounts. So, by slow degrees. Zuuldibo had built up a considerable debt whose precise status was left indeterminate. Was it a loan, rent -- a gift? When I had returned to England, knowing that such a debt was hopelessly uncollectable, I had simply made the best of it by making a present of the whole sum to Zuuldibo in exchange for all his kindnesses to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">This, of course, was the act of a mere beginner in Dowayo social relations. I realize now that I should simply have let the debt ride, alluding to it occasionally to keep it fresh, as the mark of our relationship. There was something inherently insulting in my zeal to clear the matter up. Rather like completely paying one's bill at the village shop, it implied a determination to close the account and so terminate the relationship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dowayo circumcision is a protected process. As in many other parts of the world, the boy is depicted as being reborn with a new name and must be taught all the attributes of culture like a small child. It begins with the decoration of the boys by the husbands of their sisters. They roam the countryside dancing and being given food at any homestead. Once the heavy rains start, the boys can be cut. The operation is designed to be terrifying. The boys are stripped naked at the crossroads and led to the riverside grove where the cutting is to be performed. On the way they are leapt upon by the circumcisers who are growling like hunting leopards and threatening them with knives. The operation is very severe, the penis being peeled for its entire length. Several different circumcisers may each cut part of the foreskin off. The boy is not supposed to cry out but old men who told me about the festival admitted that many did. It did not really matter as long as the women thought they were brave. At the swimming-place, one sees the result of such operations. If the operation is performed young, the penis sometimes assumes an almost spherical form that must in part be responsible for the very low birthrate of the Dowayos. Since all were cut with the same knife and the risk of infection is very great, mortality was considerable. Boys who died from the operation were said to have been eaten by leopards. From the correspondence of French colonial officers, it is clear that they were distressed by the number of youths who were said to have been eaten by leopards -- although these were virtually extinct in the area. Dowayos, as a result, rapidly gained a reputation for engaging in lurid cannibalistic rites.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多瓦悠割礼仪式是个严密保护的过程。和世界许多文化一样受割礼的男孩被视为“更生”（reborn）（1），赐予新名，像小孩般学习所属文化的一切属性。多瓦悠割礼仪式一开始是由受割礼男孩的姊夫为他装饰身体，然后这些男孩在乡间四处游荡，所到之处的人家必须供给饮食。一旦大雨降下，男孩就可以接受割礼了。割礼过程的设计旨在造成恐怖效果。男孩在十字路口被剥得一丝不挂，带到河边的小树丛，在那里执行割礼。前往河边的途中，割礼人会跳出来，像豹子猎食般对他们咆哮，拿刀威胁。割礼非常残暴，整个阴茎都要割开来。数个割礼人，每人切下一点受割礼男孩的包皮。接受割礼的男孩不能哭，但是族里老人告诉我不少男孩都哭了。这不重要，只要女人误以为他们很勇敢即可。在多瓦悠人游泳处，你可看到割礼的成果。如果男孩年纪很小就受割礼，他的阴茎往往变成圆球状，这或许说明了该族生育率低落的原因。又因为割礼人重复使用同一把刀，感染几率极高，因之而死的男孩亦不少。多瓦悠人将这类死于割礼的男孩归诸为“被豹子吃掉了”。根据法国殖民官的信札，显然他们极沮丧有这么多男孩被豹子吃掉一虽然豹子在这个地区根本绝迹了。也因此，多瓦悠人恶名远播，传说他们举行可怕的食人仪式。【注：（1）JG。 Frazer在人类学著作《金枝》中说，一些部族在进行成年礼仪式时，是假装杀死已到青春期的孩子然后又使他复活，使其灵魂与祖灵相连。有时是假装受割礼的孩子被动物吞噬后再吐出。多瓦悠人行割礼时，割礼人假装豹子，或许也能做如此观。详见J.G。 Frazer：《金枝》，台北：久大、桂冠联合出版（1991年），第99l1002页。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boys who are circumcised must be secluded in the bush for some nine months -- the same period they spend in the womb. They must avoid women. Only at the end of this period could they wander about in the wicker and leaf covering such as those I had seen. Even now they were obliged to lay down leaves to form a "bridge" whenever they crossed over a path and to take up the polluted leaves afterwards. For freshly circumcised boys are very dangerous. They can make a pregnant woman miscarry and a young wife infertile. They must not talk to a woman directly but have little flutes with which they imitate the tone patterns of words so that they can "talk" with music.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only after the nine-month period may they return to the village, where they are fed, dressed and shown the hearths. Later they are taken to the house where the skulls of the male ancestors are kept and see them for the first time. They are now true men and may swear oaths on their knives. (Children who do so are beaten.) It was always odd to hear men calling out the shortened version of the oath to show great rage. It comes out as "Dang me!" Whenever I used the oath, this was felt to be highly comical.</div>

<div class="line_en">One might wonder why circumcision is so widespread in the world and why anthropologists are apparently so obsessed with it. It might be thought that deformation of the genitals will be so painful and unpleasant that these are the last things that people would want to mutilate. When one reads of some of the customary practices relating to the sexual organs it is hard to resist the view that such mutilations are inflicted because they are painful. Holes may be bored in the penis. It may be regularly slashed with glass to clean it. It may be sliced open to unfold like a flower when erect. Testes may be crushed or hacked off. Nothing it seems is excluded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家可能狐疑割礼为何普现于世界各地，人类学家又为何对割礼如此着迷。割礼是生殖器割损，理应十分痛苦与不悦，人们最不想做的事应当就是“自残”。但是如果你阅读有关性器的各种习俗，你很难不认为——性器割损之所以如此普遍，就是因为它很痛。有些地方的人会在阴茎打洞，定期用玻璃割开清洗。有些地方的人阴茎被整个划开，勃起时，好像一朵花绽放。有的地方则会捏碎或切除睾丸。真是无所不包。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anthropologists have continued to be fascinated by such practices as part of their awareness of the sheer "otherness" of alien peoples. If such practices can be "explained" and related to our own ways of living then that "otherness" has been removed and we feel we have got down to some more universal notion of what it means to be human. It would seem that if anthropological theories can cope with the sex customs, they can cope with anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">In my own researches with the Dowayos, although male circumcision was central to their culture, I found that they would quite happily combine several such approaches at the same time. They certainly did regard circumcision as the male equivalent of menstruation. A man will, for the rest of his life, be obliged to joke with men with whom he was cut -- his "brothers of circumcision" -- while a woman has to joke with the girls who began menstruating in the same year as herself -- her "sisters of menstruation".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男性割礼是多瓦悠文化的重心，根据我的研究，他们显然乐于同时融合数个“理论”。首先，他们的确将男性割礼视为类同女性排经（1）。男人终其一生都得与一起接受割礼的人——他的“割礼兄弟们”——维持戏谑关系（2）；而女人则和同一年初经来临的女性族人她的“月经姊妹们”——维持戏谑关系。【注：（1）心理分析学家 Bruno Bettelheim认为包皮割除、阴茎割裂是男性忌妒女性生殖力的象征表现。男性的阴茎割裂在象征上是要模仿经血与女性生殖器。（新几内亚北方窝吉欧岛的男人定期割裂阴茎使其流血，显然是在模仿月经。）详见 Roger Keesing，见前揭书，第718页。但是有关割礼的象征意义，人类学家说法不一，有人认为是象征牺牲、承受痛苦，有婚前则准备、象征生殖器神圣、警告不得滥交、卫生措施、象征去势，以及向神祇补偿生命之价值等，但没有一种说法被普遍接受。详见芮逸夫主编，《云五社会科学大辞典第十册一—人类学》，台北：商务印书馆（1971年），第231—232页。（2）戏谑关系是指一种存在于两个人（或两个团体）间的关系，按照习俗，一方可以向另一方戏谑掷掄，后者不得引以为忤。有时戏谑是相互的行为。戏谑的实际形式差异很大，但猥亵与取走财物是最平常的形式。此种关系是一种友情与敌意的混合，它常见于具有冲突可能性但必须极力避免的情况中。此种具有双重价值的关系，能够经由尊敬、回避或允许相互轻视、放纵而产生一种稳定的形式。也有人认为交相戏谑可排除敌意，最大功能在净化双方的情感。详见芮逸夫主编，前揭书，第304页。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One common "explanation" of the widespread removal of the foreskin is that it is regarded as in some way a female element that has no place on true men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="针对各民族广泛实施的割包皮，人类学最常见的解释为包皮是真正男人”不应有的女性元素。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other hand, the Dowayos clearly regarded the foreskin as in some way female, complaining that uncut boys were wet, smelly, "like women". The Dowayos are not greatly given to involved explanations of their customs. Normally they simply explain that they do things "because the ancestors told us to". But here they had a ready explanation forming an interesting parallel to the local American missionaries who also circumcised their young boys and explained with great sincerity that this was done as scientifically essential for health and well-being, the foreskin being a proved source of infection and uncleanness. While the Dowayos and the Americans were equally convinced of the necessity of genital mutilation of their young, the Dowayos disapproved of the American way of going about things -- firstly in that they hardly cut anything off their children and secondly that they did not keep them away from women immediately after cutting and so created a public-health danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，多瓦悠人显然也认为包皮某种程度是“女性”特质。他们抱怨未受割礼的男孩潮湿、发出臭气，像个“娘儿们”。在解释习俗方面，多瓦悠人天分不高，通常，他们将习俗归诸于“祖先要我们这么做”。不过针对割礼，他们的一个现成解释却正好与此间的美国传教士形成有趣对等。后者也让男孩割包皮，他们严肃解释：为了孩子的健康与福祉，此举是有科学依据的，因为包皮证明会导致感染且不洁。虽然多瓦悠人与美国人都深信割损年轻男孩的性器有其必要性，多瓦悠人却毫不苟同美国人割包皮的方法—一首先，他们只割那么一点点，有割等于没割；第二，男孩割完包皮后，没有马上与女人隔离，形成公共卫生的大害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Similar explanations have been devised to cope with the passion for excising the female clitoris -- this being viewed as a residual penis that has no place on women. Culture has here been required to straighten the seams of an imperfect nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同一理论也略加修正，用于解释割除女性阴蒂的狂热（2）——它被视为是阴茎的“残余物”，不应出现在女人身上。文化的任务是修正“不完美的自然”所留下的裂痕。【注：（2）割除女性阴核名为“女阴割礼”，全世界目前共有二十八个非洲伊斯兰教国家实施女阴割礼，每年共有两百万个四到十二岁的女孩接受女阴割礼。女阴割礼分为割损、切除与法老王割损三种。割损（suna）是切除阴蒂鞘皮尖切除（clitoridectomy）是切除整个阴蒂与部分小阴唇、阴道口；法老王割损ulation）是切除阴蒂、小阴唇、刮除大阴唇与阴道内壁的肉。详见玛丽林弗仑区，《对抗女人的战争》，台北：时报文化（1994年），第113—120页。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But if circumcision is regarded as being just one way of straightening the seams of biology, there is an absent element. I have already mentioned the possibility of female circumcision. This is much publicized these days, being presented as part of a wicked plot by males to dominate females and enslave them, and therefore a subject of hot debate. The much more common mutilation of males goes unremarked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是如果割礼被视为是更正“生理裂痕”的方法之一，那么它还少了一样。我前面提及女性割礼。这种习俗近来广受重视，被视为是男性宰制女性的邪恶计谋（1），激发热烈辩论。远比女阴割礼普遍的男性性器割损却遭到漠视（2）。【注：（1）部分文化认为女性如果保留阴蒂，会饱受情欲之苦。因此女阴割礼在这些文化里被视为是女性守贞的象征，未受过割礼的女孩，可能在及笄时乏人问津，因此很难扫除此种习俗，成为被女性主义学者抨击的“男性控制女性情欲”的手段。详见玛丽林·弗仑区，前揭书，第113—120页。（2）有人估计，全球约有七分之一的男性接受割礼。评见芮逸夫，前揭书，第232页。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We withdrew to the bush with great whispering and giggling. There, to the accompaniment of diagrams. I tried to explain the basic possibilities to a fascinated but sceptical audience. They shook their heads and pointed to the marks in the dust, amazed at the perversity of other peoples. "But does it not hurt?" they asked, as if unaware of the agonies inflicted on boys by their own practices. "Does it really stop women wandering about and committing adultery?" Little alternative remains in such situations to a shrug and a standard formula such as, "I do not know. I have not seen."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dowayos, however, do not mutilate female genitals. It is true that at the end of my second visit, I received a bizarre deputation of old men who had heard of such a practice and asked me to explain it to them. Once again the problem of ethics rears its head. Should the ethnographer allow himself to become involved in teaching about practices that many would regard with horror? To accept such constraints would make most of anthropology beyond the pale since most of its subject matter inspires dread in polite drawing-rooms.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, the mutilation of women was at least a theoretical possibility for Dowayos. But one problem remains. In females, breasts are functional and necessary to feed the young. In males they are not. Why, therefore, do men not cut off their nipples as an intrusive female element rather than remove their foreskins? I know of no documented example anywhere in the world. Imagine, therefore, my excitement when Matthieu remarked casually that the Ninga -- a neighbouring people -- were odd in that their men had no nipples. I sought to confirm this statement by questioning other Dowayo men. It took some effort to work the conversation round to the topic, but they agreed that this was indeed the case. An expedition in search of the missing mastectomy was clearly in order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，对多瓦悠人来说，女阴割礼是“理论上可行”的事了。但我的疑问仍未解决。女人的乳房有其功能性，哺育幼儿不可或缺，对男人而言，不是。因此，男人为什么不把自己的乳头视为“外来的女性元素”，将它们割掉，而是去割包皮？我读过的所有文献都不曾提及有哪个文化的男人割除乳头。因此当马修无意间提到邻近的部族尼加人（Ninga）真奇怪，他们的男人都没有乳头时，你可想见我有多兴奋。我向其他多瓦悠男人打探此一讯息真假，颇花了点时间绕圈子打转才踏入正题，他们都同意马修的说法。毫无疑问，我一定得展开旅程，寻找“失落的乳房切除术”。">查看中文翻译</div>
