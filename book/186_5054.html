<div class="line_en">Then their heads came out of the pool and, once more, the sunny quietness of the Wood between the Worlds was all about them, and it seemed richer and warmer and more peaceful than ever after the staleness and ruin of the place they had just left. I think that, if they had been given the chance, they would again have forgotten who they were and where they came from and would have lain down and enjoyed themselves, half asleep, listening to the growing of the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="脑袋一出水潭，他们便再次来到各个世界之间的树林，置身于阳光明媚的宁静之中。刚刚离开那个陈腐、荒芜的地方，这片树林似乎比以前更显得青翠、温暖和安详。我想，如果可能的话，他们又会忘记自己是谁，从哪儿来，然后躺下，聆听树木的生长，朦朦胧胧地享受快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But this time there was something that kept them as wide-awake as possible: for as soon as they had got out on to the grass, they found that they were not alone. The Queen, or the Witch (whichever you like to call her) had come up with them, holding on fast by Polly's hair. That was why Polly had been shouting out "Let go!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这次，他们不得不努力保持着清醒：因为一到草地上，他们就发现，不光是他们两人，那个女王，或女巫（不管你叫她什么），也跟着来了，仍然紧紧地抓住波莉的头发。怪不得刚才波莉大喊“放开！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This proved, by the way, another thing about the rings which Uncle Andrew hadn't told Digory because he didn't know it himself. In order to jump from world to world by one of those rings you don't need to be wearing or touching it yourself; it is enough if you are touching someone who is touching it. In that way they work like a magnet; and everyone knows that if you pick up a pin with a magnet, any other pin which is touching the first pin will come too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顺便说说，这也证明了戒指的另一种作用，安德鲁舅舅没有告诉迪格雷，他自己也不知道。要想靠那些戒指从一个世界到另一个世界，不需要戴上或亲手触摸戒指，只要触摸一个能触摸到戒指的人就行了。这很像磁铁。人人都知道，如果用一块磁铁拾一根别针，碰到这根别针的其他别针也会被吸起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that you saw her in the wood, Queen Jadis looked different. She was much paler than she had been; so pale that hardly any of her beauty was left. And she was stooped and seemed to be finding it hard to breathe, as if the air of that place stifled her. Neither of the children felt in the least afraid of her now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，树林中的简蒂丝女王完全变了。脸色比以前苍白得多，她的美貌几乎一点儿也不存在了。她好像呼吸困难似的弯卜腰去，那毕的空气仿佛使她感到窒息。两个孩子一点儿也不怕她了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They both turned and struggled with her. They were stronger than she and in a few seconds they had forced her to let go. She reeled back, panting, and there was a look of terror in her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人转过身，与她厮打起来。他们比她强壮，很快就迫使她松开了手。她喘着气，摇晃若向后退去，眼晴里露出恐惧的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a reason of State," said Polly spitefully. "Like when you killed all those people in your own world. Do be quick, Digory." They had put on their green rings, but Digory said:</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no doubt that the Witch had got over her faintness; and now that one saw her in our own world, with ordinary things around her, she fairly took one's breath away. In Charn she had been alarming enough: in London, she was terrifying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毫无疑问，女巫已经不再虚弱；眼下，她站在我们的世界里，和周围的普通事物一比，实在使人倒吸一口凉气。在恰恩，她曾经使人非常惊讶：在伦敦，她使人感到恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“幸好我们做了标记。”波莉想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But as they jumped Digory felt that a large cold finger and thumb had caught him by the ear. And as they sank down and the confused shapes of our own world began to appear, the grip of that finger and thumb grew stronger.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch was apparently recovering her strength. Digory struggled and kicked, but it was not of the least use. In a moment they found themselves in Uncle Andrew's study; and there was Uncle Andrew himself, staring at the wonderful creature that Digory had brought back from beyond the world. And well he might stare. Digory and Polly stared too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="豪无疑问，女巫的力量正在恢复，迪格雷又打又踢，但毫无用处。一会儿，他们便到了安德鲁舅舅的书房。安德色舅舅目瞪口呆地看着迪格雷从另一世界带回的奇妙动物。他这样呆望着是有理由的。迪格雷和波莉也目瞪口呆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For one thing, they had not realized till now how very big she was. "Hardly human" was what Digory thought when he looked at her; and he may have been right, for some say there is giantish blood in the royal family of Charn. But even her height was nothing compared with her beauty, her fierceness, and her wildness. She looked ten times more alive than most of the people one meets in London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，他们到现在也没弄清楚她到底有多么庞大。“简直不是人类。”迪格雷看着她这样想；他也许想得不错，因为有人说过，恰恩皇族有巨人血统。但她的高度，比起她的美貌、残忍和野性来要逊色一筹。她看上去比伦敦街上的大多数人都要多出十倍的精力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One good thing about seeing the two together was that you would never again be afraid of Uncle Andrew, any more than you'd be afraid of a worm after you had met a rattlesnake or afraid of a cow after you had met a mad bull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见这两个人站在一起有一种好处：你不会再怕安德公舅舅，犹如见过响尾蛇不再怕蚯蚓，见过发疯的公牛不再怕奶牛一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Andrew was bowing and rubbing his hands and looking, to tell the truth, extremely frightened. He seemed a little shrimp of a creature beside the Witch. And yet, as Polly said after wards, there was a sort of likeness between her face and his, something in the expression. It was the look that all wicked Magicians have, the "Mark" which Jadis had said she could not find in Digory's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安德鲁舅舅躬腰、搓手，看着她；说实话，他害怕极了。在女巫身边，他就像是虾米一样的小动物。而且，正如波莉后来说的，他和女巫的表情有某种相似之处；那是一种所有邪恶的魔法师都有的表情，即简蒂丝说她在迪格雷脸上找不到的“标记”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Andrew kept on rubbing his hands and bowing. He was trying to say something very polite, but his mouth had gone all dry so that he could not speak. His "experiment" with the rings, as he called it, was turning out more successful than he liked: for though he had dabbled in Magic for years he had always left all the dangers (as far as one can) to other people. Nothing at all like this had ever happened to him before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安德丢舅舅不断地搓手鞠躬。他想说几句客气话，但他口干得说不出来。他所谓的用戒指做的“实验”，结果比他盼望的还要成功：因为虽然他与魔法打了多年的交道，但他总是把危险留给他人。类似今天这样的事还从未发生过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Jadis spoke; not very loud, but there was something in her voice that made the whole room quiver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，简蒂丝开口了，声音不大，却使整个屋子战栗起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You?" said the Queen in a still more terrible voice. Then, in one stride, she crossed the room, seized a great handful of Uncle Andrew's grey hair and pulled his head back so that his face looked up into hers. Then she studied his face as she had studied Digory's face in the palace of Charn. He blinked and licked his lips nervously all the time. At last she let him go: so suddenly that he reeled back against the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你！”女王的声青越加可怕。说着，她一步跨进屋子，一把抓住安德鲁舅舅的灰发，将他的头朝后一拧，使他的脸对着自己。然后，她像在恰恩王宫早研究迪格雷的脸一样仔细研究他的脸。他很紧张，不停地眨眼睛、舔嘴唇。最后，她松开手，他一下往后倒去，摇摇晃晃地撞在墙上。">查看中文翻译</div>

When he reached his bedroom, which was the floor below, he locked himself in. And the very first thing he did was to grope in his wardrobe for a bottle and a wine-glass which he always kept hidden there where Aunt Letty could not find them. He poured himself out a glassful of some nasty, grown-up drink and drank it off at one gulp. Then he drew a deep breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们有必要回头讲讲安德鲁舅舅。他从阁楼上跌跌绊绊地跑下去时，那颗可怜的老心脏砰砰地乱跳。他用手帕在额头上不断地揩着。当他进到楼下的卧室里，便把自己锁在毕面。他做的第一件事就是从衣柜里摸出一个瓶子和一个酒杯，他总是把这些东西藏在柜子里，以免被蕾蒂姨妈发现。他给自己满斟了一杯味道刺鼻的大人喝的酒，一口气喝了下去，然后，长长地舒了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I see," said Polly in rather a different voice. "Alright. We'll call it Pax. I'll come back -- if I can. But I must go now." And she crawled through the little door into the tunnel; and that dark place among the rafters which had seemed so exciting and adventurous a few hours ago, seemed quite tame and homely now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，我明白了。”波莉声音异常地说，“好吧，这次行动代号‘和平女神’。我会回来的——如果回得来的话。但我现在必须走了。”她钻出小门，进了隧道椽子之间黑暗的地方几小时前还那么令人激动，那么富有冒险色彩，现在却似乎显得普通和平淡了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He poured out a second glass and drank it too; then he began to change his clothes. You have never seen such clothes, but I can remember them. He put on a very high, shiny, stiff collar of the sort that made you hold your chin up all the time. He put on a white waistcoat with a pattern on it and arranged his gold watch chain across the front. He put on his best frock-coat, the one he kept for weddings and funerals. He got out his best tall hat and polished it up. There was a vase of flowers (put there by Aunt Letty) on his dressing table; he took one and put it in his buttonhole. He took a clean handkerchief (a lovely one such as you couldn't buy today) out of the little lefthand drawer and put a few drops of scent on it. He took his eye-glass, with the thick black ribbon, and screwed it into his eye; then he looked at himself in the mirror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又倒了一杯喝下去后，他开始换衣服。你从未见过这样的衣服，但我还记得。他戴上一副硬邦邦的闪光的高领子，这种领子使你的下巴不得不长时间地昂着，又套上一件有图案的内背心，把金表链挂在前面。接着，他穿上婚丧仪式才用的最好的衣服，拿出最好的高筒礼帽拍打干净。他的梳妆桌上放着一瓶花（蕾蒂姨妈放的），他摘下一朵插在扣眼里，又从左边的小抽履里掏出一块手帕（很漂亮．现在难以买到），往上面洒了几滴香水。他将系着黑色粗绸带的眼镜戴上，然后，对着镜子观赏起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You see, the foolish old man was actually beginning to imagine the Witch would fall in love with him. The two drinks probably had something to do with it, and so had his best clothes. But he was, in any case, as vain as a peacock; that was why he had become a Magician.</div>

<div class="line_en">Children have one kind of silliness, as you know, and grown-ups have another kind. At this moment Uncle Andrew was beginning to be silly in a very grown-up way. Now that the Witch was no longer in the same room with him he was quickly forgetting how she had frightened him and thinking more and more of her wonderful beauty. He kept on saying to himself, "A dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman. A superb creature." He had also somehow managed to forget that it was the children who had got hold of this "superb creature": he felt as if he himself by his Magic had called her out of unknown worlds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你知道，孩子们有种傻气，大人有另一种傻气。这时，安德鲁舅舅开始犯大人的傻气了。女巫不在他的房里，他便很快忘了刚才受到的惊吓，开始对她的美貌想入非非。他不断自言自语，“一个漂亮的贵妇人，先生，一个漂亮的贵妇人，一个超级尤物”。他不知不觉地忘了那个“超级尤物”足孩子们找到的，他觉得是他自己用魔法从不可知的世界里召唤来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He unlocked the door, went downstairs, sent the housemaid out to fetch a hansom (everyone had lots of servants in those days) and looked into the drawingroom. There, as he expected, he found Aunt Letty. She was busily mending a mattress. It lay on the floor near the window and she was kneeling on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打开了门，走下楼，打发一个女佣去叫一辆双轮双座的马车（那年月，每个人都有许多仆人），然后朝客厅张望，他如愿以偿地在客斤里找到了蕾蒂姨妈，她正在修补一块垫子。垫子铺在窗户旁边，她跪在上面。">查看中文翻译</div>
