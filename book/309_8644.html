<div class="line_en">Her first thought was that the man must have been one of her sons, but he did not look like either of the brothers in the framed photos by the door. He seemed far too old, although it was difficult to tell. His face was dotted with whiskers and his eyes looked painful and loud. A bandaged hand fell out of his coat sleeve and cherries of blood were seeping through the wrapping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的第一反应是，这个男人应该是霍尔茨埃普费尔太太的儿子，可他跟门旁相框里的两兄弟都不像。他看起来老得多，但是也说不清到底有多少岁。他脸上点缀着稀疏的胡须，眼神中透着强烈的痛苦，外衣袖子下的胳膊绑着绷带，绷带上渗出樱桃大小的血迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He answered again, only louder, and now, he answered the question fully. "Stalingrad happened to my hand. I was shot in the ribs and I had three of my fingers blown off.

<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，他给出了更响亮、更完整的回答。“我的伤是在斯大林格勒受的。我肋部中了一枪，还被炸掉了三根手指。这样说你明白了没有？”他把没有受伤的手伸进口袋，在袭来的德国的寒风中不屑一顾地打冷战。“你觉得这儿冷吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="男人笑了。“这可算不得冷。”他从口袋里抽出一根烟塞进嘴里，试着单手擦亮火柴。天气这么糟糕，双手擦火柴都很困难了，一只手怎么可能擦得着呢？他扔掉火柴盒，骂了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I made my way through the fallen souls, one of the men was saying, "My stomach is itchy." He said it many times over. Despite his shock, he crawled up ahead, to a dark, disfigured figure who sat streaming on the ground. When the soldier with the wounded stomach arrived, he could see that it was Robert Holtzapfel.
