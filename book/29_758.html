<div class="line_en">It is usually he that picks up the phone. She will come up to him asking who the caller is. Knowing it's me, she will grab the phone, say a few greeting words, and then start talking bad of him, complaints flooding out, all about chores and minor superficial details.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quarreling seems to be bound with their life. He seems like a capricious boy, and she a little girl who cannot bear with even a small grievance. It is common that they fight each other half a day over minor issues. Over and over again, they will quarrel -- they are born to disagree with each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="争吵似乎成了他们生活中不可缺少的一部分。他看起来像个反复无常的孩子，而她像一个不能忍受丁点委屈的小女孩。他们经常为生活中的小问题吵上半天。他们一遍又一遍地争吵——好像生来就是意见不和的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I called them from Zhuhai, the beautiful city of relaxation and exciting views. I wanted to depict to them how pretty a city Zhuhai is. He was surprised that I had travelled such a great distance, to where he and she had never been all their life. He then believed that I had accomplished a big success, and that I had significantly broadened my horizons. He went on talk in honor of me, voice trembling with pride; she was beside him, excited all the same. They did not mention anything about the family change and their suffering.</div>
