<div class="line_en">I assumed the first time round that what was necessary was to show a grant-giving body why proposed research was interesting | new | important. Nothing could be further from the truth. When an inexperienced ethnographer pushes this aspect of his research, a grant-giving committee begins, perhaps on the basis of sound experience, to wonder how the research is standard | normal | a continuation of previous work. By stressing the vast theoretical implications of my little bit of research for the continued existence of anthropology, I was putting myself in the position of a man extolling the quality of the roast beef to a party of vegetarians. Everything I did made matters worse. In due time I received a letter telling me that the committee were concerned about the completion of the basic ethnography of the area, the brute collecting of facts. I rewrote my application in moronic detail. This time the committee were worried about the fact that I would be doing research on an unknown group. I rewrote; this time, they let it go. I received my funding. First hurdle down.</div>

<div class="line_en">The problem of permission to conduct research now became paramount, since time and money were leaking away. I had written to the relevant ministry in Cameroon about a year before and been promised an answer in due course. I wrote again and was requested to submit detailed descriptions of the project. I did so. I waited. Finally, when I had all but given up hope, I received permission to apply for a visa and proceed to Yaounde, the capital. I confess with some embarrassment to old Africa hands that I naïvely assumed this to be the end of my contacts with bureaucracy. I suppose that, at that stage, I pictured the administration as a group of informal "chaps" doing the small amount of administration necessary with good-natured common sense. In a country of seven million inhabitants, most of it would surely be done man-to-man in shirtsleeves as in the old British Empire days. The idiom would be one of solid understatement with everyone turning his hand to what needed to be done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伴随钞票与时间的点滴消逝，申请研究许可变得无比重要。大约一年前，我曾写信给喀麦隆有关单位，他们答应在审查结束前一定给我回音。我再度写信给他们，他们要求我寄上详细的计划内容。我照办。我等待。当我差不多放弃希望时，终于收到申请签证的许可，可以准备前往喀麦隆的首都雅温得（Yaoundé）。后来，我对熟悉非洲的老手尴尬承认，我居然天真以为这是我与官僚体系的最后接触。在我当时的想象中，喀国的行政部门是群不拘礼的家伙，以亲切、通情达理的态度处理小量、必要的行政事务。一个700万人口的国家必定遵循大英帝国的古风，以简单朴实、一对一方式处理行政。说他们人人热心协助，应当不以为过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I might have learnt all sorts of lessons from the Cameroonian Embassy, but I did not. Instead I put all conclusions in abeyance, in best anthropological fashion, waiting until all the evidence was in. Having telephoned the Embassy to make sure they were open, I turned up with all relevant documents, feeling rather proud of my efficiency in having the two necessary passport photos. The Embassy was shut. Prolonged ringing raised a grudging voice that refused to speak anything but French and told me to come back tomorrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去喀麦隆大使馆的经历应当让我受到教训，但是我没有。我谨守人类学优良传统，绝不妄下断论，直到铁证摆在眼前。我先打电话给大使馆，确定他们上班，才带着所有相关文件前往，一边洋洋自得效率非凡，居然准备了两张护照照片。大使馆没开门。我猛按门铃，引来一个只肯说法语的声音咆哮：明日再来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I returned the next day and managed to get as far as the hall. Here I was informed that the relevant gentleman was absent and it was not known when he would return. I received the impression that asking for a visa was a strange and unusual thing. One useful fact, however, was gleaned: I could not apply for a visa without a valid return air ticket. I went to the airline office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天我再度前往，这一次，获准进入大厅。他们告诉我负责的人外出，不知道什么时候回来。我有种感觉：申请喀麦隆签证一定是罕见、奇怪的事。不过，我得到一个有用信息：没有回程有效机票，不能申请签证。我于是前往航空公司。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Air Cameroon regarded all customers as a confounded nuisance. I did not realize at that time that this was the way all government monopolies are run in Cameroon and put it down to language difficulties. They were suspicious of cheques, cash was inconvenient. I ended up paying for my ticket in French travellers' cheques. What other people do I cannot imagine. (One sound rule for the beginner: always deal with exotic airlines through a British travel agent. They will take payment in normal forms of currency.) While there, I inquired about trains between Yaounde and N'gaoundere, my next stop up country. I was sternly informed that this was an airline office, not a railway office, but it so happened that there was an air-conditioned train between the two. The journey took about three hours.</div>

<div class="line_en">Flushed with triumph and armed with my ticket, I returned to the Embassy. The gentleman was still not back but I would be permitted to fill in a form in triplicate. I did so and was surprised to note that the top copy which I had laboriously completed was thrown away. I waited about an hour. Nothing happened. Meanwhile various people were drifting in and out, mostly speaking French. It is perhaps necessary to point out that Cameroon was an old German colony taken over by the British and French during the First World War and subsequently given independence as a federal republic, later replaced by a unified republic. Although Cameroon is theoretically bilingual in French and English, it is a bold man who hopes to get far on English alone. Eventually, a huge African woman entered and I was the subject of a long conversation in a language unknown to me. I suspect now that it was English. If anyone approaches you in old British territory speaking a totally unintelligible tongue of which even the basic sounds are quite unfamiliar, it is probably English. I was led into another office where numerous volumes were ranged around the walls. I noted with interest that these contained the photographs and details of prohibited persons. It is still astonishing to me that it is possible for such a young country to have prohibited so many people. Having sought me in vain for some considerable time, the woman lay aside the volumes with what appeared to be a deep sense of disappointment. The next problem lay in my having produced two passport photographs which were joined together. They should have been separate and I was rebuked for presenting them in this condition. There began a protracted search for the scissors. Many people were involved in this, furniture was moved, the volumes of prohibited persons were shaken. Trying to show willing, I looked half-heartedly on the floor. Again I was rebuked. This was an embassy and I was to touch and look at nothing. Finally, the scissors were traced to a man in the basement who, it appeared, was not authorized to possess them. This was explained at great length. We were all required to show our outrage. The next problem was whether the visa should be paid for or not. In my innocence I gladly offered to pay for it, not realizing that this was a major issue. The head of the section would have to decide. Back to the waiting room, where finally another Cameroonian appeared who perused my documents with great attention and required me to explain myself yet again, looking the whole time extremely suspicious of my motives. The basic difficulty here, as in other areas, is explaining why the British government should find it worth while to pay its young people fairly large sums of money to go off to desolate parts of the world purportedly to study peoples who are locally notorious for their ignorance and backwardness. How could anyone make money out of such studies? Clearly some sort of hidden purpose is involved. Spying, mineral prospecting or smuggling must be the real motive. The only hope is to pass oneself off as a harmless idiot who knows no better. I succeeded in this. Finally I was given my visa, a huge rubber-stamped confection with what was clearly a heavily Africanized version of Marianne, the French revolutionary heroine. As I left, I felt strangely tired with a lingering sense of humiliation and disbelief. It was a feeling I was to grow to know well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="满怀胜利、配备回程机票，我返回大使馆。那位先生还未回来，但是我可以先填一式三份的表格。我填了表格，却赫然发现我卖力填写的三联表格，最上面一张被弃置不用。我等了一个小时，毫无动静。大使馆里人群来去，大多说法语。在此有必要简述喀麦隆的历史。它原本是德国属地，一次大战期间被英国与法国占领，后来独立组成联邦共和，最后成为统一的共和国。虽然理论上喀麦隆是英、法双语，但只有莽汉才会妄想凭恃英语走遍喀麦隆。终于，一个异常胖大的非洲女人走进来，以一种我不懂的语言和旁人讨论我许久。我猜想那是英语。如果你碰到英国旧属地的人，使用你无法辨认，甚至连基本音都很陌生的语言，那很可能就是英语了。我被带进另一个房间，满墙的档案夹，勾起我极大兴趣，我发现里面全是黑名单人士的照片与详细资料。直到现在我仍很讶异，这么年轻的国家就能有这么多禁止入境人口。胖女士在档案里寻找我的名字，许久，一无所获，深感遗憾地将档案推到一旁。接下来的大问题是我的护照照片是两张连在一起。我怎么可以这样送来？应该先把它们剪开才对。接着他们上天入地寻找剪刀。许多人加入搜寻行列，移开家具，拿起黑名单档案夹抖动。为了表示自愿协助，我也半认真地趴在地上寻找，却又被呵斥了。这是大使馆，我不可碰触、窥视任何东西。最后，他们在地下室一位员工那儿找到剪刀，颇费唇舌地向我解释：地下室那家伙根本没资格使用剪刀，我们都得对此表示义愤填膺。接下来的问题是签证应不应收钱？我天真表示乐意付钱，殊不知这是天大地大的事，必须由部门主管决定。我又回到等候室，过了许久，一位喀麦隆男子终于现身，仔细阅读我的申请文件，要我再解释一遍申请签证的原因，从头到尾，他都很怀疑我的动机。你很难向他解释为何英国政府要资助年轻人一大笔钱，让他前往世界荒凉一隅，研究在当地素以落后无知恶名远扬的部族？这样的研究怎么能赚钱？显然背后有阴谋。间谍活动、矿藏探测、毒品走私才是真正动机。惟一的办法是装成无害的白痴，什么都不懂。我成功了。他们终于赐我签证，上面盖着复杂的橡皮章戳记，显然是非洲胖大版的玛莉安（法国革命女英雄）图像。当我离开时，一种奇特的疲惫感袭来，混合着屈辱与难以置信。我将越来越熟悉这种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I now had something like a week to put my affairs in order and complete my arrangements. Vaccinations had played quite a large role in my life for some months and there remained only a final yellow fever shot before I was fully proofed. Unfortunately, this gave me a fever and vomiting attacks that rather diminished my enjoyment of farewells. I was issued with an intimidating box of drugs and a list of the symptoms they would cure, almost all of which I already had from the inoculations.</div>

My immediate family, who were entirely innocent of anthropological expertise, knew only that I was mad enough to go to savage lands where I would live in the jungle, constantly menaced by lions and snakes, and might be lucky enough to escape the cooking pot. It came as some comfort to me when I was about to leave Dowayoland that the chief of my village said that he would gladly accompany me back to my English village but that he feared a country where it was always cold, where there were savage beasts like the European dogs at the mission and where it was known there were cannibals.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ethnographer is faced with a basic decision at the outset if he needs a vehicle. Either he can buy one here, fill it with all the goods he will need to survive and ship it out, or he can arrive unencumbered at his destination and buy what he needs from scratch. The advantage of the former method lies in cheapness and the certainty of finding what you want. Its disadvantage lies simply in the frustration of the extra contact with customs officials and other bureaucrats who will blandly impound it, charge duty on it, stand it in the monsoon till it rots, allow it to be rifled, insist on minute certified lists in quadruplicate, countersigned and stamped by other officials hundreds of miles away and otherwise gleefully harass and persecute the newcomer. Many of these difficulties will magically melt away in the face of a well-placed bribe, but the calculation of the appropriate sum and the point at which the bribe should be offered requires a fineness of touch that the newcomer will lack. He may well end up in serious trouble if he attempts this proceeding incautiously.</div>

<div class="line_en">A book should doubtless be compiled of "sayings to young ethnographers about to go into the field". It is rumoured that the eminent anthropologist Evans-Pritchard would simply tell his protégés, "Get yourself a decent hamper from Fortnum and Mason's and keep away from the native women." Another West Africanist would reveal that the secret of successful fieldwork lay in the possession of a good string vest. In my own case I was told to complete my will (which I did), to take nail varnish for the local dandies (which I didn't) and to buy myself a good penknife (which broke). A lady anthropologist revealed to me the address of a London shop where I could buy shorts with locust-proof pocket-flaps. I felt these to be an unnecessary luxury.</div>
