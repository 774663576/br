<div class="line_en">It was pretty, comfortable Mrs. Carmichael who explained everything. She was sent for at once, and came across the square to take Sara into her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened. The excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily almost overpowering to Mr. Carrisford in his weak condition.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He was not wicked, my dear," she answered. "He did not really lose your papa's money.

He almost died of brain fever, and long before he began to recover your poor papa was dead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他并不可恶，亲爱的，”她回答。‘他没有真的丢失你爸爸的钱财。只是他自以为把它丢失了，而且因为他很爱你爸爸，他的悲伤才使他病得这么厉害，心理有一度不正常。他几乎死于脑炎，早在开始恢复前你那可怜的爸爸就死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He believed you were in school in France," Mrs. Carmichael explained. "And he was continually misled by false clues. He has looked for you everywhere. When he saw you pass by, looking so sad and neglected, he did not dream that you were his friend's poor child; but because you were a little girl, too, he was sorry for you, and wanted to make you happier. And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try to make you comfortable."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他相信你是在法国求学，”卡迈克尔夫人解释道。“而且他接连不断地被错误线索领入歧途。他曾到处找你。当他看到你经过时，你显得那么悲伤和无人照料，但他做梦也想不到你就是他那朋友的可怜孩子。然而正因为你也是个小姑娘，他为你难过，并想要使你幸福一些。于是他吩咐拉姆·达斯爬进你的阁楼窗子，尽力让你过得舒适。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact, he did look changed. Here was the "Little Missus," and he had new things to think of and plan for already. In the first place, there was Miss Minchin. She must be interviewed and told of the change which had taken place in the fortunes of her pupil.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, oddly enough, Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr. Carmichael to go to her, by actually coming in search of her pupil herself. She had wanted Sara for something, and on inquiry had heard an astonishing thing. One of the housemaids had seen her steal out of the area with something hidden under her cloak, and had also seen her go up the steps of the next door and enter the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，大为奇怪的是铭钦女士居然亲自来找她的学生，这样卡迈克尔先生就省得再去找她了。她本来有些什么事要找萨拉，但经过盘问，听到了一桩惊人的事。有个女仆曾看见萨拉在外衣下面藏着什么东西，偷偷溜出小天井，还见她走上隔壁门前的台阶进了房子。">查看中文翻译</div>
