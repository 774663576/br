<div class="line_en">In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.</div>

<div class="line_en">It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill-The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it-and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座洞穴有个像是舷窗般浑圆、漆成绿色的大门，在正中央有个黄色的闪亮门把。大门打开之后，是一个圆管状像是隧道的客厅：这是个没有烟雾的舒适客厅，有着精心装饰的墙壁，地板上铺着地毯和磁砖，四处还摆着许多打磨光亮的椅子。由于哈比人超爱客人来访，因此这里还有很多很多的衣帽架。隧道继续延伸，蜿蜒地深入山丘中，附近许多哩的人们都叫这座山丘为“小丘”，小丘各个方向还盖了许多圆形的小门。哈比人可是不爬楼梯的：卧室、浴室、酒窖、餐点室（超多的呢！）、更衣室（他有一整间房间都是用来放衣服的）、厨房、饭厅，全部都在同一层楼，也都在同一条走廊上。最好的房间都是在左手边（继续往里面走也一样），因为只有这方向的房间才有窗户，这些浑圆的窗户可以俯瞰他美丽的花园，和一路延伸向河边的翠绿草地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这名哈比人生活相当富裕，他姓巴金斯。巴金斯一家人自古以来，就居住在小丘这一带，附近的邻居都很尊敬他们；不单只是因为他们大部分都很有钱，也是因为他们从来不冒险，不会做任何出人意料之外的事情：你在问巴金斯一家人任何问题之前，就可以先预料到他们的答案，根本不必要浪费这个力气。这个故事就是关于一名巴金斯家人如何意外地卷入冒险之中，并且做出和说出许多出人意料之外的事情来。他或许失去了邻居们的尊敬，但是至少获得了──算啦！到最后你就会知道他获得了什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mother of our particular hobbit-what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can get it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this hobbit-of Bilbo Baggins, that is-was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-clan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有关于我们这个哈比人的母亲──对啦，到底什么是哈比人？我想，时至今日，的确需要更进一步地描述哈比人；因为他们已经变得比较罕见，也比较畏惧我们这些大家伙（这是他们称呼我们的方式）。他们是相当矮小的种族，大概只有我们身体的一半高度，也比长了大胡子的矮人要矮，哈比人不留胡子。他们没有法力（或者仅有一点点），只有当我们这些笨重的大家伙，莽莽撞撞地像大象一般靠近他们的时候，他们才会使出凭空消失的把戏来。通常他们的肚子上都会有不少肥肉，喜欢穿着鲜艳的衣服（多半都是绿色和黄色），不穿鞋子，因为他们的小脚会长出天然的肉垫来，也会冒出和他们头发一样浓密的卷毛。哈比人拥有灵巧的褐色手指、开朗的面孔，笑起来更是十分爽朗（特别是在他们吃完晚饭之后，大笑更是必备的节目之一；而只要他们有机会，一天通常都会有两顿晚餐）。现在，你对他们大概已经有了粗浅的了解了。我之前刚说到，这个比尔博·巴金斯的母亲，就是鼎鼎大名的贝拉多娜·图克，是老图克大人三名出类拔萃的女儿之一。老图克大人则是住在“小河”边哈比人的领袖，这条河就是绕过小丘脚边的一条小河。大家常常说（其他家族的人常常说啦……）图克家族的远祖一定有人娶了个妖精当老婆；当然，这可信度并不高，只不过，他们一家人的确有点与众不同，偶尔会有成员离家出外冒险。他们会神秘地消失，家里的人则是三缄其口，不露任何口风。也就是因为这样，虽然图克家人比较有钱，但大伙还是比较尊敬巴金斯一家人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs. Bungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo's father, built the most luxurious hobbit-hole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful hobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，在贝拉多娜成了邦哥·巴金斯的妻子之后，她就没有什么惊人之举了。邦哥是比尔博的老爸，对他妻子可说是呵护备至，他为她建造了（一部分是用她的财产）在小丘邻近和小河流域一带最豪华的地洞。不过，她唯一的儿子比尔博，虽然看起来和他老爸一样老实可靠，但可能继承了图克家族的诡异血统，只是在等待适当的时机爆发而已。直到比尔博成年，甚至到了五十岁左右，这时机还是没有到来。在这段时间中，他就这么安安稳稳地居住在老爹留下来的地洞中，可说是与世无争。不过，奇妙的机缘就这么突如其来地降临了。那时，这世界比现在还要翠绿，也不那么吵杂，哈比人们依旧繁衍兴盛……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) -- Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.</div>

There's no hurry, we have all the day before us!" Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说的都对！”比尔博说：“而且，还非常适合在门外抽烟斗。如果你身上有带烟斗，不妨坐在我身边，尽管用我的菸叶！没什么好急的嘛！今天还有一整天可以过呢！”话一说完，比尔博就在门口的凳子上坐了下来，翘起二郎腿，吐出一个美丽的灰色烟圈；烟圈就这么完好如初飘啊飘，一直越过小丘顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I should think so-in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner! I can't think what anybody sees in them," said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smokering. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.</div>

Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers. "Dear me!" he went on. "Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves-or sailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter-I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business."</div>

Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others.

Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin's. Then Gandalf's smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous.

<div class="line_en">As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up-probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着他们的歌声，霍比特人在心中升腾起一股对美好事物的挚爱来，那些美好的东西是由灵巧的双手、智慧与魔法共同创造出来的，所以这种爱变得强烈而充满嫉妒，矮人心中的欲望被点燃了。这时，他身体内某种图克家族所特有的东西被唤醒了，他想去看看那巍峨的山脉，想聆听松树的歌吟和瀑布的轰鸣，想探索一下那些洞穴，想要随身配上一把宝剑而不只是一根手杖。他把目光投向窗外，黑暗的天空中星星已经升起在了树梢。他不禁联想到了矮人的宝藏在黑暗的洞穴中闪光。突然间，小河对岸的林子里亮起了一团火光——也许是谁点燃了营火——这让他想起了四处劫掠的恶龙盘踞在他的宁静小丘上，将它变成了一片火海。想到这里，他不由得打了个寒战，然后立刻恢复了清醒，又变回到与世无争的袋底洞的巴金斯先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all.

<div class="line_en">This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up, knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out "struck by lightning, struck by lightning!" over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是索林的讲话风格。他是个地位很重要的矮人，如果没人拦着他，他可以这样一直滔滔不绝地说下去，直到他喘不过气来为止，而且这些话里还没有哪点内容是有人不知道的。不过，这次他被粗鲁地打断了，因为可怜的比尔博再也听不下去了。一听见“可能再也回不来了”这几个字，他就感到有一声尖叫在他体内蹿起，没多久这声尖叫就冲了出来，像是冲出隧道的火车头拉响的汽笛。所有的矮人都腾地跳了起来，把桌子都给碰翻了。甘道夫立刻用魔杖点出一道蓝光，在耀眼的光芒中，大家看见可怜的霍比特人跪在地上，像正在融化的果冻那样打着颤。然后他颓然跌倒在地上，口中不停喊着“我被雷劈了，我被雷劈了”，一遍又一遍，好长时间都从他嘴里掏不出别的话来。大家伙儿于是抓住他，把他抱到客厅的沙发上，在他手边放了杯喝的，又继续回去讨论他们不想告诉人的事情去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took's great-grand-uncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Golfimbul's head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit-hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你真的看到过被戳痛的恶龙，那么你就会知道，用这种说法来形容任何一个霍比特人，都太诗意、太夸张了，即便是用来形容老图克的曾叔祖“吼牛”也仍是太过分了些。吼牛身形庞大（相对霍比特人而言），可以骑上一匹马。在绿野之战中，他一马当先地冲向格拉姆山半兽人的阵中，用一根木棒就干净利落地敲掉了他们的国王高尔夫酋的脑袋。他的脑袋在空中飞了有一百码，然后掉进一个兔子洞中。吼牛不仅以这种方式赢得了这场战斗，还捎带着发明了高尔夫球游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: "Humph!" (or some snort more or less like that). "Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过此时此刻，吼牛的那个温和柔弱得多的后代正躺在起居室中尚未完全苏醒。又过了一阵子，喝了一点酒之后，他才鬼头鬼脑、蹑手蹑脚地回到客厅门边。他正好听到格罗因说：“哼！”（或者某种与此多少类似的哼哼声）。“你们认为他能行吗？甘道夫说这个霍比特人很凶猛，这固然不错，可他如果稍微感到点兴奋就像这样尖叫，那可足以把恶龙一家老小都给叫醒，会害我们很多人送命的。我觉得他的尖叫听起来与其说是兴奋，倒还不如说是害怕呢！事实上，要不是因为门上有记号，我肯定会觉得我们来错了人家。我一看到那个胖家伙气喘吁吁地跑来跑去，心里就觉得不对劲。他看起来一点不像飞贼，倒更像是杂货店老板！”">查看中文翻译</div>

I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply not to be found.

<div class="line_en">"O very well," said Thorin. "Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops-and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again, and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather's halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy market of Dale was the wonder of the North.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically for ever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North, and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily-a fine adventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day) -- well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, it was only too common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons' way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose any one lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“毫无疑问，正是这把恶龙给招来了。恶龙会从人类、精灵和矮人手中抢夺黄金和珠宝，这你们知道，找到多少就抢走多少。只要它们活着（它们几乎能永远活下去，除非被杀），就会牢牢地看守着这些抢来的赃物，却哪怕连一个不值钱的黄铜戒指也不会拿来享受享受。尽管它们对宝物当下的市值常常知道得很清楚，可其实它们根本分不清做工的好坏。它们自己什么东西也做不来，哪怕是自己身上的鳞甲，就算有一小片松动了，也不懂该怎么修。那时候在大陆北方有许多的恶龙，由于矮人大多被杀或是往南逃，那里的黄金可能越来越少了，恶龙四处破坏，让情况变得越来越糟。这其中有一只特别贪婪、强壮与邪恶的大虫，叫作斯毛格。有一天，他腾身飞上天际，就朝着南方来了。我们最早听到的动静，仿佛是一阵来自北方的旋风，山上的松树在强风中发出吱吱嘎嘎的哀嚎。有些矮人正巧在外面（我有幸是其中的一个——那会儿我是个爱冒险的好孩子，经常到处乱跑，谁料那天却因此逃过一劫）——于是我们从很远的地方，看到恶龙口中喷出火焰落到了我们的山头上。然后他又顺着斜坡冲下来，等它到达树林的时候，树林变成了一片火海。那时，河谷城所有的警钟都响了起来，战士们纷纷拿起武器准备迎战。矮人们从大门里冲了出来，但恶龙就在门口等着他们。一个矮人也没有逃掉啊！河流化成蒸汽，浓雾笼罩谷地，恶龙在浓雾中扑向他们，杀死了大多数的战士——这是个寻常的悲惨故事，那时候这样的事简直太多了。然后他掉头从前门钻进山里，把所有厅堂、巷弄、隧道、地窖、房屋和走廊都转了个遍，打败了所有遇到的人。那之后，山里面一个活的矮人也没剩，斯毛格把他们所有的财富都掠为己有。按照恶龙的行事风格，他多半把这些宝藏收成一大堆，藏在洞穴深处，当床睡在上面。后来，它习惯了在晚上从大门出来，冲进谷地，把人类，尤其是少女掳去吃掉，直到河谷城化为废墟，居民们死的死、逃的逃。现在那里发生什么事我不是很清楚，但我想住得离山脉最靠近的也不会超过长湖的远端。">查看中文翻译</div>
