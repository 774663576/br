<div class="line_en">Later that same afternoon Mr Utterson found his way to Doctor Jekyll's house. Jekyll's servant, Poole, let him in at once and took him through the kitchen and across the back garden to the laboratory behind the house. It was the first time that Mr Utterson had seen his friend's laboratory, and he looked around curiously.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The newsboys were shouting about it in the street," Doctor Jekyll said. "A terrible business."</div>

<div class="line_en">The old servant led Mr Utterson through the laboratory and up some stairs to the doctor's private study above. This was a large room with tall, glass-fronted cupboards, a large mirror and a big, businesslike table. A good fire burned in the fireplace and beside it sat Doctor Jekyll, looking white and ill. Ina thin, tired voice he welcomed his friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老仆人带他经过实验室，上楼来到博士的私人书房。屋子很大，周围都是镶着玻璃的柜子，还有一面大镜子和一张井然有序的大办公桌。壁炉里火烧得很旺，火边坐着杰基尔博士，面色苍白，十分痛苦的样子。他声音微弱、无精打来地和朋友打了招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have you heard the news?" said Mr Utterson after the old servant had left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也听说这事了？”老仆人刚一退下，厄特森先生就问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let me ask you something," said the lawyer. "Sir Danvers Carew was my client, but you are my client too, and I want to know what I'm doing. You haven't tried to hide the murderer, have you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要问你些事，”律师说，“丹佛斯·卡鲁是我的委托人，但你也是，我要知道自己该如何行事。你不会想把凶手藏起来吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Utterson, I promise you," cried the doctor, "I promise you I'll never see him again. I've finished with him for ever. And now, indeed, he no longer needs my help. You don't know him like I do. He's safe, quite safe. Believe me, nobody will ever hear of Hyde again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“厄特森，我向你保证，”博士喊道，“我保证再也不见他了，我已跟他一刀两断了。实际上他也不需要我的帮助了。我了解他，你不了解，他现在很安全，非常安全。相信我，没人会再见到海德了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lawyer listened with a serious face. He did not like his friend's feverish, excited look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="律师听着，一脸的严肃，他不喜欢博士那发热病似的兴奋神态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You seem very sure of him," he replied. "I hope you're right. If he is caught and comes to trial, your name may be mentioned."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看起来你对他挺放心，”他答道，“希望你是对的，要是抓住了他，弄到法庭上，你的名字也会被提出来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm absolutely sure of him," answered Jekyll. "I can't tell you how I know, but I'm certain. But can you please advise me about one thing? I've received a letter and I don't know whether to show it to the police. May I leave it in your hands, Utterson?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对他的确有把握，”杰基尔回答说，“我不能告诉你为什么，但我的确放心。可有一件事我要请教一下，我刚收到一封信，我不知道是否应该交给警方，厄特森，我交给你，好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Doctor Jekyll. "I don't care what happens to Hyde. I was thinking of my own reputation… Anyway, here is the letter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”杰基尔博士说，“我倒不在乎海德会怎样。我担心的是自己的名声……不管怎么说，这就是那封信。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was written in a strange, pointed handwriting and signed 'Edward Hyde'. "I am sorry that I have been so ungrateful in the past for your many generous acts," it began. "Please don't worry about me. I am quite safe and I am certain that I can escape unharmed whenever I wish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这封信笔迹奇特，线条直愣愣的，签名是‘爱德华·海德’。信开头写道：“很久以来承蒙您恩眷，沾沐厚泽，无以为报；实为遗憾。请您不必为我担心，我十分安全，肯定会毫发无损地逃出去，任我遨游。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"By the way," he said, "a letter was handed in today for your master. Who brought it, and what did he look like?"</div>
