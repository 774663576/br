<div class="line_en">In the morning, Mariam was given a long-sleeved, dark green dress to wear over white cotton trousers. Afsoon gave her a green hijab and a pair of matching sandals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jalil showed her to a chair. He was wearing a light brown suit and a red tie. His hair was washed. When he pulled out the chair for her, he tried to smile encouragingly. Khadija and Afsoon sat on Mariam's side of the table this time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The mullah motioned toward the veil, and Nargis arranged it on Mariam's head before taking a seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毛拉指了指面纱，娜尔吉斯将它蒙在玛丽雅姆头上，然后让她坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was taken to the room with the long, brown table, except now there was a bowl of sugar-coated almond candy in the middle of the table, a Koran, a green veil, and a mirror. Two men Mariam had never seen before -- witnesses, she presumed -- and a mullah she did not recognize were already seated at the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她再次被带到棕色长桌所在的房间，只不过现在桌子中间摆着的是一碗杏仁糖，一本《古兰经》，一条绿色面纱和一面镜子。桌子旁边坐着两个玛丽雅姆没有见过的男人——是证婚人吧，她猜想——和一个她没见过的毛拉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam smelled him before she saw him. Cigarette smoke and thick, sweet cologne, not faint like Jalil's. The scent of it flooded Mariam's nostrils. Through the veil, from the corner of her eye, Mariam saw a tall man, thick-bellied and broad-shouldered, stooping in the doorway. The size of him almost made her gasp, and she had to drop her gaze, her heart hammering away. She sensed him lingering in the doorway. Then his slow, heavy-footed movement across the room. The candy bowl on the table clinked in tune with his steps. With a thick grunt, he dropped on a chair beside her. He breathed noisily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆还没见到他，就先嗅到他的气味。一股香烟的味道，混杂着古龙水香味，很浓郁，不像扎里勒的那么淡雅。玛丽雅姆觉得这古龙水的香气很刺鼻。隔着面纱，她的眼角余光瞥见一个高高的汉子正弯腰走进门口，他的肚子很大，肩膀很宽。他的个子差点吓了她一跳。她垂下眼光，心跳越来越剧烈。她感觉到他在门口逗留了一会。接着他迈着沉重的脚步慢慢走进了房间。他的脚步震得桌子上的糖碗叮当响。他闷哼一声，在她身边的椅子坐下。他的呼吸很吵人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mullah gave a few blessings, said a few words about the importance of marriage. He asked Jalil if he had any objections to this union, and Jalil shook his head. Then the mullah asked Rasheed if he indeed wished to enter into a marriage contract with Mariam. Rasheed said, "Yes." His harsh, raspy voice reminded Mariam of the sound of dry autumn leaves crushed underfoot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毛拉说了几句祝词，又说了几句关于婚姻的重要性的话。他问扎里勒对这门亲事有没有什么反对意见，扎里勒摇摇头。然后他问拉希德，是否真心实意地愿意娶玛丽雅姆为妻，拉希德说“是的”。他的嗓子很粗哑，让玛丽雅姆想起秋天的落叶在她脚下被踩碎时发出的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mullah welcomed them. He said this would not be a traditional nikka.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毛拉对他们的到来表示欢迎。他说这将不会是一次传统的结婚仪式。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I understand that Rasheed agha has tickets for the bus to Kabul that leaves shortly. So, in the interest of time, we will bypass some of the traditional steps to speed up the proceedings."</div>

<div class="line_en">He asked the question two more times. When Mariam didn't answer, he asked it once more, this time more forcefully. Mariam could feel Jalil beside her shifting on his seat, could sense feet crossing and uncrossing beneath the table. There was more throat clearing. A small, white hand reached out and flicked a bit of dust off the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又问了两次这个问题。玛丽雅姆依然没有回答，他再问了一次，这一次语气更加迫切了。玛丽雅姆能感觉到身边的扎里勒坐不安席，能感觉到桌子下面有几只脚不停地伸出缩回。再也没有人假咳了。一只白皙的小手伸出来，掸掉桌子上的一点尘灰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“实际上，”毛拉说，“这必须由她自己来回答。她可以等到我问第三次的时候才开口。毕竟，这是他来向她提亲，而不是她在追求他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“玛丽雅姆。”扎里勒低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mirror, Mariam had her first glimpse of Rasheed: the big, square, ruddy face; the hooked nose; the flushed cheeks that gave the impression of sly cheerfulness; the watery, bloodshot eyes; the crowded teeth, the front two pushed together like a gabled roof; the impossibly low hairline, barely two finger widths above the bushy eyebrows; the wall of thick, coarse, salt-and-pepper hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在镜子中，玛丽雅姆第一次看到了拉希德：红红的大国字脸；鹰钩鼻子；脸颊也是红扑扑的，给人一种既狡猾又兴奋的感觉；迷蒙的双眼充满了血丝；牙齿长得密密麻麻，突出的两个门牙活像隆起的屋顶；发际线极低，和浓密的眉毛几乎只有两个手指那么宽的距离；粗硬的头发已经有点花白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A mirror was passed beneath the veil. In it, Mariam saw her own face first, the archless, unshapely eyebrows, the flat hair, the eyes, mirthless green and set so closely together that one might mistake her for being cross-eyed. Her skin was coarse and had a dull, spotty appearance. She thought her brow too wide, the chin too narrow, the lips too thin. The overall impression was of a long face, a triangular face, a bit houndlike. And yet Mariam saw that, oddly enough, the whole of these unmemorable parts made for a face that was not pretty but, somehow, not unpleasant to look at either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人将一面镜子递到面纱之下。从镜子中，玛丽雅姆先是看到自己的脸庞：平直而且并不匀称的双眉；黯淡无光的头发；一双忧郁的眼睛靠得很近，人们或许会误认为她是斗鸡眼。她的皮肤很粗糙，长着斑点的脸看上去有点呆滞。她觉得她的天庭太宽，下巴太尖，嘴唇太薄。这张脸给人整体的感觉就是一张长长的三角脸，有点像猎犬。然而玛丽雅姆也看到，由平平无奇的五官构成的这张脸虽然总体来说并不漂亮，但非常奇怪的是，它看上去也不会让人产生不快的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They exchanged the thin gold bands that Rasheed fished from his coat pocket. His nails were yellow-brown, like the inside of a rotting apple, and some of the tips were curling, lifting. Mariam's hands shook when she tried to slip the band onto his finger, and Rasheed had to help her. Her own band was a little tight, but Rasheed had no trouble forcing it over her knuckles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们交换了拉希德从外套口袋中掏出来的两只薄薄的金戒指。他的指甲黄得像烂苹果的果肉，而且有几个弯曲的指甲尖还向上翘。玛丽雅姆试图给他戴上戒指时，双手不停颤抖，拉希德握住她的手，让她稳定下来。她自己的戒指稍微有点紧，但拉希德毫不费力地将它滑过她的指节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">RASHEED WAITED in the multicolored bus. Mariam could not see him from where she stood with Jalil, by the rear bumper, only the smoke of his cigarette curling up from the open window. Around them, hands shook and farewells were said. Korans were kissed, passed under. Barefoot boys bounced between travelers, their faces invisible behind their trays of chewing gum and cigarettes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德在那辆五颜六色的客车中等待。玛丽雅姆和扎里勒站在客车尾部的防撞杆旁边，看不到他，只见到他的香烟的烟雾自打开的车窗袅袅飘出。在他们身边，有些人在握手道别。有些人亲吻了《古兰经》，从它下面走过。几个赤脚的男孩在旅客之间兜售东西，他们的脸被装着口香糖和香烟的托盘遮住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a pretty ring," one of the wives said. "It's lovely, Mariam."</div>

<div class="line_en">Jalil was busy telling her that Kabul was so beautiful, the Moghul emperor Babur had asked that he be buried there.

She did not turn to look when Jalil's palms pressed on the glass, when his knuckles rapped and rapped on it. When the bus jerked forward, she did not turn to see him trotting alongside it.
