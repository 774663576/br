<div class="line_en">Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.</div>

<div class="line_en">But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，到目前为止也没有什么麻烦；由于巴金斯先生十分慷慨，人们也就愿意原谅他的特立独行和得天独厚的好运。他依旧时常拜访亲戚（当然，素来不合的塞克维尔巴金斯一家是个例外），在地位较低和贫穷的家族中，他也拥有许多的崇拜者。不过，他一直没有什么亲近的朋友，直到他的年轻表亲年纪稍长之后才有了转变。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September 22nd. "You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad," said Bilbo one day; "and then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together." At that time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些表亲之中最年长的是佛罗多·巴金斯，同时也是比尔博最宠爱的对象。当比尔博九十九岁的时候，他将佛罗多收为养子，接他到袋底洞来住。这终于打破了塞克维尔一家人一直觊觎继承袋底洞的希望。比尔博和佛罗多刚好都是同一天生的，九月二十二日。“佛罗多啊，我说你最好过来跟我一起住吧，”比尔博有天这么说；“这样我们就可以一起舒舒服服的过生日了。”当时佛罗多还只是个少年。哈比人一向把成年的三十三岁和童年之间的二十多年间称做少年时期。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of his "coming of age".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了十二年。每年这家人都会联合举办盛大的生日宴会，不过，现在大家都知道今年秋天的计划是非比寻常的。比尔博今年将满一百一十一岁，数字本身就相当特殊；即使对哈比人来说，这也已经是十分长寿的年纪了。（老图克大人也不过只活了一百三十岁）。而佛罗多今年则是满三十三岁，这是很重要的一个数字，因为今年他即将成年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比屯和临水区一带的居民早就开始议论纷纷，有关这即将来临的大活动也传遍了整个夏尔。比尔博·巴金斯先生的冒险经历和独特的行事作风又再度成为街头巷尾的话题，老一辈的人突然间发现自己在这股怀旧风潮的推波助澜下，成了十分受欢迎的人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I've always said," the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to him, calling him "Master Hamfast", and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables -- in the matter of "roots", especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我老早就说，比尔博先生是个相当好的哈比人，”老家伙宣称。这是千真万确的，因为比尔博对他非常有礼貌，平常都称呼他为哈姆法斯特先生，并且经常的在蔬菜种植的问题上请教他，特别是在根茎类植物的种植上更是执礼甚恭。老家伙在马铃薯这类植物方面可是第一把交椅。（连他自己也不吝承认）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But what about this Frodo that lives with him?" asked Old Noakes of Bywater. "Baggins is his name, but he's more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但和他住在一起的佛罗多又怎么样？”临水区的老诺克问道。“他也叫作巴金斯，但他也有一半烈酒鹿家的血统。我也搞不清楚为什么会有哈比屯的巴金斯家人想要去找雄鹿地的怪家伙结婚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And no wonder they're queer," put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer's next-door neighbour), "if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half the tales be true."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也不能怪他们不合常理，”老家伙的隔壁邻居图伏特老爹说，“他们住在烈酒河的另一边，又靠近老林那边。那里可是个受诅咒的不祥之地。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're right, Dad!" said the Gaffer. "Not that the Brandybucks of Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river -- and that isn't natural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说的对，老爹！”老家伙说。“虽然雄鹿地的烈酒鹿那家子人不是住在老林里面，但他们的行事作风真的很奇怪。他们会在那条大河上搞艘船跑来跑去，这可不是正当人家会做的事情。难怪那里老是会有麻烦事。不管怎么样，佛罗多先生都是个好青年。他和比尔博先生很像，连想法都差不了多少。毕竟他父亲那边还是有巴金斯家的血统。德罗哥·巴金斯可是个好人，在他淹死之前可是个洁身自爱的家伙哪！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Drownded?" said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“淹死？”听众中有人反问。他们当然听过这类恐怖的谣言，不过哈比人就是喜欢这种家族历史的故事；他们这次又想再听一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, so they say," said the Gaffer. "You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took's daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，他们是这样说的，”老家伙道。“我想一下喔，德罗哥先生娶了可怜的普丽谬拉·烈酒鹿小姐。她是比尔博先生母系的表妹（她妈妈是老图克最小的女儿）；德罗哥则是他的旁系亲戚。所以，佛罗多就是比尔博的表妹的儿子，这关系可深远着哪！德罗哥先生结婚之后就经常和去烈酒厅的岳父家斯混。（这家伙嘴可馋着呢，他岳父葛巴达克又爱吃好菜，两人就这么一拍即合）当时他去烈酒河上泛舟，他和他的妻子就这么翻船淹死了。可怜的佛罗多那时还只是个小孩啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight," said Old Noakes; "and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman," said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. "There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说山迪曼哪，你最好不要把这些谣言照单全收，”老家伙不太喜欢眼前的磨坊主人。“老是提一些推推拉拉的事情没意思嘛！船这种东西很危险，就算你坐好不动，不想惹麻烦，还是有可能倒楣的。不管啦，反正佛罗多最后就是成了孤儿，被丢在那群雄鹿地的怪人之中，在烈酒厅被养大。那里就像个大杂院一样。葛巴达克大人在那边起码有几百个亲戚。比尔博先生把这位小朋友带回来教养，真是做了件好事啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won't never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过，我也明白这对于那些巴金斯家的塞克维尔一系人来说是个重大打击。当年在比尔博先生失踪，大家都以为他去世之后，他们满心以为终于可以继承袋底洞。他却又神秘出现，把他们赶了出来。而且老天保佑，比尔博先生越活越硬朗，一点都看不出来老态！突然，他又找了个继承人，备齐了一切的文件。我看这回塞克维尔他们是想都不要想踏进袋底洞一步了。我自己也希望那里不要被他们糟蹋了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell," said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. "All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I've heard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听说那里面藏了很多钱耶，”一个从西区米丘窟来做生意的陌生人说。“这座山里面的隧道全都装满了许多箱子，里面都是黄金、白银和珠宝。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you've heard more than I can speak to," answered the Gaffer. I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I'd not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn't enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He's in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo's tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters -- meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你听说的比我知道的还要多，”老家伙回答。“我不知道什么珠宝。比尔博先生对钱财很大方，手头也很阔绰，但我没听说什么挖隧道的事情。大概六十年前，我小时候亲眼见到比尔博先生回来的样子。那时我才刚当上老何曼的学徒（他是我爹的表亲），他派我去袋底洞维持秩序，避免在拍卖的时候让闲杂人等把花园给踩乱了。正当大家急着拍卖比尔博先生的老家和财产时，他突然牵着小马走上这座山，马背上还有好几个大袋子和箱子。我想那里面一定都是从外面世界带回来的财宝；有人说外面有很多金山。但是，我看到的东西也不够把隧道塞满。我儿子山姆大概会知道的更清楚。他常常进出袋底洞。这孩子最喜欢听故事，所有比尔博先生的故事他都背的滚瓜烂熟。比尔博先生甚至还教他识字，各位别露出那种表情，他可是一片好心。但愿不会有什么麻烦才好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first," argued the miller, voicing common opinion. "He's often away from home.

<div class="line_en">"And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman," retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even more than usual. If that's being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There's some not far away that wouldn't offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone's going to be invited to the party, and there's going to be presents, mark you, presents for all -- this very month as is."</div>

<div class="line_en">That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks -- fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.</div>

<div class="line_en">Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G and the elf-rune,.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was Gandalf's mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the "attractions" at the Party.

Lanterns were hung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field.

A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away presents to all and sundry -- the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebody's birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week.

There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon -- not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is the signal for supper!" said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal.

Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high reputation.</div>

There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them bore the mark DALE on them; which did not convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但比尔博并没有说话。他从附近的一名年轻人手中抢来一把号角，使劲的吹了三声。众人的喧闹这才安静下来。“我不会耽搁各位太久的时间，”他大喊。所有的听众都情不自禁的欢呼。“我把你们都找来是有目的的。”他说“目的”这两个字的口气十分特殊，现场一时间陷入死寂，还有一两个图克家的人紧张的竖直了耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of approval.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，有三个目的！第一，是告诉你们我非常的喜欢你们，和你们这些好人一起度过的一百一十一年实在太精彩，也太短暂了。”众人响起如雷的掌声。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们其中有许多人是我想要认识，却没有机会深交的；另外则有许多人值得我投入更深的感情。”这段话大出众人意料之外，由于太过难懂，四下只传来零星的掌声。众人的小脑袋都在拼命转动着，希望能够搞懂这段话是褒是贬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of "Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo," from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what was meant by "coming into his inheritance".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二，是为了庆祝我的生日。”众人再度欢呼。“我应该说是‘我们’的生日。因为今天当然也是我的继承人佛罗多的生日。他今天成年，也终于获得了继承我家业的资格。”有些长辈高兴的鼓掌，年轻人则是开始起哄，大喊“佛罗多！佛罗多！佛罗多万岁！”塞克维尔一家人则是皱起眉头，试图要搞懂所谓的“继承家业”到底是怎么一回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only say "thag you very buch". I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to talk at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跳下椅子，随即消失了。不知从什么地方传来一阵强光，所有的宾客都感到一阵目眩。当他们张开眼睛的时候，比尔博已经消失的无影无踪。一百四十四名吃惊的哈比人就这样张口结舌的坐在位子上。傲多·傲脚老伯气的不停跺脚。在短暂的沉默之后，所有的巴金斯家人、波芬家人、图克家人、烈酒鹿家人、布罗斯家人、博格家人、抱腹家人、獾屋家人、健体家人、吹号者家人和傲脚家人在同一时间开始大呼小叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. "He's mad. I always said so," was probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo's behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.</div>

<div class="line_en">But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda: "There's something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him." He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo's empty chair, and ignored all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他无声无息的走回家门口，脸上挂着微笑，静静的听着帐棚和宴会其它场地所传来的笑语声。然后他才踏进家门。他脱下了为了宴会而穿的礼服，用干净的纸张将他华丽的丝质外套折好，包起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他飞快的换上一套旧衣服，腰间系上一条用了好多年的皮带。上面挂着一柄插在黑皮鞘内的短剑。他打开一个充满驱虫丸味道的上锁抽屉，拿出一件连帽的旧斗篷。比尔博收藏它们的样子彷佛这套衣服价值连城，但实际上，这套衣服不只满是补丁，连原来的颜色都褪的看不太出来了。旁观者最多只能猜到这件衣服原来是深绿色的。这套衣服似乎对他来说太大了些。接着，他又走进书房，从一个大保险箱中拿出一个被旧衣服包着的包裹、一份皮面的抄本、一个涨鼓鼓的信封。他将那抄本和包裹塞到旁边一个快满的大袋子里面。他接着将金戒指连着练子放进信封内，顺手将封口黏了起来，并且在收件人的位置上写下佛罗多的名字。一开始他将这信封放在壁炉上，随即又将它塞回口袋里。此时，大门打了开来，甘道夫面色凝重的走进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo's father.

<div class="line_en">Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed -- to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里离开了很长的一段时间，让他们有时间发现那箱临别的礼物。这可没让他们的心情好过起来。最后梅里终于带他们去书房暂坐。佛罗多坐在书桌后，面前堆着许多的文件。他看起来的确无法抽空（至少在接见塞克维尔这家人的时候是这样子的）。接着他站了起来，手摸着口袋中的某样东西。不过，他说话的口气还是相当客气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and unlabelled things.

<div class="line_cn" title="塞克维尔家的人就没有这么客气了。他们一开始就提议用贱价收买很多没标签的珍贵物品。当佛罗多表明只有比尔博指定的物品才会送人时，他们又开始抱怨这一切都不公平，其中必定有诈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Foiled again!" he said to his wife. "And after waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!" He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这次又落空了！”他对妻子说。“我们都等了六十年！就只有汤匙？胡扯！”他在佛罗多面前气冲冲的弹了弹手指，忿忿的离开。罗贝拉可没这么容易摆平。一段时间之后，佛罗多踏出书房，看看事情进行的是否顺利。他发现罗贝拉还在四处鬼头鬼脑的刺探着，敲打着墙壁和墙角。他坚决护送她离开，同时还从她的雨伞中抄出了几样不小心掉进去的小（却很值钱）东西。她涨红着脸，彷佛准备说出什么惊天动地的诅咒。但她转过身却只勉强挤出几句：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too? You don't belong here; you're no Baggins -- you -- you're a Brandybuck!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding -- unless the search is interrupted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他们开始在洞里面巡逻，抓出了三个年轻的哈比人。（两个波芬家，一个博格家的小子）他们正在一间房间中的墙壁上打洞。佛罗多还和桑丘·傲脚（傲脚老伯的曾孙）起了些争执，这家伙在储藏室里面准备了一大堆工具，正想要开挖。比尔博的黄金传说激起了很多人的好奇和兴趣。因为，传说中的黄金（神秘获得的黄金，而不是偷抢来的）只要被人找到，就属于那个人的；除非有人打断了对方的挖掘。">查看中文翻译</div>
