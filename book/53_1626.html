<div class="line_en">Another force to contend with. Another power player who has decided to use me as a piece in her games, although things never seem to go according to plan. First there were the Gamemakers, making me their star and then scrambling to recover from that handful of poisonous berries. Then President Snow, trying to use me to put out the flames of rebellion, only to have my every move become inflammatory. Next, the rebels ensnaring me in the metal claw that lifted me from the arena, designating me to be their Mockingjay, and then having to recover from the shock that I might not want the wings. And now Coin, with her fistful of precious nukes and her well-oiled machine of a district, finding it's even harder to groom a Mockingjay than to catch one. But she has been the quickest to determine that I have an agenda of my own and am therefore not to be trusted. She has been the first to publicly brand me as a threat.</div>

<div class="line_en">After I rinse the lather from my body, I turn to find Octavia waiting with a towel. She is so altered from the woman I knew in the Capitol, stripped of the gaudy clothing, the heavy makeup, the dyes and jewelry and knickknacks she adorned her hair with. I remember how one day she showed up with bright pink tresses studded with blinking colored lights shaped like mice. She told me she had several mice at home as pets. The thought repulsed me at the time, since we consider mice vermin, unless cooked. But perhaps Octavia liked them because they were small, soft, and squeaky. Like her. As she pats me dry, I try to become acquainted with the District 13 Octavia. Her real hair turns out to be a nice auburn. Her face is ordinary but has an undeniable sweetness. She's younger than I thought. Maybe early twenties. Devoid of the three-inch decorative nails, her fingers appear almost stubby, and they can't stop trembling. I want to tell her it's okay, that I'll see that Coin never hurts her again. But the multicolored bruises flowering under her green skin only remind me how impotent I am.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我冲掉身上的肥皂泡，奥克塔维亚正拿着一条毛巾等着我。与在凯匹特时相比，她的变化很大。她华丽的时装、脸上的浓妆以及玲珑的饰品都已不见。我记得曾有一天她头戴老鼠造型的闪闪发光的鲜粉色饰品出现在我面前。她告诉我家里养了几只老鼠宠物。当时我听了觉得很恶心，在我们眼里，老鼠只能做熟了吃，那是有害动物。可奥克塔维亚喜欢它们，也许是因为它们小巧玲珑、身体柔软，还会吱吱地叫，与她很相像。在她给我擦身的时候，我试图熟悉奥克塔维亚。她的头发原来是赤褐色，长相一般，但却十分甜美。她比我原以为的要年轻，也许只有二十多岁。在除掉三英寸长的华丽指甲后，她的手指看上去简直有些短粗，而且在不停地颤抖。我想告诉她没什么大不了的，我不会再让科恩伤害她了。可是她绿色皮肤下的片片青紫告诉了我，我的话语是多么的苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Remake her to Beauty Base Zero," Fulvia ordered first thing this morning. "We'll work from there." Beauty Base Zero turns out to be what a person would look like if they stepped out of bed looking flawless but natural. It means my nails are perfectly shaped but not polished. My hair soft and shiny but not styled. My skin smooth and clear but not painted. Wax the body hair and erase the dark circles, but don't make any noticeable enhancements. I suppose Cinna gave the same instructions the first day I arrived as a tribute in the Capitol. Only that was different, since I was a contestant. As a rebel, I thought I'd get to look more like myself. But it seems a televised rebel has her own standards to live up to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把她重新整回到基础美容状态。”这是弗莱维今早发出的第一道指令。“我们要从这儿开始。”基础美容状态是指一个人清晨刚睡醒时的清爽而自然的状态，也就是说我的指甲光洁但却没有修饰、头发柔软光亮却没有做发型、皮肤光滑清洁却没有化妆。但似乎出现在电视镜头前的反抗者要有新的标准。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's no simple job getting me back to Beauty Base Zero, even with the elaborate arsenal of products, tools, and gadgets Plutarch had the foresight to bring from the Capitol. My preps do pretty well until they try to address the spot on my arm where Johanna dug out the tracker. None of the medical team was focusing on looks when they patched up the gaping hole. Now I have a lumpy, jagged scar that ripples out over a space the size of an apple. Usually, my sleeve covers it, but the way Cinna's Mockingjay costume is designed, the sleeves stop just above the elbow. It's such a concern that Fulvia and Plutarch are called in to discuss it. I swear, the sight of it triggers Fulvia's gag reflex. For someone who works with a Gamemaker, she's awfully sensitive. But I guess she's used to seeing unpleasant things only on a screen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让我回到基础美容状态可不是件容易的事。普鲁塔什已经很有预见性地从凯匹特带来了各种工具、化妆品、饰品，我的化妆师也使出浑身解数，但约翰娜从我胳膊上取追踪器而留下的那块伤疤却很难处理。当时为我缝合伤口的医生没有一个考虑到它的外观。现在我胳膊上有一个苹果大小的疙里疙瘩的疤痕。平时这疤痕被袖子遮住了，但是西纳设计的嘲笑鸟的服装袖口正好到胳膊肘部。事情很严重，不得不叫来富尔维亚和普鲁塔什商讨此事。我敢说，富尔维亚看到这疤痕一定会引起呕吐反应。对于一个与饥饿游戏组织者一起工作的人来说，她算是一个极为敏感的人，这也许是因为她看到的恐怖场景仅限于屏幕的缘故吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flavius, too, appears washed out without his purple lipstick and bright clothes. He's managed to get his orange ringlets back in some sort of order, though. It's Venia who's the least changed. Her aqua hair lies flat instead of in spikes and you can see the roots growing in gray. However, the tattoos were always her most striking characteristic, and they're as golden and shocking as ever. She comes and takes the towel from Octavia's hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同样，弗莱维除掉紫色唇膏，脱掉华丽的衣装后，看上去也苍白倦怠。他尽量保持自己橘色的发卷整洁服帖。只有维尼娅的变化最小。她淡绿色的头发已经放下来，而不像原来那样盘起来，可以看到发根已经长出了灰色的头发。然而，那文身是她最具特点的标志，它像以往一样是抢眼的金色。她走过来，接过奥克塔维亚手里的毛巾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Katniss is not going to hurt us," she says quietly but firmly to Octavia. "Katniss did not even know we were here. Things will be better now." Octavia gives a slight nod but doesn't dare look me in the eye.</div>

Leevy, who was my neighbor back in 12, gives a cautious hello to the preps, and Gale's mother, Hazelle, who must know about their imprisonment, holds up a spoonful of the stew. "Don't worry," she says. "Tastes better than it looks."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gale, who's not usually much of a talker during meals, makes an effort to keep the conversation going, asking about the makeover.

"Katniss, she's running this district. She can't do it if it seems like she's caving in to your will."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖尔一般吃饭时没什么话，可今天他努力找话题，他问起了嘲笑鸟造型的事。我知道他是试图缓和气氛。昨晚我们之间产生了激烈的争论，他责怪我逼得科恩别无选择，正因为我提出几个胜利者的豁免条件，为了平衡，科恩也只好开出她自己的条件。“凯特尼斯，她是这个区的统治者。她不能在公众面前显得事事听从你的安排。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I should've just gone with the program and let the other tributes take their chances? Not that it matters, because that's what we're all doing anyway!" That was when I'd slammed the door in his face. I hadn't sat with him at breakfast, and when Plutarch had sent him down to training this morning, I'd let him go without a word.

<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说我根本不该这么做，而让他们自己去撞大运？其实这么做也没什么了不得，反正我们都是在碰运气！”说到这里，我气冲冲地砰的一声把门关上，把他关在门外。我吃早饭时也没跟他坐在一块，后来普鲁塔什让他去参加训练，我也没跟他说上话。我心里明白，他是关心我才说的那些话，可我需要的是他站在我一边而不是科恩一边。他怎么可能连这个都不知道？">查看中文翻译</div>

Inside is the first beautiful thing I've seen in the District 13 compound: a replication of a meadow, filled with real trees and flowering plants, and alive with hummingbirds. Beetee sits motionless in a wheelchair at the center of the meadow, watching a spring-green bird hover in midair as it sips nectar from a large orange blossom. His eyes follow the bird as it darts away, and he catches sight of us. He gives a friendly wave for us to join him inside.</div>

Beetee has to leave his wheelchair outside, although they provide him with another once we're through security.

<div class="line_en">I set the case flat on the floor and undo the latches along one side. The top opens on silent hinges. Inside the case, on a bed of crushed maroon velvet, lies a stunning black bow. "Oh," I whisper in admiration. I lift it carefully into the air to admire the exquisite balance, the elegant design, and the curve of the limbs that somehow suggests the wings of a bird extended in flight. There's something else.

Between the two, I can shoot with accuracy over one hundred yards. The variety of arrows -- razor sharp, incendiary, explosive -- turn the bow into a multipurpose weapon. Each one is recognizable by a distinctive colored shaft. I have the option of voice override at any time, but have no idea why I would use it. To deactivate the bow's special properties, I need only tell it "Good night." Then it goes to sleep until the sound of my voice wakes it again.</div>

I sit patiently through the rest of the paint job and don my costume, which now includes a bloody bandage over the scar on my arm to indicate I've been in recent combat. Venia affixes my mockingjay pin over my heart. I take up my bow and the sheath of normal arrows that Beetee made, knowing they would never let me walk around with the loaded ones. Then we're out on the soundstage, where I seem to stand for hours while they adjust makeup and lighting and smoke levels. Eventually, the commands coming via intercom from the invisible people in the mysterious glassed-in booth become fewer and fewer. Fulvia and Plutarch spend more time studying and less time adjusting me. Finally, there's quiet on the set. For a full five minutes I am simply considered.
