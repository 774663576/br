<div class="line_en">On the fifth day, there was much excitement when Max opened his eyes, if only for a few moments. What he predominantly saw (and what a frightening version it must have been close-up) was Rosa Hubermann, practically slinging an armful of soup into his mouth. "Swallow," she advised him.

The one frustration was that she kept having to skip whole chapters on account of many of the pages being stuck together. It had not dried well.

How could something so seemingly insignificant give comfort to someone? A ribbon in a gutter. A pinecone on the street. A button leaning casually against a classroom wall. Aflat round stone from the river. If nothing else, it showed that she cared, and it might give them something to talk about when Max woke up.</div>

The leaf was dry and hard, like toasted bread, and there were hills and valleys all over its skin. Somehow, the leaf had made its way into the school hallway and into that closet. Like half a star with a stem. Liesel reached in and twirled it in her fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶子是一片枫叶，落在水桶和羽毛掸子之间，莉泽尔是在学校杂物间里发现它的。门轻轻地开着一条缝。枫叶又干又脆，就像烤熟的面包，叶片表面像是有山峦和低谷。不知为什么，这片叶子竟来到学校的走廊上，飘进了杂物间。它像是一颗带着柄的星星。莉泽尔闪进来，将它捏在指间捻弄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Papa sat on the floor, in the corner, workless as usual. Luckily, he would soon be leaving for the Knoller with his accordion. His chin resting on his knees, he listened to the girl he'd struggled to teach the alphabet. Reading proudly, she unloaded the final frightening words of the book to Max Vandenburg.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Viennese air was fogging up the windows of the train that morning, and as the people traveled obliviously to work, a murderer whistled his happy tune. He bought his ticket. There were polite greetings with fellow passengers and the conductor. He even gave up his seat for an elderly lady and made polite conversation with a gambler who spoke of American horses. After all, the whistler loved talking. He talked to people and fooled them into liking him, trusting him. He talked to them while he was killing them, torturing and turning the knife. It was only when there was no one to talk to that he whistled, which was why he did so after a murder…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天清晨，维也纳的空气在列车车窗上凝成水雾。当人们毫无觉察地照常去上班时，一位杀手正哼着他喜欢的曲调。他买了票，礼貌地向售票员和同行乘客问好。他甚至把座位让给了一位年长的女士，并和一位高谈美国赛马的赌徒相谈甚欢。不管怎么说，吹口哨的人喜欢闲聊。他总是与人闲聊，骗得好感和信任。就算是杀人的时候，转动刀子折磨他们的时候，他也和他们聊天。没有人和他聊天时，他才吹口哨，所以他总在杀人后吹口哨…">查看中文翻译</div>

As she hovered above him, she couldn't help herself. "Come on, Max," she whispered, and even the sound of Mama's arrival at her back did not stop her from silently crying. It didn't stop her from pulling a lump of salt water from her eye and feeding it onto Max Vandenburg's face.</div>
