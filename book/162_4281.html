<div class="line_en">Just looking at his shoulders when he happened to be going over his manuscript in his heaven made me wonder where they'd been last night. How effortless and free the movement of his shoulder blades each time he shifted, how thoughtlessly they caught the sun. Did they taste of the sea to the woman who had lain under him last night and bitten into him? Or of his suntan lotion? Or of the smell that had risen from his sheets when I went into them?</div>

<div class="line_en">Toward the end of July things finally came to a head. It seemed clear that after Chiara there had been a succession of cotte, crushes, mini-crushes, one-night crushes, flings, who knows. To me all of it boiled down to one thing only: his cock had been everywhere in B. Every girl had touched it, that cock of his. It had been in who knows how many vaginas, how many mouths. The image amused me. It never bothered me to think of him between a girl's legs as she lay facing him, his broad, tanned, glistening shoulders moving up and down as I'd imagined him that afternoon when I too had wrapped my legs around his pillow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约七月底，事情终于发展到一发不可收拾的地步。显然在奇亚拉之后，还有一连串迷恋、热恋、迷你恋、一夜恋、不羁恋，天晓得是什么恋。对我来说，一切只归结于一件事：他的命根子游遍了B城，每个女孩都碰过，天晓得他的那货进入过多少女人的身体。那景象简直逗乐了我。我从来懒得去想他趴在那些女孩双腿间的样子，就像那天下午我也曾以双腿夹住他的枕头，想象他宽阔、晒黑、闪闪发光的肩膀在我下方摆动一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Did I want to be like him? Did I want to be him? Or did I just want to have him? Or are "being" and "having" thoroughly inaccurate verbs in the twisted skein of desire, where having someone's body to touch and being that someone we're longing to touch are one and the same, just opposite banks on a river that passes from us to them, back to us and over to them again in this perpetual circuit where the chambers of the heart, like the trapdoors of desire, and the wormholes of time, and the false-bottomed drawer we call identity share a beguiling logic according to which the shortest distance between real life and the life unlived, between who we are and what we want, is a twisted staircase designed with the impish cruelty of M. C. Escher. When had they separated us, you and me, Oliver? And why did I know it, and why didn't you? Is it your body that I want when I think of lying next to it every night or do I want to slip into it and own it as if it were my own, as I did when I put on your bathing suit and took it off again, all the while craving, as I craved nothing more in my life that afternoon, to feel you slip inside me as if my entire body were your bathing suit, your home? You in me, me in you…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想要像他一样吗？我想成为他吗？或者我只是想拥有他？在欲望纠缠的捆束中，“成为”和“拥有”是完全错误的动词吗？“能抚触某个人的身体”和“成为我们想抚触的对象”，是一致而相同的，就像一条河的两岸，从我们到他们，回到我们，再到他们，在这永恒循环中，每个心室就像欲望的闸门、时间的蛀孔和我们称为认同作用的夹层抽屉，共有一种虚假而迷人的逻辑。根据这个逻辑，真实人生与未活过的人生，我们是谁与欲望的对象之间最短的距离，是以艾雪①顽童般的残酷所设计的旋转楼梯。奥利弗，你和我何时被这些东西分开了？为什么我知道，而你不知道？我每晚想象躺在你身边时，想要的是你的身体吗？就像我套上你的泳裤又脱掉，始终心怀渴望；就像那天下午，超乎我这一生对任何事物的渴望，希望感觉你钻进我体内，仿佛我整个躯体是你的泳衣、你的故乡？我中有你，你中有我…【注：①艾雪：荷兰平面艺术家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On our way, I noticed that Oliver was taking his time. He wasn't in his usual rush, no speeding, no scaling the hill with his usual athletic zeal. Nor did he seem in a rush to go back to his paperwork, or join his friends on the beach, or, as was usually the case, ditch me. Perhaps he had nothing better to do. This was my moment in heaven and, young as I was, I knew it wouldn't last and that I should at least enjoy it for what it was rather than ruin it with my oft-cranked resolution to firm up our friendship or take it to another plane. There'll never be a friendship, I thought, this is nothing, just a minute of grace.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I waited, I took both our bikes and walked them toward the war memorial dedicated to the youth of the town who'd perished in the Battle of the Piave during the First World War. Every small town in Italy has a similar memorial. Two small buses had just stopped nearby and were unloading passengers -- older women arriving from the adjoining villages to shop in town. Around the small piazza, the old folk, men mostly, sat on small, rickety, straw-backed chairs or on park benches wearing drab, old, dun-colored suits. I wondered how many people here still re membered the young men they'd lost on the Piave River. You'd have to be at least eighty years old today to have known them. And at least one hundred, if not more, to have been older than they were then. At one hundred, surely you learn to overcome loss and grief -- or do they hound you till the bitter end? At one hundred, siblings forget, sons forget, loved ones forget, no one remembers anything, even the most devastated forget to remember. Mothers and fathers have long since died. Does anyone remember?</div>

Look away because that steely gaze of his always reminded me of how tall he stood and how far below him I ranked.

<div class="line_en">"Let's see, then --" And before I knew it, he sidled up to me. We were too close, I thought, I'd never been so close to him except in a dream or when he cupped his hand to light my cigarette. If he brought his ear any closer he'd hear my heart. I'd seen it written in novels but never believed it until now. He stared me right in the face, as though he liked my face and wished to study it and to linger on it, then he touched my nether lip with his finger and let it travel left and right and right and left again and again as I lay there, watching him smile in a way that made me fear anything might happen now and there'd be no turning back, that this was his way of asking, and here was my chance to say no or to say something and play for time, so that I might still debate the matter with myself, now that it had reached this point -- except that I didn't have any time left, because he brought his lips to my mouth, a warm, conciliatory, I'll-meet-you-halfway-but-no-further kiss till he realized how famished mine was. I wished I knew how to calibrate my kiss the way he did. But passion allows us to hide more, and at that moment on Monet's berm, if I wished to hide everything about me in this kiss, I was also desperate to forget the kiss by losing myself in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那，我们试试看…”我还没回过神儿来，他已经偷偷靠近我。靠太近了…除了在梦里，或他拱手替我点烟之外，我从没离他这么近过。如果他耳朵再近一点，就能听见我的心跳声。我在小说里看过这种事，可是直到现在才相信。他凝视我的脸，仿佛很喜欢我的脸，想要加以研究，依恋不舍，接着他伸出手指描摹我的下唇，从左到右，再从右到左，一次又一次来回游移，我躺着，看他露出微笑，那微笑令我害怕当下可能发生什么无法回头的事。或许这是他提问的方式，好让我现在有机会拒绝或说些什么来拖延时间。这样一来，我或许还能自我辩解，既然都到了这个节骨眼上…只是我没时间了，他已经把他的嘴唇贴到我嘴上，给我一个温暖、安抚、“我迎合你但仅此而已”的吻，直到他发现我的吻有多饥渴。但愿我知道如何像他一样节制自己的吻。但热情却能让我们隐藏更多。那一刻在莫奈的崖径上，我想把关于我的一切隐藏在这个吻里，我也渴望自己迷失在这个吻里，好忘记这个吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not answer but lifted my face to his and kissed him again, almost savagely, not because I was filled with passion or even because his kiss still lacked the zeal I was looking for, but because I was not so sure our kiss had convinced me of anything about myself. I was not even sure I had enjoyed it as much as I'd expected and needed to test it again, so that even in the act itself, I needed to test the test. My mind was drifting to the most mundane things. So much denial? a two-bit disciple of Freud would have observed. 1 squelched my doubts with a yet more violent kiss. I did not want passion, I did not want pleasure. Perhaps I didn't even want proof. And I did not want words, small talk, big talk, bike talk, book talk, any of it. Just the sun, the grass, the occasional sea breeze, and the smell of his body fresh from his chest, from his neck and his armpits. Just take me and molt me and turn me inside out, till, like a character in Ovid, I become one with your lust, that's what I wanted. Give me a blindfold, hold my hand, and don't ask me to think -- will you do that for me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没回答，只是抬起脸又吻他一次，动作几乎野蛮，不是因为充满激情，甚至不是因为他的吻仍缺乏我所追求的那种热情，而是因为我不确定我们的吻是否让我更相信自己一点。我甚至不确定我是否如同先前期待的那般乐在其中。我要再试一次，即使那个行动本身已把答案揭晓，我都需要再试一次。我的心正往最世俗的事飘去。这么强烈的否认？弗洛伊德的三脚猫门徒肯定会下此论断。我用一个更猛烈的吻压制我的疑问。我不要激情。我不要快感。或许我连证据也不想要。我不要言语、闲聊、吹嘘、谈单车、谈书，通通不要。只要太阳、草地、偶尔吹来的海风，只要从他的胸部、头颈、腋窝散发出来的体味。请占有我，让我蜕去旧有的自己，彻底改变，直到如同奥维德④诗歌里的角色一般，与你的色欲合而为一。这才是我想要的。给我一条蒙眼布，握着我的手，别要求我思考——你愿意为我这么做吗？【注：④奥维德（Publius ovidius Naso，43B.C。一 A.D。17）：罗马诗人。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not know where all this was leading, but I was surrendering to him, inch by inch, and he must have known it, for I sensed he was still keeping a distance between us. Even with our faces touching, our bodies were angles apart. I knew that anything I did now, any movement I'd make, might disturb the harmony of the moment. So, sensing there was probably not going to be a sequel to our kiss, I began to test the eventual separation of our mouths, only to realize, now that I was making mere motions of ending the kiss, how much I'd wanted it not to stop, wanted his tongue in my mouth and mine in his -- because all we had become, after all these weeks and all the strife and all the fits and starts that ushered a chill draft each time, was just two wet tongues flailing away in each other's mouths. Just two tongues, all the rest was nothing. When, finally, I lifted one knee and moved it toward him to face him, I knew I had broken the spell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道这一切将往何处发展，但我逐渐臣服于他，一寸一寸，他必定也知道，因为我感觉到他仍在我们之间维持一段距离。即使我们的脸碰在一起，我们的身体却未曾贴合。我知道现在做任何事、任何动作都可能扰乱此刻的和谐。因此，意识到我们的吻可能不会再续，我试着让我的唇离开他的，却发现我多么不想结束这个吻，我希望他的舌头在我嘴里，我的也在他嘴里；经过这些日子所有的不愉快以及间歇的冷战，我们变成胡乱在彼此嘴里搅动的潮湿舌头。只是舌头而已，其他毫无意义。最后，就在我抬起一边的膝盖移向他、面对他的时候，我知道我已经打破魔咒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was my foot that had strayed and touched his. It withdrew, not immediately, but soon enough, as though it had consciously waited an appropriate interval of time so as not to give the impression of having recoiled in panic. I too waited a few seconds more and, without actually planning my move, allowed my foot to begin seeking the other out. I had just begun searching for it when my toe suddenly bumped into his foot; his had hardly budged at all, like a pirate ship that gave every indication of having fled miles away but was really hiding in a fog no more than fifty yards away, waiting to pounce as soon as the chance presented itself. I had barely enough time to do anything with my foot when, without warning, without giving me time to work my way to his or to let mine rest at a safe distance again, softly, gently, suddenly his foot moved over to mine and began caressing it, rubbing it, never holding still, the smooth round ball of his heel holding my foot in place, occasionally bringing its weight to bear but lightening it right away with another caress of the toes, indicating, all the while, that this was being done in the spirit of fun and games, because it was his way of pulling the rug out from under the lunch drudges sitting right across from us, but also telling me that this had nothing to do with others and would remain strictly between us, because it was about us, but that I shouldn't read into it more than there was. The stealth and stubbornness of his caresses sent chills down my spine. A sudden giddiness overtook me. No, I wasn't going to cry, this wasn't a panic attack, it wasn't a "swoon," and I wasn't going to come in my shorts either, though I liked this very, very much, especially when the arch of his foot lay on top of my foot. When I looked at my dessert plate and saw the chocolate cake speckled with raspberry juice, it seemed to me that someone was pouring more and more red sauce than usual, and that the sauce seemed to be coming from the ceiling above my head until it suddenly hit me that it was streaming from my nose. I gasped, and quickly crumpled my napkin and brought it to my nose, holding my head as far back as I could. "Ghiaccio, ice, Mafalda, per favore, presto' I said, softly, to show that I was in perfect control of the situation. "I was up at the hill this morning. Happens all the time," I said, apologizing to the guests.</div>

Without saying a word, I strained to make out the outline of the bathrobe I had worn so many times after he'd used it, its long terrycloth belt hanging so close to me now, rubbing my cheek ever so lightly as he stood there ready to let the robe drop to the floor. Had he come barefoot? And had he locked my door? Was he as hard as I was, and was his cock already pushing out of the bathrobe, which was why the belt was just about caressing my face, was he doing it on purpose, tickling me in the face, don't stop, don't stop, don't ever stop.

After lunch, he said he would take a nap -- the first, and last, during his entire stay with us. And indeed he did nap, because when he woke up at around five, he looked as flush as someone who had lost ten years of his life: ruddy cheeks, eyes all rested, the gauntness gone. He could have passed for my age. As promised, that night we all sat down -- there were no guests -- and watched television romances. The best part was how everyone, including Vimini, who wandered in, and Mafalda, who had her "seat" near the door of the living room, talked back to every scene, predicted its end, by turns outraged by and derisive of the stupidity of the story, the actors, the characters.

Everyone volunteered to fill him in on the plot at the same time, including my father, whose version of what Oliver had missed was less accurate than Mafalda's. There was a lot of noise, with the result that we missed more of the film than Oliver had during his brief call. Much laughter. At some point, while we were intently focused on the high drama, Anchise walked into the living room and, unrolling a soaking old T-shirt, produced the evening's catch: a gigantic sea bass, instantly destined for tomorrow's lunch and dinner, with plenty for everyone who cared to join in.

So we lingered on the piazzetta, I staring at the war memorial, he looking out at the view of the speckling bay, neither of us saying a word about Shelley's ghost, which shadowed our every step through town and beckoned louder than Hamlet's father. Without thinking, he asked how anyone could drown in such a sea. I smiled right away, because I caught his attempt to backpedal, which instantly brought complicit smiles to our faces, like a passionate wet kiss in the midst of a conversation between two individuals who, without thinking, had reached for each other's lips through the scorching red desert both had intentionally placed between them so as not to grope for each other's nakedness.</div>

Better yet, I wanted someone to look through his books one day, open up this tiny volume of Armance, and ask, Tell me who was in silence, somewhere in Italy in the mid-eighties? And then I'd want him to feel something as darting as sorrow and fiercer than regret, maybe even pity for me, because in the bookstore that morning I'd have taken pity too, if pity was all he had to give, if pity could have made him put an arm around me, and underneath this surge of pity and regret, hovering like a vague, erotic undercurrent that was years in the making, I wanted him to remember the morning on Monet's berm when I'd kissed him not the first but the second time and given him my spit in his mouth because I so desperately wanted his in mine.</div>

I'm sure that if I had looked at him then, we would have exchanged the same infectious smile we'd immediately wiped off our faces on bringing up Shelley's death. It might have brought us closer, if only to remind us how far apart we needed to be now. Perhaps in looking the other way, and knowing we had looked the other way to avoid "speeches," we might have found a reason to smile at each other, for I'm sure he knew I knew he knew I was avoiding all mention of Monet's berm, and that this avoidance, which gave every indication of drawing us apart, was, instead, a perfectly synchronized moment of intimacy which neither of us wished to dispel.

<div class="line_en">The trip wire loomed at all hours of the night. An owl, the sound of Oliver's own window shutters squeaking against the wind, the music from a distant, all-night discotheque in an adjoining hill town, the scuffling of cats very late at night, or the creak of the wooden lintel of my bedroom door, anything could wake me. But I'd known these since childhood and, like a sleeping fawn flicking his tail at an intrusive insect, knew how to brush them away and fall instantly back to sleep. Sometimes, though, a mere nothing, like a sense of dread or shame, would slip its way out of my sleep and hover undefined about me and watch me sleep and, bending down to my ear, finally whisper, I'm not trying to wake you, I'm really not, go back to sleep, Elio, keep sleeping -- while I made every effort to recover the dream I was about to reenter any moment now and could almost rescript if only I tried a bit harder.</div>

There they were, the legacy of youth, the two mascots of my life, hunger and fear, watching over me, saying, So many before you have taken the chance and been rewarded, why can't you? No answer.

<div class="line_en">That night, yet again, an answer did come, though it came in a dream that was itself a dream within a dream. I awoke with an image that told me more than I wanted to know, as though, de- spite all of my frank admissions to myself about what I wanted from him, and how I'd want it, there were still a few corners I'd avoided. In this dream I finally learned what my body must have known from the very first day. We were in his room, and, contrary to all my fantasies, it was not I who had my back on the bed, but Oliver; I was on top of him, watching, on his face, an expression at once so flushed, so readily acquiescent, that even in my sleep it tore every emotion out of me and told me one thing I could never have known or guessed so far: that not to give what I was dying to give him at whatever price was perhaps the greatest crime I might ever commit in my life. I desperately wanted to give him something. By contrast, taking seemed so bland, so facile, so mechanical. And then I heard it, as I knew by now I would. "You'll kill me if you stop," he was gasping, conscious that he'd already spoken these selfsame words to me a few nights before in another dream but that, having said them once, he was also free to repeat them whenever he came into my dreams, even though neither of us seemed to know whether it was his voice that was breaking from inside me or whether my memory of these very words was exploding in him. His face, which seemed both to endure my passion and by doing so to abet it, gave me an image of kindness and fire I had never seen and could never have imagined on anyone's face before. This very image of him would become like a night-light in my life, keeping vigil on those days when I'd all but given up, rekindling my desire for him when I wanted it dead, stoking the embers of courage when I feared a snub might dispel every semblance of pride. The look on his face became like the tiny snapshot of a beloved that soldiers take with them to the battlefield, not only to remember there are good things in life and that happiness awaits them, but to remind themselves that this face might never forgive them for coming back in a body bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，答案真的再度来访，尽管它出现在一个本身就是梦中梦的梦里。某个意象唤醒我，它告诉我的，比我想知道的还多；尽管我对自己坦承想从奥利弗那儿得到什么、我多么想要，却仍有几个角落是我回避的。在这个梦里，我总算知道我的身体打从第一天起就铁定知道的事。我们在他房里，而且，与我所有的幻想相反，躺在床上的人不是我，而是奥利弗；我在他上面，看着；他面色潮红，一脸慨然应允的表情。尽管在我睡梦中，我的感情还是全被撕扯下来，我也因此知道一件截至目前不可能知道或猜到的事：不把我渴望不计代价给予的东西给他，或许是我这辈子所犯下最严重的罪行。我拼命想给他一些什么，相对于此，“接受”似乎是那么稀松平常、那么轻而易举、那么机械化。接着我听到那句话，那句我早预见我要听到的。“如果你胆敢停下来，还不如先杀了我。”他喘着气，意识到几天前的晚上，他已在另一个梦里对我说过相同的话。但既然说过一次，每次再到我梦中，他仍然能够自由重复这句话，虽然我们似乎都不知道那是他从我体内发出来的声音，或是我对这几个字的记忆在他体内爆开来。他的脸似乎在忍受我热情的同时，也借着此举来煽动我的热情，给我一张仁慈与火焰的意象，那是我过去未曾在任何人脸上见过也绝对想象不到的。正是他的这个意象，有如我生命中的一盏夜灯，在我几乎放弃的日子里静静守护；在我宁愿我对他的欲望枯死时，重新点燃；在我害怕一个怠慢可能驱散每一个像是自尊的假象时，为勇气的余烬添加柴火。他脸上的表情好似士兵带上战场的心上人快照，不仅为了记得人生中有美好的事物，幸福正在家乡等待，也为了提醒自己，心上人绝对不原谅他们躺在运尸袋里回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

When I offered him the book in the bookstore, and later even insisted on being the one to pay for our ice cream because buying an ice cream also meant walking our bikes through the narrow, shaded lanes of B. and therefore being together awhile longer, it was also to thank him for giving me "You'll kill me if you stop." Even when I ribbed him and promised to make no speeches, it was because I was secretly cradling "You'll kill me if you stop"-- far more precious now than any other admission from him. That morning, I'd written it down in my diary but omitted to say I had dreamt it. I wanted to come back years later and believe, if only for a moment, that he had truly spoken these pleading words to me. What I wanted to preserve was the turbulent gasp in his voice which lingered with me for days afterward and told me that, if I could have him like this in my dreams every night of my life, I'd stake my entire life on dreams and be done with the rest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Marzia met me in her garden. She was seated on an old, wrought-iron chair, her legs extended in front of her, with just her heels touching the ground. Her bike was leaning against another chair, its handlebar almost touching the ground. She was wearing a sweater. You made me wait a lot, she said. We left her house via a shortcut that was steeper but that brought us to town in no time. The light and the sound of bustling nightlife from the piazzetta were brimming over into the side alleys. One of the restaurants was in the habit of taking out tiny wooden tables and putting them on the sidewalk whenever its clientele overflowed the allotted space on the square. When we entered the piazza the bustle and commotion filled me with the usual sense of anxiety and inadequacy. Marzia would run into friends, others were bound to tease. Even being with her would challenge me in one way or another. I didn't want to be challenged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛琪雅在她家花园等我。她坐在一张老旧的锻铁椅子上，两腿向前伸，只有脚后跟着地。她的脚踏车靠在另一张椅子上，把手几乎碰到地面。她穿了一件长袖运动衫。你常常让我等呢，她说。我们抄近路离开她家，那条路比较陡，不过一下子就到城区了。小广场夜生活喧嚣的声光满溢在巷弄里。其中一间餐厅每当广场的座位区客满，就搬出小木桌放在人行道上。来到露天市场，喧闹和骚动让我充满惯有的焦虑和自卑。玛琪雅可能会与朋友不期而遇，其他人一定会取笑。即使跟她在一起，对我来说也是某种挑战。我不想被挑战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I decided to call a friend to ask if he was headed to town. His mother replied that he'd already left, and yes, had probably gone to the same place as well. I called another. He too had already left. My father said, "Why don't you call Marzia? Are you avoiding her?" Not avoiding -- but she seemed full of complications. "As if you aren't!" he added. When I called she said she wasn't going anywhere tonight. There was a dusky chill in her voice. I was calling to apologize. "I heard you were sick." It was nothing, I replied. I could come and pick her up by bike, and together we'd ride to B. She said she'd join me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我决定打电话问朋友要不要一起进城。朋友的母亲回答说他已经离开，没错，可能也是去同一个地方。我又打给另一个，他也已经走了。父亲问：“为什么不打电话给玛琪雅，你躲她？”不是躲，可是她似乎很复杂。“你自己就不复杂呀？”他补了一句。我打电话给玛琪雅，她说她今晚哪儿都不去，声音里有一股阴郁的冷淡。我打电话是为了道歉。“听说你病了？”那没什么，我回答。我可以骑脚踏车去接她，然后一起骑车去B城。她说她会跟我去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, with our ice-cream cones, we began to walk casually through the crowded piazzetta, threading our way along one street, then another, and still another. I liked it when cobblestones glistened in the dark, liked the way she and I ambled about lazily as we walked our bikes through town, listening to the muffled chatter of TV stations coming from behind open windows. The bookstore was still open, and I asked her if she minded. No, she didn't mind, she'd come in with me. We leaned our bikes against the wall. The beaded fly curtain gave way to a smoky, musty room littered with overbrimming ashtrays. The owner was thinking of closing soon, but the Schubert quartet was still playing and a couple in their mid-twenties, tourists, were thumbing through books in the English-language section, probably looking for a novel with local color. How different from that morning when there hadn't been a soul about and blinding sunlight and the smell of fresh coffee had filled the shop. Marzia looked over my shoulder while I picked up a book of poetry on the table and began to read one of the poems. I was about to turn the page when she said she hadn't finished reading yet. I liked this. Seeing the couple next to us about to purchase an Italian novel in translation, I interrupted their conversation and advised against it. "This is much, much better. It's set in Sicily, not here, but it's probably the best Italian novel written this century."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们拿着卷筒冰淇淋漫无目的地穿过拥挤的小广场，在巷弄间闲晃。我喜欢鹅卵石在黑暗中闪闪发光的样子，喜欢和她闲散地牵着脚踏车走过城镇，听敞开的窗户里边传来电视闷闷的聒噪声。书店还开着，我问她是否介意。不，她不介意，她愿意跟我一起进去。我们把脚踏车靠墙停放，撩开书店门口的珠帘，走进烟雾袅绕、满是霉味的店内，烟灰缸里的烟灰都满出来了。老板说就快打烊，可是店里仍播着舒伯特的四重奏，一对二十五六岁的男女旅客迅速浏览英文书区，或许想找有地方色彩的小说吧。这一夜的书店，与四下无人、阳光炫目、弥漫清爽咖啡香的那个早晨多么不同啊。我拿起桌上的诗集读起其中一首诗，玛琪雅站在我后面看。我正要翻页，她说她还没读完。我喜欢这种感觉。看到我们旁边的情侣正准备买一本意大利小说翻译本，我打断他们的交谈，建议他们别买。“这本好很多、很多。虽然背景设定在西西里而不是这里，却可能是本世纪最棒的意大利小说。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two other young adults, wearing stylish summer sports jackets, without ties, were discussing literature with the owner, all three of them smoking. On the table next to the cashier stood a clutter of mostly emptied wine glasses, and next to them one large bottle of port. The tourists, I noticed, were holding emptied glasses. Obviously, they'd been offered wine during the book party. The owner looked over to us and with a silent glance that wished to apologize for interrupting asked if we wanted some port as well. I looked at Marzia and shrugged back, meaning, She doesn't seem to want to. The owner, still silent, pointed to the bottle and shook his head in mock disapproval, to suggest it was a pity to throw away such good port tonight, so why not help him finish it before closing the shop. I finally accepted, as did Marzia. Out of politeness, I asked what was the book being celebrated tonight. Another man, whom I hadn't noticed because he'd been reading something in the tiny alcove, named the book: Se l'amore. If Love. "Is it good?" I asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We've seen the movie," said the girl. "Is it as good as Calvino, though?" I shrugged my shoulders. Marzia was still interested in the same poem and was actually rereading it. "Calvino is nothing in comparison -- lint and tinsel. But I'm just a kid, and what do I know?"</div>

She took her bike, placed it against the door of a closed shop, and, leaning against a wall, said, "Kiss me again?" Using my kickstand, I stood the bike in the middle of the alley and, once we were close, I held her face with both hands, then leaned into her as we began to kiss, my hands under her shirt, hers in my hair. I loved her simplicity, her candor. It was in every word she'd spoken to me that night -- untrammeled, frank, human -- and in the way her hips responded to mine now, without inhibition, without exaggeration, as though the connection between lips and hips in her body was fluid and instantaneous. A kiss on the mouth was not a prelude to a more comprehensive contact, it was already contact in its totality. There was nothing between our bodies but our clothes, which was why I was not caught by surprise when she slipped a hand between us and down into my trousers, and said, "Set duro, duro, you're so hard." And it was her frankness, unfettered and unstrained, that made me harder yet now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, as I made my way home, I loved her smell on my body, on my hands. I would do nothing to wash it away. I'd keep it on me till we met in the evening. Part of me still enjoyed luxuriating in this newfound, beneficent wave of indifference, verging on distaste, for Oliver that both pleased me and told me how fickle I ultimately was. Perhaps he sensed that all I'd wanted from him was to sleep with him to be done with him and had instinctively resolved to have nothing to do with me. To think that a few nights ago I had felt so strong an urge to host his body in mine that I'd nearly jumped out of bed to seek him out in his room. Now the idea couldn't possibly arouse me. Perhaps this whole thing with Oliver had been canicular rut, and I was well rid of it. By contrast, all I had to do was smell Marzia on my hand and I loved the all-woman in every woman.</div>

By then, everyone had left for le vacanze, and the occasional tourists were usually gone before seven in the evening. I loved the afternoons best: the scent of rosemary, the heat, the birds, the cicadas, the sway of palm fronds, the silence that fell like a light linen shawl on an appallingly sunny day, all of these highlighted by the walk down to the shore and the walk back upstairs to shower. I liked looking up to our house from the tennis court and seeing the empty balconies bask in the sun, knowing that from any one of them you could spot the limitless sea. This was my balcony, my world. From where I sat now, I could look around me and say, Here is our tennis court, there our garden, our orchard, our shed, our house, and below is our wharf -- everyone and everything I care for is here.

<div class="line_en">At dinner, our guests were a semi-employed adjunct professor of music and a gay couple from Chicago who insisted on speaking terrible Italian. The two men sat next to each other, facing my mother and me. One of them decided to recite some verses by Pascoli, to which Mafalda, catching my look, made her usual smorfia meant to elicit a giggle from me. My father had warned me not to misbehave in the presence of the scholars from Chicago. I said I would wear the purple shirt given me by a distant cousin from Uruguay. My father laughed it off, saying I was too old not to accept people as they were. But there was a glint in his eyes when both showed up wearing purple shirts. They had both stepped out from either side of the cab at the same time and each carried a bunch of white flowers in his hand. They looked, as my father must have realized, like a flowery, gussied-up version of Tintin's Thomson and Thompson twins.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was absolutely nothing to say. With my toes, I reached over to his toes and touched them. Then, without thinking, I slipped my big toe in between his big toe and his second toe. He did not recoil, he did not respond. 1 wanted to touch each toe with my own. Since I was sitting to his left, these were probably not the toes that had touched me at lunch the other day. It was his right foot that was guilty. I tried to reach it with my right foot, all the while avoiding touching both his knees, as if something told me knees were off bounds. "What are you doing?" he finally asked. "Nothing." I didn't know myself, but his body gradually began to reciprocate the movement, somewhat absentmindedly, without conviction, no less awkward than mine, as if to say, What else is there to do but to respond in kind when someone touches your toes with his toes? After that, I moved closer to him and then hugged him. A child's hug which I hoped he'd read as an embrace. He did not respond. "That's a start," he finally said, perhaps with a tad more humor in his voice than I'd wish. Instead of speaking, I shrugged my shoulders, hoping he'd feel my shrug and not ask any more questions. I did not want us to speak. The less we spoke, the more unrestrained our movements. I liked hugging him.</div>

<div class="line_en">I decided to get under the covers. I loved the smell. I wanted to love the smell.

<div class="line_en">I did not give him an answer. Without nodding, I had already brought my mouth to his, just as I'd kissed Marzia the night before. Something unexpected seemed to clear away between us, and, for a second, it seemed there was absolutely no difference in age between us, just two men kissing, and even this seemed to dissolve, as I began to feel we were not even two men, just two beings. I loved the egalitarianism of the moment. I loved feeling younger and older, human to human, man to man, Jew to Jew. I loved the night-light. It made me feel snug and safe. As I'd felt that night in the hotel bedroom in Oxford. I even loved the stale, wan feel of my old bedroom, which was littered with his things but which somehow became more livable under his stewardship than mine: a picture here, a chair turned into an end table, books, cards, music.</div>

<div class="line_en">He got under the covers too and, before I knew it, started to undress me. I had worried about how I'd go about undressing, how, if he wasn't going to help, I'd do what so many girls did in the movies, take off my shirt, drop my pants, and just stand there, stark-naked, arms hanging down, meaning: This is who I am, this is how I'm made, here, take me, I'm yours. But his move had solved the problem. He was whispering, "Off, and off, and off, and off," which made me laugh, and suddenly I was totally naked, feeling the weight of the sheet on my cock, not a secret left in the world, because wanting to be in bed with him was my only secret and here I was sharing it with him. How wonderful to feel his hands all over me under the sheets, as if part of us, like an advance scouting party, had already arrived at intimacy, while the rest of us, exposed outside the sheets, was still struggling with niceties, like latecomers stamping their feet in the cold while everyone else is warming hands inside a crowded nightclub. He was still dressed and I wasn't. I loved being naked before him. Then he kissed me, and kissed me again, deeply this second time, as if he too was finally letting go. At some point I realized he'd been naked for a long while, though I hadn't noticed him undress, but there he was, not a part of him wasn't touching me. Where had I been? I'd been meaning to ask the tactful health question, but that too seemed to have been answered a while ago, because when I finally did find the courage to ask him, he replied, "I already told you, I'm okay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也钻进被窝，我还来不及搞清楚状况，他动手褪去我的衣服。我曾经担心该怎么宽衣解带；如果他不帮忙，我该如何像电影中的女人一样，脱掉我的衬衫，卸除我的裤子，赤裸裸垂着双臂呆站着，向他示意：这就是我，我就是这副德行，来吧，占有我，我是你的。但他解决了这个问题。他低声说：“脱，再脱，再脱，再脱。”我听了笑出来，转眼间我全身赤裸，感觉床单落在下体的重量，感觉在这个世界已经没有秘密，因为想跟他上床是我唯一的秘密，而此刻我正与他分享。感觉他伸手到床单下在我全身游移。多么美妙啊，好像一部分的我们已经抵达终点，有了亲密行为，而暴露在床单外的我们的身躯仍在跟枝微末节挣扎，仿佛其他人在拥挤的夜总会里暖手，迟到者只能在寒冷中跺脚。他还穿着衣服，我已经一丝不挂。我爱在他面前裸露。他吻我，再吻我，这第二次吻得更深，他也总算放开了。突然我发觉他也裸着身子，尽管我没注意到他何时脱光衣服。他就这样，浑身没有一处不触碰我，我神游到哪儿去了？我本来想问问得体的健康问题，但那刚刚似乎也回答了，因为当我总算鼓起勇气问他，他回我说：“我告诉你了，我没问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes." He smiled. I looked away, because he was staring at me, and I knew I was flushed, and I knew I'd made a face, though I still wanted him to stare at me even if it embarrassed me, and I wanted to keep staring at him too as we settled in our mock wrestling position, his shoulders rubbing my knees. How far we had come from the afternoon when I'd taken off my underwear and put on his bathing suit and thought this was the closest his body would ever come to mine. Now this. I was on the cusp of something, but I also wanted it to last forever, because I knew there'd be no coming back from this. When it happened, it happened not as I'd dreamed it would, but with a degree of discomfort that forced me to reveal more of myself than I cared to reveal. I had an impulse to stop him, and when he noticed, he did ask, but I did not answer, or didn't know what to answer, and an eternity seemed to pass between my reluctance to make up my mind and his instinct to make it up for me. From this moment on, I thought, from this moment on -- I had, as I'd never before in my life, the distinct feeling of arriving somewhere very dear, of wanting this forever, of being me, me, me, me, and no one else, just me, of finding in each shiver that ran down my arms something totally alien and yet by no means unfamiliar, as if all this had been part of me all of my life and I'd misplaced it and he had helped me find it. The dream had been right -- this was like coming home, like asking, Where have I been all my life? which was another way of asking, Where were you in my childhood, Oliver? which was yet another way of asking, What is life without this? which was why, in the end, it was I, and not he, who blurted out, not once, but many, many times, You'll kill me if you stop, you'll kill me if you stop, because it was also my way of bringing full circle the dream and the fantasy, me and him, the longed-for words from his mouth to my mouth back into his mouth, swapping words from mouth to mouth, which was when I must have begun using obscenities that he repeated after me, softly at first, till he said, "Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine," which I'd never done in my life before and which, as soon as I said my own name as though it were his, took me to a realm I never shared with anyone in my life before, or since.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说过了。”他微笑。我睁开眼，因为他正盯着我看，我知道我脸很红，也知道我做了鬼脸，尽管觉得不好意思，还是希望他盯着我看。等他的肩膀摩擦我的膝盖时，我也想一直盯着他看。距离那天下午，我脱掉内裤穿上他的泳裤，心想这是他和我身体最接近的距离那时，我们走了多远？现在竟然发生这种事。我在顶点上，希望这状态能永远持续，因为我知道这是一条不归路。事情发生了，情况不如我梦想的那样，反而有些不舒服，逼得我得暴露更多的自己。我有一种想阻止他的冲动。他注意到了，也问我要不要停，但我没回答，或许不知道该回答什么。在我不情愿下定决心和他直觉想补偿我之际，时间仿佛无尽延长。从这一刻起，从这一刻起，仿佛我这一生从未有过，我到达了某个非常心爱的地方，感觉对此永不满足，感觉成为我、我、我、我，而不是其他人，就只是我。感觉发现贯通手臂的每个哆嗦都有些陌生，却绝非不熟悉的东西，仿佛这一切在我一生中都曾经是我的一部分，曾经被我忘在哪里，而他帮我找回来了。那个梦是对的——这就像归乡，像在问“我这辈子都在做什么呀”，等于拐个弯问“我小时候你在哪儿，奥利弗？”也就是“少了这个，人生算什么”。所以，到头来，脱口而出的是我，不是他；不仅一次，而是许多许多次；如果你胆敢停下来，还不如先杀了我；如果你胆敢停下来，还不如先杀了我。这也是我让梦与幻想绕一大圈之后回到原点的方式，我和他，渴望的话语从他嘴里到我嘴里，再回到他嘴里，在嘴与嘴之间交换文字。必定就是在这个时候，我开始用他跟着我重复的淫言秽语，一开始说得很轻，直到他说：“用你的名字呼唤我，我也用我的名字呼唤你。”我这辈子从来没做过这种事，就在我把我的名当他的名来唤时，我进入了一种无论过去或此后，我从未与任何人共享的境界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It must have come to me a while later when I was still in his arms. It woke me up before I even realized I had dozed off, filling me with a sense of dread and anxiety I couldn't begin to fathom. I felt queasy, as if I had been sick and needed not just many showers to wash everything off but a bath in mouthwash. I needed to be far away -- from him, from this room, from what we'd done together. It was as though I were slowly landing from an awful nightmare but wasn't quite touching the ground yet and wasn't sure I wanted to, because what awaited was not going to be much better, though I knew I couldn't go on hanging on to that giant, amorphous blob of a nightmare that felt like the biggest cloud of self-loathing and remorse that had ever wafted into my life. I would never be the same. How had I let him do these things to me, and how eagerly had I participated in them, and spurred them on, and then waited for him, begging him, Please don't stop. Now his goo was matted on my chest as proof that I had crossed a terrible line, not vis-à-vis those I held dearest, not even vis-à-vis myself, or anything sacred, or the race itself that had brought us this close, not even vis-à-vis Marzia, who stood now like a far-flung siren on a sinking reef, distant and irrelevant, cleansed by lapping summer waves while I struggled to swim out to her, clamoring from a whirlpool of anxiety in the hope that she'd be part of the collection of images to help me rebuild myself by daybreak. It was not these I had offended, but those who were yet unborn or unmet and whom I'd never be able to love without remembering this mass of shame and revulsion rising between my life and theirs. It would haunt and sully my love for them, and between us, there would be this secret that could tarnish everything good in me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一定是过了一阵子之后、但还在他臂弯里时想起来的。甚至在我意识到我睡着之前，这件事让我醒来，让我心中充满难以领会的害怕与焦虑。我想吐，仿佛我病了，不仅需要好好冲个澡洗掉一切，还需要以漱口水泡澡。我得离开——远离他，远离这个房间，远离我们一起做的事。有如缓缓从一个可怕的梦魔登陆，但还没完全着地，也不确定想登陆。明白我不能继续跟巨大杂乱的一团梦魔纠缠不休（这梦魔有如自我厌恶与悔恨组成的一朵最大的乌云飘进我生命中），但等着我的也好不了多少。我将再也不一样了。我怎能让他对我做这些事？还曾经那么热衷，火上浇油，等待他，恳求他不要停？留在我胸前的他的体液证明我通过了一条可怕的线，不是关于我最珍视的那些，甚至不是关于我自己或任何神圣的东西，或将我们拉得这么近的种族本身，甚至与玛琪雅无关——此刻她正像女海妖，站在没人水中的暗礁上，遥远而不相干，夏日波浪泼溅在她身上；我挣扎着游向他，从焦虑的漩涡中叫喊，希望她会是帮助我在破晓之前重建自我的诸多意象之一。我冒犯的不是这些，而是那些尚未诞生、未曾相遇，以及若不想起出现在我和他们生活之间这一大堆羞耻与嫌恶，便永远无法去爱的那些人。这件事将纠缠、玷污我对他们的爱，而我们之间将永远有这个能玷污我一切美德的秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think I might have sobbed even, but I wasn't sure. He took his shirt and cleaned me with it. Mafalda always looks for signs. She won't find any, he said. I call this shirt "Billowy," you wore it on your first day here, it has more of you than me. I doubt it, he said. He wouldn't let go of me yet, but as our bodies separated I seemed to remember, though ever so distantly, that a while back I had absentmindedly shoved away a book which had ended up under my back while he was still inside me. Now it was on the floor. When had I realized it was a copy of Se l'amore? Where had I found time in the heat of passion even to wonder whether he'd been to the book party on the same night I'd gone there with Marzia? Strange thoughts that seemed to drift in from long, long ago, no more than half an hour later.</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat on one of the rocks and talked. Why hadn't we talked like this before? I'd have been less desperate for him had we been able to have this kind of friendship weeks earlier. Perhaps we might have avoided sleeping together. I wanted to tell him that I had made love to Marzia the other night not two hundred yards away from where we stood right now. But I kept quiet. Instead we spoke of Haydn's "It Is Finished," which I'd just finished transcribing. I could speak about this and not feel I was doing it to impress him or to draw his attention or to put up a wobbly footbridge between us. I could speak about the Haydn for hours -- what a lovely friendship this might have been.</div>

I had wanted the sea to wash away the gunk on my chest, yet here was his semen, clinging to my body. In a short while, after soap and shower, all my doubts about myself, which had started three years before when an anonymous young man riding a bike had stopped, gotten off, put a hand around my shoulder, and with that gesture either stirred or hastened something that might have taken much, much longer to work itself to consciousness -- all these could now finally be washed away as well, dispelled as an evil rumor about me, or a false belief, released like a genie who'd served his sentence and was now being cleansed with the soft, radiant scent of chamomile soap found in every one of our bathrooms.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he came down for breakfast he was wearing my bathing suit. No one would have given it another thought since everyone was always swapping suits in our house, but this was the first time he had done so and it was the same suit I had worn that very dawn when we'd gone out for a swim. Watching him wearing my clothes was an unbearable turn-on. And he knew it. It was turning both of us on. The thought of his cock rubbing the netted fabric where mine had rested reminded me how, before my very eyes, and after so much exertion, he had finally shot his load on my chest. But what turned me on wasn't this. It was the porousness, the fungibility, of our bodies -- what was mine was suddenly his, just as what belonged to him could be all mine now. Was I being lured back again? At the table, he decided to sit at my side and, when no one was looking, slipped his foot not on top of but under mine. I knew my foot was rough from always walking barefoot; his was smooth; last night I had kissed his foot and sucked his toes; now they were snuggled under my callused foot and I needed to protect my protector.</div>

I was reminded of a married chatelaine who, after sleeping with a young vassal one night, had him seized by the palace guards the next morning and summarily executed in a dungeon on trumped-up charges, not only to eliminate all evidence of their adulterous night together and to prevent her young lover from becoming a nuisance now that he thought he was entitled to her favors, but to stem the temptation to seek him out on the following evening.

No one had ever worn my clothes. Perhaps the physical and the metaphorical meanings are clumsy ways of understanding what happens when two beings need, not just to be close together, but to become so totally ductile that each becomes the other. To be who I am because of you. To be who he was because of me. To be in his mouth while he was in mine and no longer know whose it was, his cock or mine, that was in my mouth. He was my secret conduit to myself -- like a catalyst that allows us to become who we are, the foreign body, the pacer, the graft, the patch that sends all the right impulses, the steel pin that keeps a soldier's bone together, the other man's heart that makes us more us than we were before the transplant.</div>

He laughed and said, "Later!"-- meaning exactly what I wanted it to mean for a change: not just goodbye, or be off with you, but afternoon lovemaking.

Nothing could go wrong, everything was happening my way, all the doors were clicking open one by one, and life couldn't have been more radiant: it was shining right at me, and when I turned my bike left or right or tried to move away from its light, it followed me as limelight follows an actor onstage.

<div class="line_en">On my way, I decided to stop at Marzia's house. She was headed to the beach. I joined her, and we went down to the rocks together and lay in the sun. I loved her smell, loved her mouth. She took off her top and asked me to put some suntan lotion on her back, knowing that my hands would inevitably cup her breasts. Her family owned a thatched cabana by the beach and she said we should go inside. No one would come. I locked the door from the inside, sat her on the table, took off her bathing suit, and put my mouth where she smelled of the sea. She leaned back, and lifted both legs over my shoulders. How strange, I thought, how each shadowed and screened the other, without precluding the other. Barely half an hour ago I was asking Oliver to fuck me and now here I was about to make love to Marzia, and yet neither had anything to do with the other except through Elio, who happened to be one and the same person.</div>

<div class="line_en">Half an hour later, or maybe sooner, I was awakened by the rich brown cloistral scent of coffee wafting through the house. Even with the door closed I could smell it and I knew this wasn't my parents' coffee. Theirs had been brewed and served a while ago. This was the afternoon's second brew, made in the Neapolitan espresso coffeemaker in which Mafalda, her husband, and Anchise made coffee after they too had lunched. Soon they would be resting as well. Already a heavy torpor hung in the air -- the world was falling asleep. All I wanted was for him or Marzia to pass by my balcony door and, through the half-drawn shutters, make out my naked body sprawled on the bed. Him or Marzia -- but I wanted someone to pass by and notice me, and up to them to decide what to do. I could go on sleeping or, if they should sidle up to me, I'd make room for them and we'd sleep together. I saw one of them enter my room and reach for the fruit, and with the fruit in hand, come to my bed and bring it to my hard cock. / know you're not sleeping, they'd say, and gently press the soft, overripe peach on my cock till I'd pierced the fruit along the crease that reminded me so much of Oliver's ass. The idea seized me and would not let go.</div>

<div class="line_en">After lunch Oliver said he had to go back to B. to hand Signora Milani his latest corrections. He cast an instant glance in my direction but, seeing I hadn't responded, was already on his way. After two glasses of wine, 1 couldn't wait to take a nap. I grabbed two huge peaches from the table and took them with me, and kissed my mother along the way. I'd eat them later, I said. In the dark bedroom, I deposited the fruit on the marble tabletop. And then undressed totally. Clean, cool, crisp-starched, sun-washed sheets drawn tight across my bed -- God bless you, Mafalda. Did I want to be alone? Yes. One person last night; then again at dawn. Then in the morning, another. Now I lay on the sheets as happy as a stiff-grown, newly sprung sunflower filled with listless vigor on this sunniest of summer afternoons. Was I glad to be alone now that sleep was upon me? Yes. Well, no. Yes. But maybe not. Yes, yes, yes. 1 was happy, and this was all that mattered, with others, without others, I was happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">If Anchise only knew, if Anchise knew what I was doing to the fruit he cultivated with such slavish devotion every day, him and his large straw hat and his long, gnarled, callused fingers that were always ripping out weeds from the parched earth. His peaches were more apricots than peaches, except larger, juicier. I had already tried the animal kingdom. Now I was moving to the kingdom of plants. Next would come minerals. The idea almost made me chuckle. The fruit was leaking all over my cock. If Oliver walked in on me now, I'd let him suck me as he had this morning. If Marzia came, I'd let her help me finish the job. The peach was soft and firm, and when I finally succeeded in tearing it apart with my cock, I saw that its reddened core reminded me not just of an anus but of a vagina, so that holding each half in either hand firmly against my cock, I began to rub myself, thinking of no one and of everyone, including the poor peach, which had no idea what was being done to it except that it had to play along and probably in the end took some pleasure in the act as well, till I thought I heard it say to me, Fuck me, Elio, fuck me harder, and after a moment, Harder, I said! while I scanned my mind for images from Ovid -- wasn't there a character who had turned into a peach and, if there wasn't, couldn't I make one up on the spot, say, an ill-fated young man and young girl who in their peachy beauty had spurned an envious deity who had turned them into a peach tree, and only now, after three thousand years, were being given what had been so unjustly taken away from them, as they murmured, I'll die when you're done, and you mustn't be done, must never be done? The story so aroused me that practically without warning the orgasm was almost upon me. I sensed I could just stop then and there or, with one more stroke, I could come, which I finally did, carefully, aiming the spurt into the reddened core of the open peach as if in a ritual of insemination.</div>

And for last night as well, because, for better or worse, I'd never be able to undo it, and now was as good a time as any to show him that he was right, that this wasn't easy, that fun and games had a way of skidding off course and that if we had rushed into things it was too late to step back from them now -- crying because something was happening, and I had no idea what it was.</div>

He was sitting on one of the higher rocks, wearing his sailor's white-and-blue-striped sweater with the buttons always undone along his shoulder which he'd purchased in Sicily earlier in the summer. He was doing nothing, just hugging his knees, listening to the ripples lap against the rocks below him. Looking at him now from the balustrade, I felt something so tender for him that it reminded me how eagerly I had rushed to B. to catch him before he'd even made it into the post office.

I wanted to protect him from everything this morning, from the rocks, from the jellyfish, now that jellyfish season was upon us, from Anchise, whose sinister leer, as he'd trundle into the garden to turn on the sprinklers, constantly pulling out weeds wherever he turned, even when it rained, even when he spoke to you, even when he threatened to leave us, seemed to tease out every secret you thought you'd neatly buried from his gaze.</div>

<div class="line_en">Marzia called that morning while he was about to leave. He almost winked when he handed me the telephone. There was no hint of irony, nothing that didn't remind me, unless I was mistaken -- and I don't think I was -- that what we had between us was the total transparency that exists among friends only.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早上，就在他要离开时，玛琪雅打电话来。他把话筒交给我，似乎眨了眨眼，其中没有一丝讽刺。除非我会错意（我想我没有），否则一切都在提醒我，我们之间是朋友才有的完全透明的关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When did you know about me?" I asked him one day. I was hoping he'd say, When 1 squeezed your shoulder and you almost wilted in my arms. Or, When you got wet under your bathing suit that one afternoon when we chatted in your room. Something along those lines. "When you blushed," he said. "Me?" We had been talking about translating poetry; it was early in the morning, during his very first week with us. We had started working earlier than usual that day, probably because we already enjoyed our spontaneous conversations while the breakfast table was being laid out under the linden tree and were eager to spend some time together. He'd asked me if I'd ever translated poetry. I said I had. Why, had he? Yes. He was reading Leopardi and had landed on a few verses that were impossible to translate. We had been speaking back and forth, neither of us realizing how far a conversation started on the fly could go, because all the while delving deeper into Leopardi's world, we were also finding occasional side alleys where our natural sense of humor and our love for clowning were given free play. We translated the passage into English, then from English to ancient Greek, then back to gobbledygenglish to gobbledygitalian. Leopardi's closing lines of "To the Moon" were so warped that it brought bursts of laughter as we kept repeating the nonsense lines in Italian -- when suddenly there was a moment of silence, and when I looked up at him he was staring at me point-blank, that icy, glassy look of his which always disconcerted me. I was struggling to say something, and when he asked how I knew so many things, I had the presence of mind to say something about being a professor's son. I was not always eager to show off my knowledge, especially with someone who could so easily intimidate me. I had nothing to fight back with, nothing to add, nothing to throw in to muddy the waters between us, nowhere to hide or run for cover. I felt as exposed as a stranded lamb on the dry, waterless plains of the Serengeti.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你几时察觉的？”有一天我问他。原本我希望他说“我捏你肩膀，你几乎在我臂弯里枯萎的时候”，或“我们在你房间聊天，你弄湿泳裤的那个下午”之类的。“你脸红的时候。”他说。“我？”当时我们在讨论译诗，那是他到我们这儿来第一周某日的一大早。那天我们比平常更早开始工作，或许因为早餐桌在极树下排开来时，我们已经享受过一段自在的交谈，因此很渴望花点时间相处。他间我是否译过诗。我说译过。怎么着，他译过吗？译过。他正在读莱奥帕尔迪，遇到几个无法翻译的诗句。我们往复讨论，彼此都不知道一段贸然展开的对话能够进行到什么地步，因为在更深入探索莱奥帕尔迪世界的同时，我们也发现偶然的小岔路，让我们天生的幽默感与爱开玩笑有机会尽情发挥。我们把那段话译为英文，接着从英文译成古希腊文，然后译回佶屈聱牙的英文，再译成佶屈聱牙的意大利文。因为莱奥帕尔迪的《致月亮》最后一句被过度转译，我们在不断以意大利文重复无意义的诗句时爆笑出声——这时突然出现一阵静默，我抬头看他，他正率直地用他那总是令我仓皇失措、冰冷无神的目光盯着我看。我挣扎着想说点什么，接着他问我怎么这么博学，我镇定地说了类似“因为我是教授之子”的话。我并不总是那么急切地想炫耀我的知识，尤其面对一个让我畏怯的人。我没有什么能反击、补充的，没有什么能搅乱彼此关系的能耐，没有地方躲藏或寻求掩护。我仿若一只羔羊，困在千燥无水的塞伦盖蒂平原上，无处躲藏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The staring was no longer part of the conversation, or even of the fooling around with translation; it had superseded it and become its own subject, except that neither dared nor wanted to bring it up. And yes, there was such a luster in his eyes that I had to look away, and when I looked back at him, his gaze hadn't moved and was still focused on my face, as if to say, So you looked away and you've come back, will you be looking away again soon?-- which was why I had to look away once more, as if immersed in thought, yet all the while scrambling for something to say, the way a fish struggles for water in a muddied pond that's fast drying up in the heat. He must have known exactly what I was feeling. What made me blush in the end was not the natural embarrassment of the moment when I could tell he'd caught me trying to hold his gaze only then to let mine scamper to safety; what made me blush was the thrilling possibility, unbelievable as I wanted it to remain, that he might actually like me, and that he liked me in just the way I liked him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our best moments were in the afternoon. After lunch, I'd go upstairs for a nap just when coffee was about to be served. Then, when the lunch guests had left, or slunk away to rest in the guesthouse, my father would either retire to his study or steal a nap with my mother. By two in the afternoon, an intense silence would settle over the house, over the world it seemed, interrupted here and there either by the cooing of doves or by Anchise's hammer when he worked on his tools and was trying not to make too much noise. I liked hearing him at work in the afternoon, and even when his occasional banging or sawing woke me up, or when the knife grinder would start his whetstone running every Wednesday afternoon, it left me feeling as restful and at peace with the world as I would feel years later on hearing a distant foghorn off Cape Cod in the middle of the night. Oliver liked to keep the windows and shutters wide open in the afternoon, with just the swelling sheer curtains between us and life beyond, because it was a "crime" to block away so much sunlight and keep such a landscape from view, especially when you didn't have it all life long, he said. Then the rolling fields of the valley leading up to the hills seemed to sit in a rising mist of olive green: sunflowers, grapevines, swatches of lavender, and those squat and humble olive trees stooping like gnarled, aged scarecrows gawking through our window as we lay naked on my bed, the smell of his sweat, which was the smell of my sweat, and next to me my man-woman whose man-woman I was, and all around us Mafalda's chamomile-scented laundry detergent, which was the scent of the torrid afternoon world of our house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们最美好的时刻在午后。午餐后，就在上咖啡前，我会上楼小睡一下。午餐宾客离开或悄悄到客房休息时，父亲可能躲进书房，或溜去跟母亲午睡。到了下午两点，极度的寂静在这栋房屋落脚，仿佛笼罩这个世界。零零落落地，偶尔听到鸽子的咕咕声，或是响起安喀斯边打点工具、边尽量避免发出大噪音的铁锤声。我喜欢听他下午工作的声音，即使偶尔被他的砰砰声、锯物声，或每周三下午砂轮机发动磨刀石的声音吵醒，这一切让我觉得恬静而与世无争。就像多年以后，夜半时分，听到远方雾笛声从鳕鱼角⑰附近传来的感受。下午，奥利弗喜欢敞着窗户和百叶窗，让我们和往后的人生之间只隔着飘飞的透明纱帘。他总说若是遮蔽太多阳光，将这样的景致遮挡在视线之外，就是一种“罪行”：你可无法一辈子拥有这样的风景。这时，谷地与丘陵间那片高低起伏的原野似乎笼罩在飘升的橄榄绿色雾霭中：除了向日葵、葡萄藤、一小簇一小簇的薰衣草，还有那些谦卑盘踞的橄榄树，犹如浑身长满疖瘤的老稻草人弯着腰，在我们裸身躺在我床上时，透过窗户痴望进来。他的汗水味，也是我的汗水味，我的身边是我的爱人同志⑱，而我也是他的爱人同志。包围着我们的，是玛法尔达那带着黄春菊气味的洗衣剂，那也是我们家这个世界在灼热午后散发的气味。【注：⑰鳕鱼角（Cape Cod）：美国麻州（Massachusetts）东南方的一个钩状半岛。⑱原文为man – woman。】">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew that our minutes were numbered, but I didn't dare count them, just as I knew where all this was headed, but didn't care to read the signposts. This was a time when I intentionally failed to drop bread crumbs for my return journey; instead, I ate them.

<div class="line_en">A few hours later, the clouds totally cleared, and the weather, as though to make up for its little prank, seemed to erase every hint of fall from our lives and gave us one of the most temperate days of the season. But I had heeded the warning, and as is said of juries who have heard inadmissible evidence before it is stricken from the record, I suddenly realized that we were on borrowed time, that time is always borrowed, and that the lending agency exacts its premium precisely when we are least prepared to pay and need to borrow more. Suddenly, I began to take mental snapshots of him, picked up the bread crumbs that fell off our table and collected them for my hideaway, and, to my shame, drew lists: the rock, the berm, the bed, the sound of the ashtray. The rock, the berm, the bed… I wished I were like those soldiers in films who run out of bullets and toss away their guns as though they would never again have any use for them, or like runaways in the desert who, rather than ration the water in the gourd, yield to thirst and swill away, then drop their gourd in their tracks. Instead, I squirreled away small things so that in the lean days ahead glimmers from the past might bring back the warmth. I began, reluctantly, to steal from the present to pay off debts I knew I'd incur in the future. This, I knew, was as much a crime as closing the shutters on sunny afternoons. But I also knew that in Mafalda's superstitious world, anticipating the worst was as sure a way of preventing it from happening.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the train I told him about the day we thought he'd drowned and how I was determined to ask my father to round up as many fishermen as he could to go look for him, and when they found him, to light a pyre on our shore, while I grabbed Mafalda's knife from the kitchen and ripped out his heart, because that heart and his shirt were all I'd ever have to show for my life. A heart and a shirt. His heart wrapped in a damp shirt -- like Anchise's fish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在火车上，我告诉他，有一天我们还以为他溺水了，那天我是如何决心央求父亲尽可能召集渔夫去找他。等渔夫找到他，在我们的海滩上点燃一堆柴，我要从厨房拿来玛法尔达的刀子，割下他的心脏，因为那颗心脏和他的衬衫是我这一生仅有的成绩。一颗心和一件衬衫。他包裹在湿衬衫里的心脏——像安喀斯的鱼。">查看中文翻译</div>
