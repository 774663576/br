<div class="line_en">Now we must go back to Mr and Mrs Beaver and the three other children. As soon as Mr Beaver said, "There's no time to lose," everyone began bundling themselves into coats, except Mrs Beaver, who started picking up sacks and laying them on the table and said: "Now, Mr Beaver, just reach down that ham. And here's a packet of tea, and there's sugar, and some matches. And if someone will get two or three loaves out of the crock over there in the corner."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, please, please, please, do hurry!" said the three children. And so at last they all got outside and Mr Beaver locked the door ("It'll delay her a bit," he said) and they set off, all carrying their loads over their shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，请快点吧！请快点吧！”三个孩子说。就这样他们才终于出了门，海狸先生锁上门。（“这会耽误她一点时间。”它说。）他们就此出发了，大家都把自己的一份行李扛在肩上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The snow had stopped and the moon had come out when they began their journey. They went in single file -- first Mr Beaver, then Lucy, then Peter, then Susan, and Mrs Beaver last of all. Mr Beaver led them across the dam and on to the right bank of the river and then along a very rough sort of path among the trees right down by the river-bank. The sides of the valley, shining in the moonlight, towered up far above them on either hand. "Best keep down here as much as possible," he said. "She'll have to keep to the top, for you couldn't bring a sledge down here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们上路时雪已经停了，月亮也出来了。他们排成单行走着——海狸先生走在头里，随后是露茜，再后是彼得、苏珊，海狸太太走在末尾。海狸先生带他们穿过堤坝，走到河的右岸，然后走到河岸下面树丛里一条崎岖不平的小路上。月光照耀下，山谷两边的峭坡高耸入云。“最好尽可能在下面走，”海狸先生说，“她只能从上面走，因为不能把雪橇赶到下面来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would have been a pretty enough scene to look at it through a window from a comfortable armchair; and even as things were, Lucy enjoyed it at first. But as they went on walking and walking -- and walking and as the sack she was carrying felt heavier and heavier, she began to wonder how she was going to keep up at all. And she stopped looking at the dazzling brightness of the frozen river with all its waterfalls of ice and at the white masses of the tree-tops and the great glaring moon and the countless stars and could only watch the little short legs of Mr Beaver going pad-pad-pad-pad through the snow in front of her as if they were never going to stop. Then the moon disappeared and the snow began to fall once more. And at last Lucy was so tired that she was almost asleep and walking at the same time when suddenly she found that Mr Beaver had turned away from the river-bank to the right and was leading them steeply uphill into the very thickest bushes. And then as she came fully awake she found that Mr Beaver was just vanishing into a little hole in the bank which had been almost hidden under the bushes until you were quite on top of it. In fact, by the time she realized what was happening, only his short flat tail was showing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果是坐在安逸的扶手椅里，往窗外眺望，看到的也许算得上是一幅美景；尽管事情到了这个地步，露茜开头对这儿还是很欣赏的。不过随着他们走啊走的，她背上的口袋也越来越重了，她开始怀疑自己怎么坚持得下去。河面以及水帘子都结了冰，她不再去看那条亮得耀眼的冰河，也不去看树顶上大团大团的雪，以及那光芒四射的大月亮和数不清的星星，只看着前面海狸先生那短小的腿在雪地里啪哒啪哒地走，仿佛永远也停不下来似的。接着月亮不见了，雪又开始下了。最后露茜累得几乎是边走边睡了。突然，她发现海狸先生离开河岸往右走，领着他们奋力爬上陡峭的山坡，走进密集的灌木丛中。等到她完全清醒过来，她发现海狸先生钻进山坡上的一个小洞里，那个洞几乎完全被灌木丛遮住，一直走到洞口才看得见。事实上等她明白是怎么回事，已经只看得见它那扁扁的短尾巴了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy immediately stooped down and crawled in after him. Then she heard noises of scrambling and puffing and panting behind her and in a moment all five of them were inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜赶紧弯下腰跟着它爬了进去。接着她听到身后急急忙忙爬行的声音和喘气声，不一会儿，他们五个都进了洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wherever is this?" said Peter's voice, sounding tired and pale in the darkness. (I hope you know what I mean by a voice sounding pale.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这到底是哪儿呀？”彼得说，黑暗中他的声音听上去又疲倦又乏力。（我希望你们知道我说的声音乏力是什么意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you hadn't all been in such a plaguey fuss when we were starting, I'd have brought some pillows," said Mrs Beaver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要不是你们动身时都那么手忙脚乱，我本来可以带几个枕头来的。”海狸太太说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's an old hiding-place for beavers in bad times," said Mr Beaver, "and a great secret. It's not much of a place but we must get a few hours' sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是海狸遇难时一个老的藏身处，”海狸先生说，“是一大秘密。地方虽不怎么样，不过我们一定得睡上几小时。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't nearly such a nice cave as Mr Tumnus's, Lucy thought -- just a hole in the ground but dry and earthy. It was very small so that when they all lay down they were all a bundle of clothes together, and what with that and being warmed up by their long walk they were really rather snug. If only the floor of the cave had been a little smoother! Then Mrs Beaver handed round in the dark a little flask out of which everyone drank something -- it made one cough and splutter a little and stung the throat, but it also made you feel deliciously warm after you'd swallowed it and everyone went straight to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿跟图姆纳斯先生的石窟可相差太远了，露茜想着——只是一个洞，不过洞里还算干燥，而且是泥土地。洞非常小，因此当他们全都躺下时，就成了一大堆皮毛和衣服。这样躺着，再加上他们长途跋涉身上也暖和了，他们果真觉得相当舒服。要是这洞里的地稍微平整一点就更好了。随后海狸太太在黑暗中传过来一个小小的长颈瓶子，每个人都就着瓶子喝了一口——喝了这东西叫人直呛．嗓子眼火辣辣的，不过咽下肚去以后倒使人感到暖和得舒心——大家立刻就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to Lucy only the next minute (though really it was hours and hours later) when she woke up feeling a little cold and dreadfully stiff and thinking how she would like a hot bath. Then she felt a set of long whiskers tickling her cheek and saw the cold daylight coming in through the mouth of the cave. But immediately after that she was very wide awake indeed, and so was everyone else. In fact they were all sitting up with their mouths and eyes wide open listening to a sound which was the very sound they'd all been thinking of (and sometimes imagining they heard) during their walk last night. It was a sound of jingling bells.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜觉得似乎只过了片刻（虽然实际上已是好几小时以后了），她一觉醒来感到身子有点冷，而且僵硬得可怕，心想能洗个热水澡该有多好。随后她就觉得有一束长胡子撩在脸蛋上怪痒痒的，又看到洞口有冰凉的阳光照进来。这一来她当然立刻完全清醒了，而且大家也都醒了。事实上他们全都坐了起来，眼睛嘴巴都张得大大的，倾听着他们昨晚走路时一直想着的声音（有时他们还想象着听到了呢）。那就是铃铛的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Beaver was out of the cave like a flash the moment he heard it. Perhaps you think, as Lucy thought for a moment, that this was a very silly thing to do? But it was really a very sensible one. He knew he could scramble to the top of the bank among bushes and brambles without being seen; and he wanted above all things to see which way the Witch's sledge went. The others all sat in the cave waiting and wondering. They waited nearly five minutes. Then they heard something that frightened them very much. They heard voices. "Oh," thought Lucy, "he's been seen. She's caught him!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海狸先生一听见声音顿时就钻出洞去。也许你会像露茜当时所想的那样，觉得它这么做是犯傻了。其实这么做倒是很聪明的。它知道自己能躲在山坡顶上的灌木丛中不让人看见；最主要的是它想看看妖婆的雪橇往哪条路走。其他几个都坐在山洞里等着，满腹疑虑。他们大概等了五分钟。接着听见了什么动静，吓得他们要命。他们听见了说话声；“哦，”露茜想，“它被发现了。她逮住它了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's all right," he was shouting. "Come out, Mrs Beaver. Come out, Sons and Daughters of Adam. It's all right! It isn't Her!" This was bad grammar of course, but that is how beavers talk when they are excited; I mean, in Narnia -- in our world they usually don't talk at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没事儿，”它大声叫道，“出来吧，海狸太太。出来吧，亚当和夏娃的儿女们。没事儿，原来它不是她！”这句话当然有点不通，不过海狸激动起来就是那么说话的；我是说在纳尼亚——在我们的世界里海狸通常是根本不说话的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Great was their surprise when a little later, they heard Mr Beaver's voice calling to them from just outside the cave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone knew him because, though you see people of his sort only in Narnia, you see pictures of them and hear them talked about even in our world -- the world on this side of the wardrobe door. But when you really see them in Narnia it is rather different. Some of the pictures of Father Christmas in our world make him look only funny and jolly. But now that the children actually stood looking at him they didn't find it quite like that. He was so big, and so glad, and so real, that they all became quite still. They felt very glad, but also solemn.</div>

The hilt of the sword was of gold and it had a sheath and a sword belt and everything it needed, and it was just the right size and weight for Peter to use.

<div class="line_cn" title="最后他才说，“露茜，夏娃的女儿。”露茜走上前去。他给她一只小瓶子，看上去好像是玻璃的（不过事后人们说那瓶子是钻石做的）和一把小匕首。“在这个瓶子里，”他说，“有一种妙药，是用长在太阳之山上的一种火花的汁提炼的。如果你或是你哪个朋友受了伤，洒上几滴就能治好。这把匕首是给你在紧急时自卫的。因为你也用不着打仗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is not the point," he said. "But battles are ugly when women fight. And now" -- here he suddenly looked less grave -- "here is something for the moment for you all!" and he brought out (I suppose from the big bag at his back, but nobody quite saw him do it) a large tray containing five cups and saucers, a bowl of lump sugar, a jug of cream, and a great big teapot all sizzling and piping hot. Then he cried out "Merry Christmas! Long live the true King!" and cracked his whip, and he and the reindeer and the sledge and all were out of sight before anyone realized that they had started.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是那个意思，”他说，“让女人打仗是丑陋的。现在呢，”——说到这儿他突然看上去不那么严肃了——“还有一些东西是眼下给你们大家的！”他拿出（我猜是从他背上那只大口袋里拿出来的，不过没人看见他怎么拿的）一只大托盘，上面有五套杯碟，一钵方糖，一罐奶油，一只嘶嘶直响的滚烫大茶壶。接着他叫道：“圣诞快乐！真命国王万岁！”说着一扬鞭子，他们还没看清他已经动身了，他就驾着驯鹿拉的雪橇走得没影了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, sir?" said Lucy. "I think -- I don't know but I think I could be brave enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么，先生，”露茜说，“我想——我不知道——不过我想，我会够勇敢的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Susan, Eve's Daughter," said Father Christmas. "These are for you," and he handed her a bow and a quiver full of arrows and a little ivory horn. "You must use the bow only in great need," he said, "for I do not mean you to fight in the battle. It does not easily miss. And when you put this horn to your lips; and blow it, then, wherever you are, I think help of some kind will come to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“苏珊，夏娃的女儿，”圣诞老人说，“这些是给你的。”他递给她一张弓、一只装满箭的箭袋和一只小小的象牙号角。“你必须在紧急时才能使用这弓箭，”他说，“因为我无意让你去打仗。这弓箭百发百中。一旦你拿起这只号角，吹响了，不管你在哪儿，我想你都会得到帮助。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter had just drawn his sword out of its sheath and was showing it to Mr Beaver, when Mrs Beaver said: "Now then, now then! Don't stand talking there till the tea's got cold. Just like men. Come and help to carry the tray down and we'll have breakfast. What a mercy I thought of bringing the bread-knife."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得刚从剑鞘里抽出剑给海狸先生看，海狸太太就说：“好了，好了，别站在那儿说话，说得茶凉了。像个男人的样子。来帮帮忙把托盘搬下去，我们就要吃早餐了。幸亏我想到把面包刀带来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So down the steep bank they went and back to the cave, and Mr Beaver cut some of the bread and ham into sandwiches and Mrs Beaver poured out the tea and everyone enjoyed themselves. But long before they had finished enjoying themselves Mr Beaver said, "Time to be moving on now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们走下陡峭的山坡，回到洞里，海狸先生切了点面包和火腿，做成夹肉面包，海狸太太斟茶，大家吃得津津有味。不过没等他们好好享用多久，海狸先生就说，“现在是行动的时候了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
