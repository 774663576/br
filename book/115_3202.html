<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克没答话。他把车开得飞快。我认识此人到现在还是第一次看到他找不着一句现成的客套话说。这说明他在担心，非常担心。在平时，他把车开得很慢，相当小心，每到十字路口非把车煞住，左右看一眼才行；而每次转弯之前，则必然揿喇叭为号。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Again Frank did not answer. I realized that his loyalty to Maxim was such that he would not let himself be drawn into a discussion, even with me. He did not know how much I knew. Nor could I tell for certainty how much he knew. We were allies, we travelled the same road, but we could not look at one another. We neither of us dared risk a confession. We were turning in now at the lodge gates, and down the long twisting narrow drive to the house. I noticed for the first time how the hydrangeas were coming into bloom, their blue heads thrusting themselves from the green foliage behind. For all their beauty there was something sombre about them, funereal; they were like the wreaths, stiff and artificial, that you see beneath glass cases in a foreign churchyard. There they were, all the way along the drive, on either side of us, blue, monotonous, like spectators lined up in a street to watch us pass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克还是没答话。我明白他对迈克西姆一腔忠心，决不让自己被扯着会议论他的事，即使跟我一起议论，他也不干。他不知道我对事情的底细了解到何种程度，而我也说不准他知道多少情况。我和他两人是盟友，走在一条路上，但却不能互看一眼，谁也不敢冒险把实情说出来。这时，车正驶进庄园大门，接着驶上漫长、曲折的狭窄车道，往宅子驰去。我第一次注意到绣球花正在开放，蓝色的花球从背后的绿叶丛中探出头来。尽管花姿秀美，可是总有点阴森森的，悲哀而肃穆；绣球花就像外国教堂墓地上放在玻璃棺材底下的花圈，显得刻板，带着人工雕琢的痕迹。车道两边一路上全是绣球花，就像青面獠牙的巨大鬼怪在街上列队看我们通过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他没再说什么，匆匆赶回汽车，开着车走了。迈克西姆可能需要他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why did he say Maxim might want him? Perhaps the Coroner was going to question Frank as well. Ask him about that evening, over twelve months ago, when Maxim had dined with Frank. He would want to know the exact time that Maxim left his house. He would want to know if anybody saw Maxim when he returned to the house. Whether the servants knew that he was there. Whether anybody could prove that Maxim went straight up to bed and undressed. Mrs Danvers might be questioned. They might ask Mrs Danvers to give evidence. And Maxim beginning to lose his temper, beginning to go white…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他干吗说迈克西姆可能需要他？也许验尸官还要盘问弗兰克，向他打听十二个月之前那个夜晚的情况。那天晚上，迈克西姆不是在弗兰克家吃的饭吗？验尸官肯定要问迈克西姆离开他家的确切时间。他还会查问，迈克西姆回家时可曾有人见到过他，仆人是不是知道他已回家，有谁能够证明迈克西姆回家后直接上床脱衣就寝。可能会问到丹弗斯太太，要她提供证词。而迈克西姆则开始大发脾气，脸色煞白…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not know what happened. I did not know what people did. I remembered pictures of men in the papers, leaving places like that, and being taken away. Suppose Maxim was taken away? They would not let me go to him. They would not let me see him. I should have to stay here at Manderley day after day, night after night, waiting, as I was waiting now. People like Colonel Julyan being kind. People saying "You must not be alone. You must come to us." The telephone, the newspapers, the telephone again. "No, Mrs de Winter can't see anyone. Mrs de Winter has no story to give the County Chronicle." And another day. And another day. Weeks that would be blurred and non-existent. Frank at last taking me to see Maxim. He would look thin, queer, like people in hospital…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不懂在这种场合人们会采取何种措施。我记得在报上见过一些照片，照片上的人被押着走出类似传讯大厅的场所。要是迈克西姆也被他们押走呢？他们会不许我走近他，不让我去看他。那我就得像此刻一样，日复一日，夜复一夜，等着，等着。朱利安上校和别的朋友都会跑来表示慰问，说什么“您可不能独居深宅，到我们这儿来吧”。电话，报纸，又是电话。“不，德温特夫人不能见人。德温特夫人对《本郡纪事报》无可奉告。”过了一天。又过了一天。一个又一个星期就这么逝去，在记忆中留下模糊的印象，甚至根本没有印象。最后还是弗兰克带我去看迈克西姆。他瘦了，模样很古怪，就像医院里的病人…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我负责本案可不是因为闲得发慌，没事找事开玩笑。”这人的头脑虽不算敏捷，可细致周密，而且动辄上火。这会儿那些人都在说些什么？又发生了什么事？要是过一会儿弗兰克口到曼陀丽来，独自一个人回来，怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other women had been through this. Women I had read about in papers. They sent letters to the Home Secretary and it was not any good. The Home Secretary always said that justice must take its course. Friends sent petitions too, everybody signed them, but the Home Secretary could never do anything. And the ordinary people who read about it in the papers said why should the fellow get off, he murdered his wife, didn't he? What about the poor, murdered wife? This sentimental business about abolishing the death penalty simply encourages crime. This fellow ought to have thought about that before he killed his wife. It's too late now. He will have to hang for it, like any other murderer. And serve him right too. Let it be a warning to others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="别的女人曾有过这样的经历，我在报上读到过这类女人的事。她们上书内务大臣，一点没用。内务大臣总是说什么要执法如山。朋友们也递上呼吁书，大家都签了名，可是内务大臣爱莫能助。而在报上读到案情的普通人却在一旁说风凉话：干吗要把这家伙放了？毕竟是杀妻的凶手，对不对？放了他，那被谋杀的可怜的妻子怎么说？废除死刑乃是一味讲究仁慈宽大的人在那儿胡来，只会纵容罪犯。这家伙在动手杀死妻子以前应该考虑到后果。现在可晚了。他得像别的杀人犯一样，为此偿命，并以此儆戒后人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember seeing a picture on the back of a paper once, of a little crowd collected outside a prison gate, and just after nine o'clock a policeman came and pinned a notice on the gate for the people to read. The notice said something about the sentence being carried out. "Sentence of death was carried out this morning at nine o'clock. The Governor, the Prison Doctor, and the Sheriff of the County were present." Hanging was quick. Hanging did not hurt. It broke your neck at once. No, it did not. Someone said once it did not always work. Someone who had known the Governor of a prison. They put that bag over your head, and you stand on the little platform, and then the floor gives way beneath you. It takes exactly three minutes to go from the cell to the moment you are hanged. No, fifty seconds, someone said. No, that's absurd. It could not be fifty seconds. There's a little flight of steps down the side of the shed, down to the pit. The doctor goes down there to look. They die instantly. No, they don't. The body moves for some time, the neck is not always broken. Yes, but even so they don't feel anything. Someone said they did. Someone who had a brother who was a prison doctor said it was not generally known, because it would be such a scandal, but they did not always die at once. Their eyes were open, they stay open for quite a long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得有一次曾在报纸背面看到一张照片。照片上是聚集在监狱门外的一小群人。九点刚过，一名警察走来，在门上贴出一张告示，晓喻众人。告示宣布已经行刑：“死刑已于今晨九时执行。典狱长、狱医和本郡行政官行刑时在场。”绞刑只消一会儿工夫，而且不让人感到什么痛苦，一下子勒断你的脖子。不，不是这样。听人说，有时也绞不死人。那是曾跟某一位典狱长相熟的人说出来的。他们用一只袋子套住你的头，你站上小小的刑台，接着猛一个脚不着地…从走出地牢到被绞死，不多不少需要三分钟时间。不，五十秒就够了，有人说过的。不，这说法荒诞不经，五十秒不可能。从那棚子边到下面坑里还得走一小段阶梯呢。狱医总要下坑查验。那些犯人都是转眼就死的。不，不是转眼就死，躯体还会蠕动好一阵子，因为脖子并不总是一下子就被勒断。不过，即使这样，受刑的人也不会感觉到什么。可是也有人说，受刑的人照样有感觉。那人有个兄弟当狱医。据那人说，犯人并不都即刻死去，只是因为怕事情传出引得舆论哗然，才不让外界知道罢了。犯人的眼睛瞪得滚圆，好长一段时间就这么回瞪着。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was something so quiet and hopeless about their sympathy. Jasper, knowing something was wrong, as dogs always do. Trunks being packed. Cars being brought to the door. Dogs standing with drooping tails, dejected eyes. Wandering back to their baskets in the hall when the sound of the car dies away…</div>

<div class="line_en">God, don't let me go on thinking about this. Let me think about something else. About other things. About Mrs Van Hopper in America. She must be staying with her daughter now. They had that house on Long Island in the summer. I expect they played a lot of bridge. They went to the races. Mrs Van Hopper was fond of the races. I wonder if she still wears that little yellow hat. It was too small for her. Much too small on that big face. Mrs Van Hopper sitting about in the garden of that house on Long Island, with novels, and magazines, and papers on her lap. Mrs Van Hopper putting up her lorgnette and calling to her daughter. "Look at this, Helen. They say Max de Winter murdered his first wife. I always did think there was something peculiar about him. I warned that fool of a girl she was making a mistake, but she wouldn't listen to me. Well, she's cooked her goose now all right. I suppose they'll make her a big offer to go on the pictures."</div>

Where exactly was the first hole in relation to the second? What was ballast? What effect upon the stability of the boat would the shifting of the ballast have? Could a woman do this unaided? Did the cabin door shut firmly? What pressure of water was necessary to burst open the door? I thought I should go mad. I kept my temper though. Seeing you there, by the door, made me remember what I had to do. If you had not fainted like that, I should never have done it. It brought me up with a jerk. I knew exactly what I was going to say. I faced Horridge all the time. I never took my eyes off his thin, pernickety, little face and those gold-rimmed pince-nez. I shall remember that face of his to my dying day.

<div class="line_en">He sat down on the window-seat. He leant forward, his head in his hands. I went and sat beside him. In a few minutes Frith came in, followed by Robert carrying the table for tea. The solemn ritual went forward as it always did, day after day, the leaves of the table pulled out, the legs adjusted, the laying of the snowy cloth, the putting down of the silver teapot and the kettle with the little flame beneath. Scones, sandwiches, three different sorts of cake. Jasper sat close to the table, his tail thumping now and again upon the floor, his eyes fixed expectantly on me. It's funny, I thought, how the routine of life goes on, whatever happens, we do the same things, go through the little performance of eating, sleeping, washing. No crisis can break through the crust of habit. I poured out Maxim's tea, I took it to him on the window-seat, gave him his scone, and buttered one for myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed very quiet in the library when he had gone. I began to think of them down at the church, going through that door and down the flight of stairs to the crypt. I had never been there. I had only seen the door. I wondered what a crypt was like, if there were coffins standing there. Maxim's father and mother. I wondered what would happen to the coffin of that other woman who had been put there by mistake. I wondered who she was, poor unclaimed soul, washed up by the wind and tide. Now another coffin would stand there. Rebecca would lie there in the crypt as well. Was the vicar reading the burial service there, with Maxim, and Frank, and Colonel Julyan standing by his side? Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. It seemed to me that Rebecca had no reality any more. She had crumbled away when they had found her on the cabin floor. It was not Rebecca who was lying in the crypt, it was dust. Only dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仆人走后，藏书室里静极了。我开始想象他们在教堂举行仪式的情景，想象这些人如何穿过旁门，走下一段石级，来到墓地。我从未到过墓地，只见过那扇旁门。不知道墓地是什么模样，是不是棺材成排？迈克西姆的父母在墓地长眠。不知道他们会怎么处理那个李代桃僵的无名女子的棺材。这无名女子会是谁呢？可怜的人，曝尸海滩，任风浪冲刷，又没人认领。如今，墓地上将增加一具棺材，吕蓓卡也将躺在那儿长眠。这会儿，牧师大概正念念有词地为死者举行落葬祈祷，迈克西姆和弗兰克，还有朱利安上校，也许都站在他身旁。人本尘灰，死后复成尘灰。我觉得这下子吕蓓卡再也不是一个血肉俱备的真人；当她的尸骸在船舱被人发现，吕蓓卡就化作了灰尘。所以说在墓地那具棺材里盛放的并不是吕蓓卡其人，而是全灰。尘灰一撮，如此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

I can speak plainly then, and I will. You all know about Rebecca and me. We were lovers, weren't we? I've never denied it, and I never will. Very well then. Up to the present I believed, like every other fool, that Rebecca was drowned sailing in the bay, and that her body was picked up at Edgecoombe weeks afterwards. It was a shock to me then, a bloody shock. But I said to myself, That's the sort of death Rebecca would choose, she'd go out like she lived, fighting." He paused, he sat there on the edge of the sofa, looking at all of us in turn. "Then I pick up the evening paper a few days ago and I read that Rebecca's boat had been stumbled on by the local diver and that there was a body in the cabin. I couldn't understand it. Who the hell would Rebecca have as a sailing companion? It didn't make sense. I came down here, and put up at a pub just outside Kerrith. I got in touch with Mrs Danvers. She told me then that the body in the cabin was Rebecca's. Even so I thought like everyone else that the first body was a mistake and Rebecca had somehow got shut in the cabin when she went to fetch a coat. Well, I attended that inquest today, as you know. And everything went smoothly, didn't it, until Tabb gave his evidence? But after that? Well, Max, old man, what have you got to say about those holes in the floorboards, and those seacocks turned full on?"</div>

I felt helpless, without strength. There was nothing I could do. Nothing that Frank could do. In a book or in a play I would have found a revolver, and we should have shot Favell, hidden his body in a cupboard. There was no revolver. There was no cupboard. We were ordinary people. These things did not happen. I could not go to Maxim now and beg him on my knees to give Favell the money.

<div class="line_en">Maxim did not say anything. Favell twisted the piece of paper in his fingers, considering Colonel Julyan all the while. "My cousin made a definite appointment in that note, didn't she?" he said. "She deliberately asked me to drive down to Manderley that night because she had something to tell me. What it actually was I don't suppose we shall ever know, but that's beside the point. She made the appointment, and she was to spend the night in the cottage on purpose to see me alone. The mere fact of her going for a sail never surprised me. It was the sort of thing she did, for an hour or so, after a long day in London. But to plug holes in the cabin and deliberately drown herself, the hysterical impulsive freak of a neurotic girl -- oh, no, Colonel Julyan, by Christ no!" The colour had flooded into his face, and the last words were shouted. His manner was not helpful to him, and I could see by the thin line of Colonel Julyan's mouth that he had not taken to Favell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆没有回答。费弗尔用手指搓着那纸条，一面不住地打量朱利安上校的脸色。“我表妹在这封信里安排了一个时间、地点都非常确定的约会，是不是？”费弗尔说。“她特地吩咐，让我当夜开车来曼陀丽，因为她有事相告。究竟是什么事，我看谁也没法知道真相了。可这与本题无关。要紧的是她安排了约会，而为了见我特地在海滩小屋过夜。至于她开船出去这个事实本身，我也不觉得奇怪。她常常这样，在伦敦忙了一天之后，松散个把小时。可是在船上砸洞，有意寻死溺毙，这可是那种神经质的女人一时冲动的蠢举。哦，不，朱利安上校，老天爷有眼，她才不这么干呢！”血涌上这家伙的脸，说到最后他已大声叫喊起来。这种腔调对他其实并无好处，我看见朱利安上校嘴角隐隐撅起，这说明他对费弗尔印象不佳。">查看中文翻译</div>
