<div class="line_en">"Congratulations," Cross said, giving her a brotherly hug. "I always said you were the toughest of the Clericuzio."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恭喜，”克罗斯说，并给了她一个兄长式的拥抱，“我早就说，你才是克莱里库齐奥家族最厉害的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, listen, this is weird," Claudia said. "Remember that girl Johanna that Bantz had with him at the wrap party? Do you remember what she looked like? Well, it turns out she was only fifteen years old. They got Bobby on statutory rape and white slavery because he took her across the state border." Claudia's eyes were wide with excitement. "But it was all a setup. Johanna's mother and father were there screaming bloody murder that their poor daughter had been raped by a man forty years older."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“才不是，听着，这件事很古怪，”克劳迪娅说，“还记得邦茨带去庆功宴的女孩儿约翰娜吗？你还记得她长什么样吗？她竟然才十五岁。邦茨的罪名是强奸幼女，还有卖女性为娼，因为他带着她跨过州境了。”克劳迪娅激动得瞪大双眼，“但这肯定是陷害，约翰娜的父母嚷着他们可怜的女儿被一个大她四十岁的男人强奸了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Claudia shrugged. "I don't care about them. But let me tell you what happened because it is so strange. When we all left Vegas in Bobby's jet, everything seemed perfect. But when we landed in L. A., all hell broke loose. Detectives arrested Bobby. For guess what?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克劳迪娅耸肩道：“我才不在乎他们呢。不过，有件事情可奇怪啦，我给你讲。我们乘邦茨的飞机离开拉斯维加斯的时候，一切都很完美。但等我们降落在洛杉矶的时候，就出怪事了。探员逮捕了邦茨，你猜罪名是什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It would have made a terrible scandal," Claudia said. "But good old Skippy Deere took charge. He got Bantz off the hook for that moment. He kept him from being arrested and the whole thing getting into the media. So everything seems squared away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这本来会变成一桩特大丑闻的，”克劳迪娅说，“但老练的斯基比·迪尔控制住了局势，他暂且保全了邦茨。没让他被捕，也没让这件事进入媒体的视线。所以似乎已经风平浪静了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She sure didn't look fifteen," Cross said. "Though she did look like a good hustler."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她看上去肯定不像十五岁，”克罗斯说，“倒像个老练的骗子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not funny," Claudia said reproachfully. "Poor Bobby was framed. The girl swore that Bobby forced her to have sex in Vegas. The father and mother swore they cared nothing for money but wanted to stop all future rapists of young and innocent girls. The whole Studio was in an uproar. Dora and Kevin Marrion were so upset that they talked about selling the Studio. Then Skippy took charge again. He signed the girl to star in a low-budget film, the script to be written by her father. For very good money. Then he got Benny Sly to rewrite the script in one day for a lot of money. Not bad, by the way, Benny is some kind of genius. We're all set. And then the district attorney of Los Angeles insists he's going to prosecute. The DA that LoddStone got elected, the DA who was treated like a king by Eli Marrion. Skippy even offered him a job at the Studio in Business Affairs at a million a year for five years and he turned it down. He insisted Bobby Bantz be fired as head of the Studio. Then he would make a deal. Nobody knows why he was being so hard-nosed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可不好笑，”克劳迪娅嗔怪道，“可怜的鲍比被陷害了。那女孩儿咬定鲍比在拉斯维加斯逼她发生了关系。而她的父母硬说自己不在乎钱，只想阻止未来还有人强奸无辜少女。公司上下全都闹翻天。朵拉·马林和凯文·马林商量着要把公司卖掉。然后斯基比又挺身而出，把那女孩儿签去主演一个低成本的片子，剧本是她父亲写的。片酬丰厚。然后他又花了另外一大笔钱雇了本尼·斯莱，让他花一天时间把剧本修改了。效果不错，顺便说一句，本尼的确有几分天才。这样就万事俱备了。不过洛杉矶的地方检察官坚持要起诉鲍比，这位检察官是罗德斯通支持获选的，也被伊莱·马林皇帝似的供着。斯基比甚至聘过他在公司的业务部干五年，年薪一百万美元。但他却说除非鲍比·邦茨引咎辞职，否则没门。谁也不知道他为什么一副铁石心肠。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Claudia was still talking, fast. "Anyway, Bantz had to step down," she said. "And Dora and Kevin were happy to sell the Studio. Plus the deal for five green lights on their own movies, a billion dollars cash in their pockets. And this little Italian guy appears at the Studio, calls a meeting and announces he will be the new owner. And then right out of the blue, he makes me head of the Studio. Skippy was pissed. Now, I'm his boss. Is this crazy?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克劳迪娅还在絮叨个不停，语速很快。“总之，邦茨要下台了。”她说，“而朵拉和凯文很愿意把公司卖掉，条件是给他们自己的五部片子开绿灯，外加十亿美元装到他们个人的口袋里。这时候有个矮小的意大利人出现在公司，开了个会，说自己是这里的新老板了。出人意料的是他任命我当公司的头儿。斯基比气坏了。现在我是他的老板了，这一切听起来是不是有点疯狂？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought of David Redfellow again. Redfellow would violently disagree that there was any such animal. And Cross envisioned how Redfellow had managed everything. Redfellow probably said to the DA, "I'm bribing you to do your duty?" And as for the money, Redfellow would have immediately gone to the limit. Twenty, Cross figured. On a ten-billion buy of the Studio, what the hell was twenty million? And with no risk for the DA. He would be acting strictly according to law. It was really elegant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又想到大卫·雷德菲洛。雷德菲洛肯定会矢口否认存在这种生物。克罗斯在心里想着大卫是如何设计好这一切的。雷德菲洛也许会对检察官这么说：“这是贿赂，但我是在贿赂你让你依法办事。”至于钱，他可能直接就开出最高价。两千万，克罗斯算了算，一百亿买下电影公司，两千万他妈的算什么？而且检察官不用承担任何风险。他只要严格依法办事就行。真是件美差。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="突然，克劳迪娅退后一步看着兄长。她的眼神显得比以前都要更深邃、更犀利、更睿智。但她的脸上仍然绽放着和善的笑容。她说：“跟男人一样，对吧，克罗斯？现在，我就和男人做的事情没什么差别了。而且我也不用跟谁上床…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked over and sat on the couch next to him. "I lied when I said I went to Daddy's funeral just for you.

The Don as well as the others."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走过去，坐在他旁边的沙发里：“我说我去参加爸爸的葬礼只是为了你，我说谎了。我去是因为我想和你和他一样，成为大家的一部分。我去是因为我不想一直逃避下去了。但我的确讨厌他们那一套，克罗斯。唐也是，其他人也是。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Does that mean you don't want to run the Studio?" Cross asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Claudia laughed aloud. "No, I'm willing to admit I'm still a Clericuzio. And I want to make good movies and make a lot of money. Movies are great equalizers, Cross.

<div class="line_cn" title="他拥抱了她，离她这么近感觉真好。克罗斯突然感到一阵软弱，说道：“你知道的，万一我发生不测，我给你留了我三分之一的财产。而且我很有钱。所以你什么时候不想继续在电影公司干都没问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There, Don Clericuzio was waiting for them. Seated in a huge armchair, he was smoking one of his crooked cigars. Vincent went to him and handed him a glass of wine from the bar. Cross was offered nothing. Petie remained at the door, standing. Giorgio sat down on the sofa next to the Don and motioned to Cross to sit with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So Croccifixio," the Don said, "it was all cleverly done. But now you must explain your reasons. I am Dante's grandfather, my daughter is his mother. The men here are his uncles. You must answer to all of us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"A man like Pippi De Lena could never be surprised," Cross said. "And Jim Losey at the other end is too much of a coincidence. There is not a man in this room who believes in coincidence. All of you know Dante was guilty. And Don, you yourself told me the story of the Santadio.

<div class="line_en">The Don did not respond. Cross went on. "How could I not avenge my father? How could I forget my father was responsible for my life?

<div class="line_en">There was a long silence and then finally the Don raised his head to all of them and spoke. "Funerals are wasted on the young," he said. "What have they done to celebrate them? How have they inspired great respect? The young have no compassion, no gratitude. And my daughter is already crazy, why should we compound her grief and erase hopes for her recovery. She will be told her son has fled and it will take years for her to know the truth."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Don sighed as if in regret. "You will sign over half your interest but you must move out of our world. Vazzi must return to Sicily with his family, or not, as he pleases. That is as far as I can go. You and Vazzi must never speak together again. And I order my sons, in your presence, never to avenge their nephew's death. You will have a week to arrange your affairs, to sign the necessary papers for Giorgio." Then the Don spoke in a less harsh voice. "Let me assure you that I had no knowledge of Dante's plans. Now, go in peace and remember I always loved your father like a son."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐叹了口气，好像怀着懊悔：“签字转让吧。把一半财产过户给家族。但是从此你不再是我们的人了。瓦齐必须举家回到西西里，也可以不去，随他喜欢吧。我也只能做这些了。你和瓦齐往后不许再有交谈。而且我当着你的面，对我的儿子们下令，绝不能追究他们侄子的死。你有一周时间处理这些问题、签完字的文件给乔治。”然后唐舒缓语调道，“我向你保证，我对丹特的计划一无所知。现在平平安安地去吧，还有记住，我一直把你的父亲视如己出。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Cross left the house, Don Clericuzio got out of his chair and said to Vincent, "To bed." Vincent helped him up the stairs, for the Don now had a certain weakness in his legs. His age was finally beginning to ravage his body.</div>
