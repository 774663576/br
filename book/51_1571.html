<div class="line_en">For a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance. Obviously Haymitch isn't much, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing, once we're in the arena he's all we've got. As if by some unspoken agreement, Peeta and I each take one of Haymitch's arms and help him to his feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it's enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可惜甜饼的盒子扔在地上，正好砸在铁道边一簇蒲公英上。我只看了一眼，但已经足够了，它使我想起了多年前学校操场的那朵蒲公英…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had just turned away from Peeta Mellark's bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn't lost. I plucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and Prim's hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After we'd harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until we'd filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread.</div>

Neat handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them, when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence. It was the first time I'd been there alone, without my father's weapons to protect me. But I retrieved the small bow and arrows he'd made me from a hollow tree. I probably didn't go more than twenty yards into the woods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, I had the good luck to kill a rabbit. I'd shot a few rabbits before, with my father's guidance. But this I'd done on my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，在放学的路上，我在“牧场”边久久流连，最后终于鼓足勇气从围障低下钻了过去。这是我第一次一个人站在这个地方，没有爸爸的弓箭的保护。我找到了爸爸用挖空的一截树干给我做的弓和箭。那天，我往“牧场”里面走的距离大概不超过二十码。有很长时间，我呆在一棵老橡树的树杈上，静静地等着猎物经过。几个小时后，我运气不错，打到一只兔子。以前爸爸教过我，我也曾打到过几只兔子。可这只兔子，是完全靠自己打到的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit farther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was determined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and you're dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I harvested with my father's pictures. I kept us alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树林子成了我们的救星，每天我都会往里多走一点。一开始很艰难，但我下定决心，无论如何也要自己养活家人。我从鸟窝偷鸟蛋，用网子捕鱼，有时打松鼠和兔子，什么都干，我还挖遍地都是的各种野菜。挖野菜要小心，有的可以吃，有的吃上一口就能要命。挖野菜时，按照爸爸的图片仔细反复地检查，我们吃得野菜都安全。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We hadn't had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim had gathered. Then she acted confused and went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a bowl.</div>

<div class="line_en">On May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up for my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prim's toy wagon. On the eighth of every month, I was entitled to do the same. I couldn't stop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn't absolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was frightening to enter that place without my father at my side, but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter who'd shot it. I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasn't around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a passion for strawberries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五月八号，我去法院大楼签字领取食品券，用波丽姆的玩具车把我第一次领到的粮食和油拖回家。每月的八号，我都去领一回。当然，打猎也没停。粮食不够吃，还要买些别的东西，比如肥皂、牛奶和针线。除了必须吃的，其它的我都拿到集市上去换。起初，没有爸爸的陪伴我感到很害怕，可大家都尊敬爸爸，也就接受了我。猎物就是猎物，无论是谁打到了它。我还把猎物拿到有钱人家的后门去卖，我尽量回忆起爸爸教给我的办法，自己也学会了几招新的。肉铺老板只买兔子，不买松鼠。面包房老板喜欢松鼠，他老婆不在身边时，他就换一只，就换一只。警局局长喜欢野火鸡，市长对草莓情有独钟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Any sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first. Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on. Bears and cats lived deeper in, perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要有一点危险的信号――远处传来的嚎叫，树枝发出的噼啪声――我会立刻跑回到围障边。慢慢地，我冒险爬到树上躲避那些不停找寻猎物的野狗。熊和豹子躲在林子深处，也许它们不喜欢我们区的烟熏味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter. People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, I heard her singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="渐渐地，妈妈的精神又恢复了，回到我们身边。她开始打扫房间、做饭、储存我带回的过冬食物。人们常和我们换些东西，也付给我们药钱。有一天，我终于听到了她的歌声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants growing around me. Tall with leaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that don't look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. "Katniss," I said aloud. It's the plant I was named for. And I heard my father's voice joking, "As long as you can find yourself, you'll never starve." I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top. That night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were all, for the first time in months, full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一年的夏末，我在池塘洗澡，不经意看到周围生长的植物，高高的茎、像箭一样的叶子、长着三片花瓣的白色花朵。我跪在水里，指尖插进松软的泥中，随手挖出它的根茎。这小小淡蓝色的茎块虽然看着不像马铃薯，但吃起来味道却一模一样。“凯特尼斯”（凯特尼斯是印地安语中一种水生植物的名称――译者注）我大声喊道。我的名字就是根据这种植物起的。我似乎听到爸爸诙谐的声音在耳边说：“只要能找到你自己，你就不会饿死。”我花了几个小时，用手和木棍把池塘底翻了个遍，把飘在水面上的茎块全捡了起来。那晚，我们吃着鱼和凯特尼斯根，直到我们吃得饱饱的。这是一个月来的头一次，我们所吃的饱饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Prim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn't trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈好了，波丽姆高兴极了。可我却冷眼旁观，等着她再次从我们身边离开。我并不信任她。我内心深处藏着对她的憎恨，憎恨她的脆弱、她的不管不顾、她一个月来对我们的离弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

In the distance, I see the lights of another district. 7? 10? I don't know. I think about the people in their houses, settling in for bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn tight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? Were they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the strawberries? Or did it lie untouched on their plates? Did they watch the recap of the day's events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my mother holding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sister's fragile shoulders?</div>

<div class="line_en">The moment I slide into my chair I'm served an enormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week. There's an elegant glass of orange juice. At least, I think it's orange juice. I've only even tasted an orange once, at New Year's when my father bought one as a special treat. A cup of coffee. My mother adores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only tastes bitter and thin to me. A rich brown cup of something I've never seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚在椅子上坐下，就有人端来了一大盘食物，有鸡蛋、火腿、成堆的炸薯条，一个盛满了水果的果盘镇在冰块里，以使之冰凉适口。堆在我面前的一堆蛋卷够我们家吃一星期的。一只雅致的杯子里盛着桔汁；或者，至少我认为是桔汁。我以前只在新年时尝过爸爸作为特殊礼物带回来的一只橘子。另外还有一杯咖啡。妈妈特别喜欢咖啡，可我们从来都买不起。但咖啡对我来说，只是又苦又稀的水。还有一杯浓浓的褐色的东西，我从没见过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When my stomach feels like it's about to split open, I lean back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasn't paid much attention to his platter, but he's knocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it's some kind of spirit. I don't know Haymitch, but I've seen him often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor. He'll be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我的肚子感觉快要裂开时，我才靠在椅子上，吃佐餐小食品。皮塔仍在吃，把蛋卷撕开，浸在热巧克力里。黑密斯并没有太在意他的食物，可他却不停地从一个瓶子里倒出透明液体混在红色果汁里，然后一口喝下。那浓烈的味道让我可以断定那准是一种酒精。我与黑密斯以前并不认识，但我在黑市那经常见到他，他总把大把的零钱扔在卖白酒的女人的柜台上。这样下去，我们到达凯匹特时，他肯定会酩酊大醉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes never stand a chance. It isn't just that we've been underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors and he's a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes -- either because they're betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner -- expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现自己很讨厌黑密斯。难怪十二区的选手从来没得到过好机会，这不仅因为他们食不果腹、缺乏训练――十二区有很多强健的选手，有机会取胜；而是因为他们得不到赞助，而黑密斯是主要原因。有钱人往往会支持某些选手，抑或他们在这些选手身上下了注，抑或仅仅要吹嘘自己选对了胜出者。当然他们愿与比黑密斯举止更得体的人打交道。">查看中文翻译</div>

Instead he sits back and squints at us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯一愣，接着一拳打在皮塔下巴上，把他从椅子上掀倒在地。他转过身要去拿酒，我把刀子猛地插在瓶子和他手之间，差点叉到他的手指头。接着我赶快闪身，好躲开他的拳头，可他却没动手，坐在椅子是，乜斜着眼看着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's some advice. Stay alive," says Haymitch, and then bursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember I'm having nothing more to do with him. I'm surprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so mild.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我建议你，活着回来。”黑密斯说着，大笑起来。我和皮塔交换了一个眼色，决心再也不与他搭话了。我当时看到他眼神里的冷酷感到非常吃惊，而他平时是一贯温和的呀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bow and arrow is my weapon. But I've spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well. Sometimes, if I've wounded an animal with an arrow, it's better to get a knife into it, too, before I approach it. I realize that if I want Haymitch's attention, this is my moment to make an impression. I yank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then throw it into the wall across the room. I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam between two panels, making me look a lot better than I am.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弓箭是我常用的武器，可是抛刀子我也练了好长时间。有时我射伤了猎物，靠它之前，最好先用刀子把它结果了。我觉得要引起黑密斯的注意，现在正是时候。我把刀子从桌子上猛拉出来，手抓刀刃，嗖地一下把它扔到对面的墙上。我本来只想把刀子牢牢地扎在墙上，可刀子却正好卡在两块板子的缝隙里，显得我更加身手不凡。">查看中文翻译</div>

There are still a few lights inside, but outside it's as if night has fallen again. I realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the Capitol. The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts. It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels. This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to scale the mountains, they were easy targets for the Capitol's air forces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么‘可是’，别反抗就是了。”黑密斯说着，从桌上拿着酒瓶，然后离开了餐车。门在他身后关上时，餐车内黑漆漆的，尽管还有一丝光亮，但车外面好像进入黑夜。我想火车准是进了通往凯匹特的隧道。这些大山是凯匹特防御东部各区的天然屏障，从东面几乎无法攻进凯匹特，只有隧道这一条通路。这地形优势是各区打败仗，也是我现在成了“贡品”的主要原因。因为反叛者要穿越大山，他们很容易就成为凯匹特空中力量的打击目标。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment. We can't help it. Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what we've only seen on television, the Capitol, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras haven't lied about its grandeur. If anything, they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow of hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal. All the colors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright, the yellows painful to the eyes, like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District 12.</div>
