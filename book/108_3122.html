<div class="line_en">Sonja used to say that Ove had only admitted he was wrong on one occasion in all the years they had been married, and that was in the early 1980s after he'd agreed with her about something that later turned out to be incorrect. Ove himself maintained that this was a lie, a damned lie. By definition he had only admitted that she was wrong, not that he was.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Loving someone is like moving into a house," Sonja used to say. "At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren't actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfection, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爱上一个人就像搬进一座房子，”索雅曾说，“一开始你会爱上新的一切，陶醉于拥有它的每一个清晨，就好像害怕会有人突然冲进房门指出这是个错误，你根本不该住得那么好。但经年累月房子的外墙开始陈旧，木板七翘八裂，你会因为它本该完美的不完美而渐渐不再那么爱它。然后你渐渐谙熟所有的破绽和瑕疵。天冷的时候，如何避免钥匙卡在锁孔里；哪块地板踩上去的时候容易弯曲；怎么打开一扇橱门又恰好可以不让它嘎吱作响。这些都是会赋予你归属感的小秘密。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove looks at her with boundless disappointment, as if she really hasn't listened to anything he's said. He's made an effort to educate this pregnant woman in the fundamentals of owning a car. He's explained that one has to change one's car every three years to avoid losing money. He has painstakingly run through what all people who know anything are well aware of, namely that one has to drive at least twelve thousand miles per year to save any money by opting for a diesel rather than a gas engine. And what does she do? She starts blabbering, disagreeing as usual, debating things like "surely you don't save money by buying a car new" and it must depend on "how much the car costs." And then she says, "Why?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维绝望地看着她，就像她根本没听见他说的话。他正在这儿跟个孕妇讲解拥有一辆车的基础知识。他解释说三年换一辆车才不会亏钱，他还有板有眼地说有脑子的人都知道一年跑三千两百公里以上才会选柴油发动机。而她在干什么？她像往常一样还嘴。开口就是“买新的怎么可能省钱”，又说这和“车的价钱”有关，接着还问“为什么”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm just saying surely it depends on the cost of the diesel engine? And what its consumption is per mile?" says Parvaneh unconcernedly, slowing the Saab down at a red light and trying, with some grunts, to settle herself more comfortably in her seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我只是说这当然关系到柴油发动机的价钱，还有每公里的耗油量。”帕尔瓦娜漫不经心地说着，在红灯前放慢车速，哼哼一声调整了一下坐姿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove, of course, suspected that he represented the wardrobe door in the example. And from time to time he heard Sonja muttering that "sometimes I wonder if there's anything to be done, when the whole foundations are wonky from the very start" when she was angry with him. He knew very well what she was driving at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维曾经一直怀疑他就是比喻里的那扇橱门。他时不时也会听见索雅念叨：“有时候也会忍不住想想，要是房子的地基本来就打歪了的话，还能有什么办法补救。”特别是生他气的时候，他很清楚她这话是什么意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove gets out of the car without answering. There wasn't much wrong with the meal last night, he can stretch to admitting that. Although Ove doesn't feel there's a need to make such a palaver about cooking, as Parvaneh does. Meat and potatoes and gravy are perfectly adequate. But if one has to complicate things like she does, Ove could possibly agree that her rice with saffron is reasonably edible. It is. So he had two portions of it. And the cat had one and a half.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维一声不吭地跨出车门。昨天的晚饭还真不赖，这他不得不承认。也并不是欧维觉得现在应该特别点评一下帕尔瓦娜的厨艺。肉和土豆加点酱其实就不错。当然要是非要让他对她的厨艺发表一点儿意见的话，欧维很可能会承认那个加藏红花烧的米饭还是可以入口的。本来就是嘛。反正他是吃了两大碗。连猫都吃了一碗半。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the way back along the hall he'd gone past the seven-year-old's room. She was sitting in front of her computer, of course, tapping away. This seemed to be all kids did these days, as Ove understood it. Patrick had explained that he'd "tried to give her newer games but she only wanted to play that one," which made Ove more favourably disposed both to the seven-year-old and to her computer game. Ove liked people who didn't do what Patrick told them to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回客厅的路上欧维经过七岁女孩的房间，她还坐在那儿摆弄着电脑。现在的小孩儿整天尽干这个，欧维心里明白。但帕特里克解释说他“想给她买新游戏”来着，但她就想玩现在那个，这倒让欧维既对七岁女孩也对电脑游戏产生了好感。他喜欢不照着帕特里克的话做的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After dinner, while Patrick washed up, the three-year-old had demanded that Ove read her a bedtime story. Ove found it very difficult to reason with the little troll, because she didn't seem to understand normal argumentation, so he followed her with dissatisfaction through the front hall towards her room and sat on her bedside, reading to her with his usual "Ove-excitement," as Parvaneh once described it, although Ove didn't know what the hell she meant by that. When the three-year-old fell asleep with her head partly on his arm and partly on the open book, Ove had put both her and the cat in the bed and turned out the light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭后，帕特里克洗碗的时候，三岁女孩央求欧维在她睡觉前给她念个故事。欧维想着跟这个小妖怪很难理论，她应该听不懂什么大道理，于是只好垂头丧气地跟着她穿过客厅，去她的房间，靠在她的床边念起书来。帕尔瓦娜称之为“欧维式同情心”。欧维根本不明白她他妈到底是什么意思。当三岁女孩半靠着欧维的胳膊半靠着打开的书昏昏欲睡的时候，欧维把她和猫咪一起在床上安顿好，关掉灯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He stepped into the room and stood beside her. She looked up from the computer with the dour expression this kid always seemed to lug about with her, and in fact she didn't seem too pleased about his presence. But when Ove stayed where he was, she pointed at last to an upside-down storage crate, made of plastic, on the floor. Ove sat down on it. And she started quietly explaining to him that the game was about building houses and then making cities out of the houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他迈进房间站到她身边。她从电脑显示屏上挪开视线抬起头，面带惯常的那副不满神情，对欧维的存在不为所动。但看到欧维没有离开的意思，她终于还是伸手指了指倒扣在地板上的一个塑料收纳盒。欧维坐了上去。然后她开始平静地跟欧维解释，这个游戏其实就是造房子，然后用这些房子建造城市。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were drawings everywhere on the walls in her room. Black-and-white pencil sketches, mostly. Not at all bad, considering they had been created by the absence of deductive faculties and highly undeveloped motor function of a seven-year-old, Ove was willing to admit. None of them were of people. Only houses. Ove found this extremely engaging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她房间的墙壁上到处是画，大部分是黑白铅笔素描。鉴于这些画出自一个运动机能和逻辑思维都还没有发育健全的七岁女孩之手，欧维不得不承认，还真不赖。没有一张画上有人。只有房子。欧维觉得这很讨喜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove looked at her. She looked at him. Ove put his index finger on the screen, leaving a large fingerprint, pointing at an empty space of the town and asking her what happened if she clicked that spot. She moved her cursor there and clicked, and in a flash the computer had put up a house there. Ove looked fairly suspicious about it. Then he made himself comfortable on the plastic box and pointed at another empty space. Two and a half hours later Parvaneh stomped in angrily and threatened to pull out the plug if they didn't call it a night at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维看看她，她也看看欧维。欧维用食指在显示器上按了个巨大的指纹后，指着城里一块空地问，她要是在这儿点点会怎么样。她把鼠标挪到那里点了一下，电脑马上飞快地在那儿建了个房子，欧维一脸困惑。然后他在盒子上坐好，又指了指另一块空地。两个半小时后，帕尔瓦娜怒气冲冲地走进房间威胁说他们俩再不去睡觉就把电线给拔了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Ove stood in the doorway getting ready to leave, the seven-year-old carefully tugged at his shirtsleeve and pointed at a drawing on the wall right next to him. "That's your house," she whispered, as if it was a secret between her and Ove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维站在门框里刚要离开的时候，七岁女孩小心翼翼地拉住了他的袖口，指着紧挨着他的一张画。“那是你的房子。”她压低嗓音，就好像这是她和欧维之间重大的秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He leaves Parvaneh in the parking area, crosses the street, opens the glass door, and steps in. The café is empty. The fan heater overhead coughs as if it's full of cigar smoke. Amel stands behind the counter in a stained shirt, wiping glasses with a white towel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把帕尔瓦娜留在停车场，穿过马路，打开玻璃门走进屋。咖啡馆里空荡荡的，天花板上的暖风机咳得像个老烟鬼。阿迈尔站在柜台背后，穿着脏兮兮的衬衣，用一块白抹布擦着玻璃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His stocky body has sunk into itself, as if at the end of a very long breath. His face bears that combination of deep sorrow and inconsolable anger which only men of his generation and from his part of the world seem capable of mastering. Ove stays where he is, in the center of the floor. The two men watch one another for a minute or so. One of them a man who can't bring himself to kick out a homosexual youth from his house, and the other who couldn't stop himself. Eventually Ove nods grimly and sits down on one of the bar stools.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他矮壮的身子蜷缩起来，就像刚吐尽长长的一口气。他的脸上，一半是沮丧，一半是只有他这代人以及他的那部分世界才能挥洒自如的无情怒火。欧维站在房间中央，两个男人互相注视片刻。一个人无法拒绝那个同性恋男孩留宿家中，另一个人则无法容忍。最后欧维严肃地自顾点点头，上前一步坐到其中一张吧台凳上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Amel's chest rises and falls in a couple of jerky breaths under the stained shirt. At first he seems to be considering opening his mouth, but then he thinks again. In silence he finishes wiping his glasses. Folds up the towel and puts it next to the espresso machine. Disappears into the kitchen without a word. Comes back with two glasses and a bottle, the letters on the label illegible to Ove. Puts these down on the counter between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迈尔的胸膛在脏衬衣下起伏片刻。起初他看上去像是要开口的样子，但最后还是忍住了，沉默着擦干玻璃。叠好抹布，放到意式浓缩咖啡机旁。一言不发地钻进厨房，回来的时候拿着个瓶子，标签上的字母欧维不认得，还拿了两个玻璃杯。他把瓶子和杯子往他们之间的柜台上一放。">查看中文翻译</div>
