Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子动了一下，在睡梦中发出微笑，仿佛这些怜悯的表示唤起了某种令人愉快的梦境，那里有他从未领略过的爱心与温情。有的时候，一支亲切的乐曲，一处幽静地方的潺潺水声，一朵花的芳香，甚而只是说出一个熟悉的字眼，会突然唤起一些模糊的记忆，令人想起一些今生不曾出现过的场景，它们会像微风一样飘散，仿佛刹那间唤醒了对某种久已别离的、比较快乐的往事，而这种回忆单靠冥思苦想是怎么也想不起来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你似乎认为，”大夫回道，“露丝小姐，今天在场的每一位，除了你本人而外，都是铁石心肠吧。一般说来，为了成长中的全体男性着想，我希望，当第一个够格的年轻人求你施以怜悯的时候，你也是这样面慈心软，可惜我不是年轻人，否则我一定当场抓住眼前这样有利的机会，我一定会那样做的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," said the doctor, laughing heartily, "that is no very difficult matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn't be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger. Now I make this stipulation -- that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊，”大夫开心地笑了起来。“那决不是什么特别困难的事。还是回头谈谈那个孩子，咱们还没谈到协议的要点呢。过一小时左右他就会醒过来，我敢担保。虽然我已经跟楼下那个死脑筋的警察老弟说了，病人不能搬动或者说话，那会有生命危险，我们大概还是可以跟他淡谈，没有什么危险。现在，我答应――我当着你们的面对们的面对他进行审查，就是说，根据他说的话，我们能作出判断，而且我可以让你们通过冷静的理智看清楚，他本来就是一个不折不扣的坏蛋（这种可能性比较大），那么，他就只能听天由命了，在任何情况下，我也不再插手这事了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day's life brings with it!</div>

<div class="line_en">The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这一次重要的会见刚一结束，奥立弗定下心来，大夫立刻揉了揉眼睛，同时责怪这双眼睛真是不管用了，然后起身下楼，开导凯尔司先生去了。他发现客厅里里外外一个人也没有，不禁想到在厨房里着手进行这些工作可能效果更好一些，就走进了厨房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家公认，大夫是世界上脾气最好的人，他居然以这样吓人的愤怒口气，提出这样一个问题，已经让啤酒和兴奋搞得晕头转向的凯尔司和布里特尔斯大眼瞪小眼，不知如何是好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a simple question of identity, you will observe," said the doctor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I ask you again," thundered the doctor, "are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我再问你们一次，”大夫的声音像打雷一样。“你们俩郑重发誓，你们到底能不能指证那个孩子？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's what it is, sir," replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是这么回事，先生。”警察刚一回答，就拼命咳嗽起来，匆忙中他想把啤酒喝完，结果有一部分啤酒走岔了道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here's the house broken into," said the doctor, "and a couple of men catch one moment's glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here's a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him -- by doing which, they place his life in great danger -- and swear he is the thief. Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人闯进了这房子，”大夫说道，“有两个人曾在刹那间瞥见一个孩子，当时硝烟弥漫，大家心慌意乱，又是一片漆黑。第二天早晨，这所房子来了一个小孩，因为他碰巧又把胳膊吊起来了，这几个人对他大打出手――从而使他的生命处于极度危险之中――还发誓说他就是那个贼。现在的问题是，根据事实，这两个人的行为是否正当，如果属于不正当行为，他们又把自己置于何种境地？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特尔斯大惑不解地看着凯尔司先生，凯尔司先生也大惑不解地看着布里特尔斯，警察将一只手放在耳朵后边，等着听他俩的回答。两个女仆和补锅匠欠起身子倾听着。大夫用犀利的目光环顾四周――就在这时，大门口传来一阵铃声，同时响起了车轮滚动的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn't law, he would be glad to know what was.</div>
