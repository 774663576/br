<div class="line_en">It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. But he hardly noticed his surroundings. All he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. One was only a metre or two from him, the other was further away, near the door. He was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to look straight in front of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know, whereabouts he was in the windowless building. Possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. The cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level. The room where he had been interrogated by O'Brien was high up near the roof. This place was many metres underground, as deep down as it was possible to go.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had moved a little to one side, so that Winston had a better view of the thing on the table. It was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. Fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature in each. They were rats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他朝一侧稍微移动了一下，以便让温斯顿更清楚地看到桌子上的东西。这是一只椭圆形的铁丝笼，上面有把手可以拎着。它的前面是某种看上去像击剑面罩一样的东西，朝外有个凹口。虽然离他三四米远，他可以看见这笼子纵向分成两格。每一格里都有某种活物。是老鼠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door opened again. A guard came in, carrying something made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. He set it down on the further table. Because of the position in which O'Brien was standing. Winston could not see what the thing was.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The worst thing in the world," said O'Brien, "varies from individual to individual. It may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. There are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not even fatal."</div>

<div class="line_en">A sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had passed through Winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage. But at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him. His bowels seemed to turn to water.</div>

<div class="line_en">O'Brien made no direct answer. When he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. He looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind Winston's back.</div>

There was something terrible on the other side of the wall. You knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it into the open. It was the rats that were on the other side of the wall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你记得梦中常出现的恐怖时刻吗？”奥布莱恩问，“你面前有一堵黑墙，你听到某种咆哮的声音。墙后面有某种可怕的东西。你其实知道那是什么，但你不敢把它打开。墙后面就是老鼠。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">O'Brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table. He set it down carefully on the baize cloth. Winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. He had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. He was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away from him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of grey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥布莱恩拎起笼子，走到最近的那张桌子，小心地把笼子放在粗呢桌布上。温斯顿能听到耳朵里血液汹涌的声音。他觉得孤立无援。他像坐在一块大空地的中间，一块太阳暴晒的沙漠，各种声音从远处向他奔腾而来。然而，这鼠笼离他只有两米远。那是些大老鼠，已经长到鼻口又秃又凶猛，毛发从灰色变为棕色的年龄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"By itself," he said, "pain is not always enough. There are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death. But for everyone there is something unendurable -- something that cannot be contemplated. Courage and cowardice are not involved. If you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. If you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. It is merely an instinct which cannot be destroyed. It is the same with the rats. For you, they are unendurable. They are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand, even if you wished to. You will do what is required of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“疼痛本身，”他说，“并非总是有效。有时人能抵御疼痛，甚至到死亡那一刻。但每个人都会有某种难于承受的东西——某种想都不敢想的东西。这与勇敢和胆怯无关。如果你从高空坠落，抓住一根绳子，这并非怯懦。如果你从水底挣扎着浮起来吸气，也并非怯懦。这只是难以抵抗的本能。说到老鼠，情况也一样。就你而言，老鼠是受不了的东西。它们是你难以抵御的重压，哪怕你想抵御也不行。你只能做有求于你的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It seemed to reach Winston from far away. The rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each other through the partition. He heard also a deep groan of despair. That, too, seemed to come from outside himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="笼子里发出一阵尖叫声，好像从远处传到温斯顿的耳朵里。老鼠在争斗，想钻过分隔区撕咬对方。他也听到一声绝望的呻吟。那也像是从他身外传来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The rat," said O'Brien, still addressing his invisible audience, "although a rodent, is carnivorous. You are aware of that. You will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. In some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. The rats are certain to attack it. Within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. They also attack sick or dying people. They show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老鼠，”奥布莱恩说，仍然在对着看不见的听众作讲解，“虽然是啮齿动物，但也是食肉动物。你想必知道这一点。你听说过发生在城里贫民区的事情。在有些街上，母亲不敢把孩子单独留在房子里，即使离开五分钟。老鼠肯定会咬孩子。短短一刻，它们会把孩子吃得只剩骨头。它们还会攻击病人和即将死去的人。它们表现出惊人的聪明，知道人什么时候无能为力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">O'Brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it. There was a sharp click. Winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. It was hopeless; every part of him, even his head, was held immovably. O'Brien moved the cage nearer. It was less than a metre from Winston's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥布莱恩拎起笼子，并按了一下里面的什么东西，传出尖锐的咔嗒一声。温斯顿疯狂地想要把自己从椅子上撕开。但无济于事，他的每个部位，甚至他的头，都被绑得不能动弹。奥布莱恩将笼子又拿近些，离温斯顿的脸不足一米。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have pressed the first lever," said O'Brien. "You understand the construction of this cage. The mask will fit over your head, leaving no exit. When I press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up. These starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. Have you ever seen a rat leap through the air? They will leap on to your face and bore straight into it. Sometimes they attack the eyes first. Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我按了第一道操纵杆，”奥布莱恩说，“你知道这个笼子的结构。这个面罩对你的头正合适，没有空隙。当我按动另一个操纵杆，笼子的门就会打开。这些饥饿的野兽就会像子弹一样射出来。你见过老鼠空中跳跃吗？它们会朝你的脸跳起，直扑过来。有时它们会首先咬你的眼睛。有时它们在你脸上咬出一个洞，吃你的舌头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. But he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a split second left -- to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone black. For an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea. There was one and only one way to save himself. He must interpose another human being, the BODY of another human being, between himself and the rats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="笼子更近了，越来越近。温斯顿听到一阵阵尖锐的叫声，好像从他头上方发出的。他猛烈地同他的恐慌搏斗。想啊，想啊，即使只剩下一秒钟——想是唯一的希望。突然，他闻到了老鼠的恶臭。他感到一阵强烈的恶心，他几乎失去了知觉。眼前一片漆黑。他一时成了疯狂尖叫的动物。然而，他在黑暗中产生了一个想法。只有一个办法，唯一的办法能救他自己。他必须拖上另一个人，另一个身体，置于他和老鼠之间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mask was closing on his face. The wire brushed his cheek. And then -- no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. Too late, perhaps too late. But he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just ONE person to whom he could transfer his punishment -- ONE body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面罩离他的脸越来越近。铁丝触到了他的面颊。接着——不，不可能逃脱，只是希望，一丝希望。太晚了，也许太晚了。但他突然明白，在整个世界上，只有一个人他可以转嫁他的刑罚——一个身体他可以置于他自己和老鼠之间。于是，他疯狂地大叫起来，一遍又一遍：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. The rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless, mindless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面罩的开口很大，足以将其他的景象拒之门外。铁丝笼门离他的脸只有两巴掌远。此刻老鼠知道送上来的是什么。一只老鼠上下跳跃着，另一只老鼠，一只肮脏的下水道大老鼠直立着，前爪抓着笼门，鼻子猛烈地嗅着。温斯顿可以看见鼠须和黄牙。他又感到极度的恐慌。他眼前发黑、孤立无援、失魂落魄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. He was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars -- always away, away, away from the rats. He was light years distant, but O'Brien was still standing at his side. There was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. But through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open.</div>
