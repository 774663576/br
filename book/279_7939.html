<div class="line_en">After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous fried–egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh–colored "tights" very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus-with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等玩得累极了，他们就跑到岸上，四肢朝天，往又干又热的沙滩的一躺，拿沙子盖住自己。过一会儿，又冲进水里，再打一次水仗。后来他们忽然想起，自己身上裸露的皮肤完全可以当成是肉色的“紧身衣”，这样他们就在沙滩上划了个大圆圈，开始演马戏——由于互不相让，谁也不愿失去扮演这最神气角色的机会，结果台上出现了三个小丑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ring–taw" and "keeps" till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the "dumps," and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing "BECKY" in the sand with his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再后来，他们就拿出石头弹子，玩“补锅”、“敲锅”和“碰着就赢”，一直玩到兴尽意阑为止。然后乔和哈克又去游泳，但汤姆却没敢去冒这个险，因为他发现刚才他踢掉裤子时，把拴在脚踝上的一串响尾轮也给踢飞了。他很纳闷没有这个护身符保佑，刚才玩闹这么久，居然没有出事。后来他找回了护身符，这才敢去玩，但这时另外两个伙伴已经玩累了，准备歇一歇。于是他们就“道不同不相为谋”，个个意兴索然，不由得眼巴巴地望着宽阔的大河对岸出神，那里他们向往的小镇正在阳光下打盹。汤姆发现自己不由自主地用脚趾头在沙滩上写“贝基”。他把字迹抹掉，对自己大为恼火，恨自己意志薄弱。然而，他还是情不自禁地又写了这个名字。他再一次把名字擦掉，为了防止再写下去，他把两个伙伴弄到一处，自己也和他们一块儿玩起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom's heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes.

He made a plausible excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.</div>

After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grape–vine, and they "bit" the tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe said feebly:</div>

<div class="line_en">So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是哈克重新坐下来等着。一个小时后，他觉得有些孤单，便动身去找同伴。他俩东一个，西一个相去甚远，脸色苍白地倒在林中睡大觉。他看得出他们俩抽烟不太适应，不过现在这种难受已经过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well-something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them.</div>

<div class="line_en">About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grass–blade, separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the tree–tops right over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick gloom that followed. A few big rain–drops fell pattering upon the leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜半光景，乔醒了，叫另外两个孩子。空气闷热逼人，似乎要变天。尽管天气又闷又热令人窒息，几个孩子还是相互依偎在一起，尽力靠近那堆火。他们全神贯注默默坐在那里，等待着。周围还是一片肃静。除了那堆火，一切都被漆黑的夜色吞噬了。不一会儿，远处划过一道亮光，隐约照在树叶上，只一闪便消失了。不久，又划过一道更强烈的闪光。接着又一道。这时候，穿过森林的枝叶，传来一阵低吼声，几个孩子仿佛觉得有一股气息拂过脸颊，以为是幽灵过去了，吓得瑟瑟发抖。一阵短暂的间隙过后，又是一道悚目惊心的闪光，把黑夜照得亮如白昼，他们脚下的小草也历历可辨；同时，三张惨白、惊惧的脸也毕露无遗。一阵沉雷轰轰隆隆当空滚过，渐去渐远，消失在遥远的天边。一阵凉风袭来，树叶沙沙作响，火堆里的灰，雪花似地四处飞撒。又一道强光照亮了树林，响雷紧随其后，仿佛就要把孩子们头顶上的树梢一劈两半。之后，又是一团漆黑，几个孩子吓得抱成一团，几颗大雨点噼哩啪啦砸在树叶上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming thunder–blasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river–bank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies, everything below stood out in clean–cut and shadowless distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spume–flakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloud–rack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging thunder–peals came now in ear–splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to the tree–tops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们撒腿就跑，黑暗中不时绊上树根和藤蔓，由于极度害怕，他们拼命地朝不同方向跑。一阵狂风呼啸而过，所到之处，簌簌作响。耀眼的闪电一道紧跟着一道，震耳的雷声一阵尾随着一阵。片刻之间，倾盆大雨劈头泼下，阵阵狂风又沿着地面把它们刮成了一片片雨幕。孩子们相互呼喊着，可是风吼雷啸，把他们的呼喊声完全盖住了。不过，他们终于一个接一个地冲回了露营地，在帐篷底下躲起来，又冷又怕，浑身精湿。好在在这样恶劣的环境下，大家守在一块，总算是不幸中的万幸。他们讲不出话来，因为那块旧帆篷噼噼啪啪响得太厉害，这么大的噪音实在没法交谈。狂风越刮越猛，不久便吹断了系帆篷的绳子，把它一卷而飞。孩子们手挽着手，逃向河岸上一棵大橡树底下躲雨，一路上磕磕绊绊，碰破了许多地方。这时候，天空中风、雨、闪、雷交加，狂暴至极。闪电把天空也照亮了，把天宇下的万物映衬得分外鲜明；被风吹弯的树木、白浪翻腾的大河、大片随风飞舞的泡沫以及河对岸高耸的悬崖峭壁的模糊轮廓，都在那飞渡的乱云和斜飘的雨幕中乍隐乍现。每隔一会，就有一棵大树不敌狂风，哗啦一声扑倒在小树丛中；惊雷如潮，震耳欲聋，惊魂夺魄，难以言状。最后的这一阵暴风雨更是威力无比，似乎要在片刻之间，把这个小岛撕成碎片，烧成灰烬，淹没树顶，再把它吹个无影无踪，要把岛上的生灵都震昏震聋。对这几个离家出走的孩子们来说，这一夜实在够他们受的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything in camp was drenched, the camp–fire as well; for they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were glad–hearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露营地的一切都被大雨淋透了，那堆篝火也给浇灭了。这几个孩子毕竟缺乏经验，就像他们的同龄人一样，没有想到要去防雨。更倒霉的是，他们都成了落汤鸡，冷得受不了。那副狼狈相不言自喻。不过他们很快发现，原先那堆火已经把他们靠着生火的那根倒在地上的大树干（在它弯起离地面有些距离的地方）烧得凹进去很深，因此有块巴掌大的地方没有被雨淋湿。于是他们极有耐性地想方设法，从那些有遮掩的树下，寻来些碎叶、树皮做火引子，总算又把那堆火救活了。随后他们又添了许多枯树枝，让火苗呼呼直窜，这才感到兴高采烈。他们把熟火腿烘干，炮餐一顿。吃罢就坐在火堆旁，把夜半的历险大肆渲染一番，一直聊到清早，因为周围没有一处能睡觉的干地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and stiff–jointed, and a little homesick once more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras-all of them chiefs, of course-and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.</div>

<div class="line_en">They assembled in camp toward supper–time, hungry and happy; but now a difficulty arose-hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed, in due form.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临近吃晚饭时分，他们才回到宿营地集合，饥肠辘辘，但却十分快活；不过，又一个难题产生了——互相仇杀的印第安人如不事先讲和，是不能在一块友好进餐的，而讲和的前提必须要抽一袋烟。他们从没听说过还有别的讲和办法。这三个野蛮人中的两个几乎一致表示希望继续当海盗。大家终究想不出别的解决办法；所以他们只好装出一副愉悦神情，把烟斗要过来，按照传统的仪式轮流抽了一口。">查看中文翻译</div>
