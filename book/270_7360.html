<div class="line_en">"Aren't you going to open it?" she asked. She sighed when I didn't move immediately, and tugged the top of the box off herself.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不打算打开它吗？”她问道。看见我没有马上行动她叹了叹气，自己用力拉开了盒盖，然后拉出什么，把它攀起来，但是我无法注意到那是什么，很漂亮，难道你不这样认为吗？我挑了蓝色的，因为我知道那是爱德华最喜欢你穿的颜色。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Remember what Edward said? About someone using the holes in your vision to keep you from seeing the newborns? And then what you said before, about the timing being too perfect -- how careful my thief was to make no contact, as if he knew you would see that. I think you were right, Alice, I think he did know. I think he was using those holes, too. And what are the odds that two different people not only know enough about you to do that, but also decided to do it at exactly the same time? No way. It's one person. The same one. The one who is making the army is the one who stole my scent."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝不习惯出其不意。她僵直地站在那里，一动不动地站了好久，以至于我等待的时候不由自主地开始在脑子里数数了。整整有两分钟她动都没动一下，接着她的眼睛重新看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was through expecting my emotions to make sense anymore. As I processed the fact that someone had created an army of vampires -- the army that had gruesomely murdered dozens of people in Seattle -- for the express purpose of destroying me, I felt a spasm of relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经不指望我的情绪再有理性可言了。想到有人创造了一支吸血鬼军队——这支军队在西雅图令人发指地谋杀了几十个人——就是为了明确表示他们的目标是摧毁我，此时我感到一阵如释重负。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Edward had it wrong," I whispered. "It was a test… to see if it would work. If he could get in and out safely as long as he didn't do anything you would be watching out for.

<div class="line_en">Charlie had gotten stubborn last week when he'd learned that I was intending to ride with Edward to the graduation ceremony. And I could see his point -- parents should have some rights come graduation day. I'd conceded with good grace, and Edward had cheerfully suggested that we all go together. Since Carlisle and Esme had no problem with this, Charlie couldn't come up with a compelling objection; he'd agreed with poor grace. And now Edward rode in the backseat of my father's police car, behind the fiberglass divider, with an amused expression -- probably due to my father's amused expression, and the grin that widened every time Charlie stole a glance at Edward in his rearview mirror. Which almost certainly meant that Charlie was imagining things that would get him in trouble with me if he said them out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理上个星期得知我打算搭乘爱德华的车去参加毕业典礼的时候，表现得很顽固不化。我明白他的意思——父母应该有权参加毕业日。我友好地让步了，爱德华高兴地建议我们一起去。由于卡莱尔和埃斯梅对此毫无疑义，查理就想不出什么更体面的借口反对了，他非常不友好地同意了。现在爱德华坐在我爸爸警车的后排座位上，隔着纤维玻璃脸上露出一副开心的表情——很可能是因为我爸爸的表情很好玩吧，查理从观后镜里偷偷瞟着爱德华的时候，脸上露出更加得意的笑容。这差不多肯定地表示查理正在想一些让他和我为难的事情，如果他说出口的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had my back to the front windows, and I resisted the urge to turn around and search for the eyes I could feel on me now. I knew I wouldn't be able to see anything. Just as I knew there was no chance that he would leave me unguarded, even for a second. Not after this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我背对着前面的窗户，抵抗着转过身直视此刻正在搜寻我的那双眼睛的冲动，我知道我不会看见什么。只是我知道他不会让我有不受到保护的时候，哪怕只有一秒钟，发生这样的事情之后更不会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dinner dragged. Charlie, busy socializing, ate too slowly. I picked at my burger, stuffing pieces of it into my napkin when I was sure his attention was somewhere else. It all seemed to take a very long time, but when I looked at the clock -- which I did more often than necessary -- the hands hadn't moved much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="饭吃得拖拖拉拉的，查理忙于交际吃得太慢了，我挑了一块汉堡包，确定他的注意力在别处的时候把面包屑塞进我的餐巾里。整个过程似乎花了很长时间，但是当我看钟的时候——我看钟的频率实在是太高了——指针根本没怎么走动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally Charlie got his change back and put a tip on the table. I stood up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于查理拿回了找零，把小费放在桌上，我站了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I want to help Alice set things up," I claimed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想帮爱丽丝准备东西去。”我声称。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay." He turned away from me to say goodnight to everyone. I went out to wait by the cruiser.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。”他转身背对着我跟大家道晚安，我则走出去在巡逻车旁等他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In a hurry?" he asked me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很着急？”他问我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned against the passenger door, waiting for Charlie to drag himself away from the impromptu party. It was almost dark in the parking lot, the clouds so thick that there was no telling if the sun had set or not. The air felt heavy, like it was about to rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我靠在乘客座这边的门上，等待查理从临时的派对上慢腾腾地脱身出来。停车场里几乎都天黑了下来，乌云那么厚，根本无从辨别太阳是否下山了。空气很闷，好像要下雨了一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bella?" Charlie called from the doorway of the restaurant, squinting into the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉？”查理从餐厅的门口喊道，眯起眼睛在黑暗中寻找我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he disagreed. "This is something I needed to know. I can't believe I didn't see it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不”，他不这么认为，“这是我需要知道的事情，我简直不敢相信我没看出来是这样！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么样？”他一松开我我就问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll follow you there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会跟着你过去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without a word, he pulled me tightly against his chest. One cool hand found my chin, and pulled my face up so that he could press his hard lips to mine. I could feel the tension in his jaw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一把拉着我，一句话都没说，紧紧地把我抱在怀里。一只冰凉的手摸到了我的下巴，使我抬起头，这样他就可以用他那坚硬的嘴唇吻我的双唇了，我能感觉到他下巴上的紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, how do you feel?" he asked me as we drove north along the highway. "It's been a big day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你感觉如何？”我们沿着高速公路一路朝北开的时候，他问我“今天可是个大日子啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah," I lied again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”我又撒谎道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He snorted. "Maybe. But I'm sure I slipped up in a few places. I mean, look at your hand!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他嗤之以鼻：“或许吧，但是我确定有些地方我做得不够好。我的意思是，瞧瞧你的手。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是傻，我感觉自己总是没有做我应该为你做的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed, seeing through me easily. "Worried about the party?" he guessed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他大笑起来，一眼就看穿了，“很担心派对？”他猜测道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time he didn't notice. "You were never one for the parties."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次他没注意到，“你从来都不喜欢派对。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't be silly, Dad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别傻了，爸爸。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stared down blankly at my hands. My left hand rested lightly on the dark brace I rarely thought about. My broken knuckle didn't hurt much anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我茫然地低头看自己的手。我的左手轻轻地躺在黑色的矫形套上，我几乎都忘了有这么回事了。我骨折的关节不再那么痛了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's ridiculous. You do a fantastic job. World's best dad. And…" It wasn't easy to talk about feelings with Charlie, but I persevered after clearing my throat. "And I'm really glad I came to live with you, Dad. It was the best idea I ever had. So don't worry -- you're just experiencing post-graduation pessimism."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这很可笑，你做得棒极了，世界上最好的爸爸……”和查理谈感情不是件容易的事情，不过在我清好嗓子之后我有些保留地说道。而且我真的很高兴过来和你一起生活，爸爸。这是我想到过的最好的主意，所以别担心——你只不过正在经历毕业后的悲观情绪罢了。”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I feel fine," I lied.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不管我站在哪边，如果有人没经过你的同意而吻你，你就应该能够在不伤害到自己的情况下，让对方明白你的感受。你没有把大拇指塞在拳头里，对吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“还有下一次？”我难以置信地问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Dad. That's kind of sweet in a weird way, but I don't think lessons would have helped. Jacob's head is really hard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，爸爸。那样给人的感觉倒是种奇怪的甜蜜，但是我认为给我上课起不了什么作用，雅各布的头真的很硬。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="查理摆出一副苦相，眯着眼睛看着挡风玻璃前面黑黢黢的一片。查理喜欢派对的程度差不多跟我一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where's the turnoff, again?" he asked. "They ought to clear out their drive -- it's impossible to find in the dark."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“岔道在哪儿？”他问道，“他们应该清理车道——黑黢黢的根本找不到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe," Charlie said as the road curved to the east. "Or maybe not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧，”查理说道，路弯向了东面，“或许不会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black velvet darkness was interrupted ahead, just where the Cullens' drive should be. Someone had wrapped the trees on either side in thousands of twinkle lights, impossible to miss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑色天鹅绒般的黑夜在前面就被打破了，那里应该就是卡伦家的车道。有人在马路两边的树上裹上了成千上万只霓虹灯，这样就不可能错过了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just around the next bend, I think." I pursed my lips. "You know, you're right -- it is impossible to find. Alice said she put a map in the invitation, but even so, maybe everyone will get lost." I cheered up slightly at the idea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想就在下一个拐弯的地方。”我嘟起嘴巴，“您知道，您是对的——很难找到。爱丽丝说过她在请柬上画了地图的，但是即便如此，或许大家还是会迷路的。”想到这里我稍微开心了一点儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wow," Charlie said as we turned onto the drive. The two trees at the entry weren't the only ones lit. Every twenty feet or so, another shining beacon guided us toward the big white house. All the way -- all three miles of the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哇哦。”我们开上车道的时候查理说道。人口处的两棵树并不是唯一被点亮的树。差不多每隔二十英尺，另一个闪闪发光的灯塔就引领着我们开往那座大房子。一路上都有——足足有三英里。">查看中文翻译</div>
