<div class="line_en">Outside the rain still fell, but within the Twins the air was thick and hot. A fire roared in the hearth and rows of torches burned smokily from iron sconces on the walls. Yet most of the heat came off the bodies of the wedding guests, jammed in so thick along the benches that every man who tried to lift his cup poked his neighbor in the ribs. Even on the dais they were closer than Catelyn would have liked. She had been placed between Ser Ryman Frey and Roose Bolton, and had gotten a good noseful of both. Ser Ryman drank as if Westeros was about to run short of wine, and sweated it all out under his arms. He had bathed in lemonwater, she judged, but no lemon could mask so much sour sweat. Roose Bolton had a sweeter smell to him, yet no more pleasant. He sipped hippocras in preference to wine or mead, and ate but little.</div>

<div class="line_en">The drums were pounding, pounding, pounding, and her head with them. Pipes wailed and flutes trilled from the musicians' gallery at the foot of the hall; fiddles screeched, horns blew, the skins skirled a lively tune, but the drumming drove them all. The sounds echoed off the rafters, whilst the guests ate, drank, and shouted at one another below. WaIder Frey must be deaf as a stone to call this music. Catelyn sipped a cup of wine and watched Jinglebell prance to the sounds of "Alysanne. " At least she thought it was meant to be "Alysanne." With these players, it might as easily have been "The Bear and the Maiden Fair."</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Roslin's smile had a fixed quality to it, as if someone had sewn it onto her face. Well, she is a maid wedded, but the bedding's yet to come. No doubt she's as terrified as I was. Robb was seated between Alyx Frey and Fair Walda, two of the more nubile Frey maidens. "At the wedding feast I hope you will not refuse to dance with my daughters," Walder Frey had said. "It would please an old man's heart." His heart should be well pleased, then; Robb had done his duty like a king. He had danced with each of the girls, with Edmure's bride and the eighth Lady Frey, with the widow Ami and Roose Bolton's wife Fat Walda, with the pimply twins Serra and Sarra, even with Shirei, Lord Walder's youngest, who must have been all of six. Catelyn wondered whether the Lord of the Crossing would be satisfied, or if he would find cause for complaint in all the other daughters and granddaughters who had not had a turn with the king. "Your sisters dance very well," she said to Ser Ryman Frey, trying to be pleasant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的萝丝琳表情却有些不自然，好似在强颜欢笑。可怜的闺女，新婚之夜，接下来还要闹洞房，一定像当年的我那么害怕。罗柏坐在艾茜·佛雷和“美女瓦妲”这两位佛雷家的闺女中间。“等婚宴开始，希望您不会拒绝和我的女儿们跳舞，”瓦德·佛雷曾说，“就当是安慰一位老人的心灵吧。”如今罗柏履行了身为国王的全部责任，瓦德大人应该感到满意。之前的成婚仪式上，他跟每个女人都跳过，其中包括艾德慕的新娘和第八任佛雷夫人，寡妇阿蕊丽和卢斯·波顿的老婆“胖子瓦妲”，一脸疙瘩的双胞胎西拉和撒拉，甚至还与希琳——瓦德大人六岁的小女儿——共舞。凯特琳不知老人是得意洋洋，还是不满有的孙女没有轮到被国王邀请的机会。“你的姐妹们跳得真不错。”她试着对莱曼·佛雷爵士露出笑颜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You would never guess Edmure complained of Roslin all the way from Riverrun to the TWins. Husband and wife ate from a single plate, drank from a single cup, and exchanged chaste kisses between sips. Most of the dishes Edmure waved away. She could not blame him for that. She remembered little of the food served at her own wedding feast. Did I even taste it? Or spend the whole time gazing at Ned's face, wondering who he was?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真想不到，为了萝丝琳，弟弟愿将奔流城到孪河城的一路辛苦完全置之度外。新婚夫妇同盘用餐，同杯饮酒，还不时亲热接吻，而一道道菜还没端上便先被艾德慕挥开，她不禁回忆起自己成婚时的情景，那时的我比弟弟更紧张。我到底吃过没？是不是一直都盯着奈德的脸，暗暗嘀咕这庄严陌生的北方人？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catelyn could not fault him for his lack of appetite. The wedding feast began with a thin leek soup, followed by a salad of green beans, onions, and beets, river pike poached in almond milk, mounds of mashed turnips that were cold before they reached the table, jellied calves' brains, and a leche of stringy beef. It was poor fare to set before a king, and the calves' brains turned Catelyn's stomach. Yet Robb ate it uncomplaining, and her brother was too caught up with his bride to pay much attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对恐怖堡伯爵的胃口贫乏，凯特琳深表同情。婚宴的第一道菜是稀韭菜汤，接着来了青豌豆、洋葱和甜菜做的色拉、杏仁奶炖河鱼、烤鸭、堆成小山状的碎芜菁——这道菜还没上桌就冷掉了、凝结的牛脑花和牛筋。这些东西怎配招待国王呢？凯特琳尝了点牛脑花，只觉胃里翻涌。好在罗柏没有抱怨，一丝不苟地吃着，而弟弟艾德慕的注意力全放在新娘身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A sour man, and in his cups, Catelyn thought. The Late Lord Frey might be niggardly when it came to feeding his guests, but he did not stint on the drink. The ale, wine, and mead were flowing as fast as the river outside. The Greatjon was already roaring drunk. Lord Walder's son Merrett was matching him cup for cup, but Ser Whalen Frey had passed out trying to keep up with the two of them. Catelyn would sooner Lord Umber had seen fit to stay sober, but telling the Greatjon not to drink was like telling him not to breathe for a few hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无趣的醉汉！凯特琳心想。迟到的佛雷侯爵虽对食物吝啬，饮料方面却丰富慷慨。麦酒、葡萄酒和蜜酒就跟城下的河水一样滔滔不绝。大琼恩喝得酩酊大醉，他一杯又一杯地拼倒惠伦·佛雷爵士，又对上瓦德大人另一个儿子梅里。凯特琳希望安柏伯爵保持起码的清醒，但要劝大琼恩别喝酒，就好比要他别呼吸一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smalljon Umber and Robin Flint sat near Robb, to the other side of Fair Walda and Alyx, respectively. Neither of them was drinking; along with Patrek Mallister and Dacey Mormont, they were her son's guards this evening. A wedding feast was not a battle, but there were always dangers when men were in their cups, and a king should never be unguarded. Catelyn was glad of that, and even more glad of the swordbelts hanging on pegs along the walls. No man needs a longsword to deal with jellied calves' brains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小琼恩·安柏和罗宾·菲林特坐在罗柏旁边，与国王之间只隔了艾茜·佛雷和“美女瓦妲”，此二人外加派崔克·梅利斯特及黛西·莫尔蒙均滴酒未沾，因为他们共同组成国王今晚的私人护卫。婚宴不是战场，但杯盏间难保无意外发生，而国王乃是万金之躯。凯特琳很满意这番安排，也很满意地看到大厅墙上挂满剑带。这些可不是用来对付牛脑花的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lord of the Dreadfort paid the chatter no mind, Catelyn saw. Sometimes he tasted a bite of this, a spoon of that, tearing bread from the loaf with short strong fingers, but the meal could not distract him. Bolton had made a toast to Lord Walder's grandsons when the wedding feast began, pointedly mentioning that Walder and WaIder were in the care of his bastard son. From the way the old man had squinted at him, his mouth sucking at the air, Catelyn knew he had heard the unspoken threat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐怖堡伯爵对这番闲话毫无表示。他时而咬咬牛肉，时而喝一汤匙，时而用粗短的指头撕点面包，但心思显然没在饭局上。婚宴开始时，他为瓦德大人两个孙子的健康向老人敬酒，并保证两位瓦德在他私生儿子的周全保护下，绝无任何危险。老侯爵眯眼回瞪，嘴唇左右蠕动，凯特琳明白他很清楚其中的威胁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Everyone thought my lord would choose Fair Walda," Lady Walda Bolton told Ser Wendel, shouting to be heard above the music. Fat Walda was a round pink butterball of a girl with watery blue eyes, limp yellow hair, and a huge bosom, yet her voice was a fluttering squeak. It was hard to picture her in the Dreadfort in her pink lace and cape of vair. "My lord grandfather offered Roose his bride's weight in silver as a dowry, though, so my lord of Bolton picked me." The girl's chins jiggled when she laughed. "I weigh six stone more than Fair Walda, but that was the first time I was glad of it. I'm Lady Bolton now and my cousin's still a maid, and she'll be nineteen soon, poor thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人人都以为我夫君会选择美女瓦妲。”瓦妲·波顿夫人用盖过乐声的尖叫告诉文德尔爵士。胖子瓦妲像个粉红的圆球，长着水汪汪的蓝眼睛、软塌的黄头发和一对巨乳，声音尖得出奇，难以想象她换上恐怖堡的粉红色裙服与裘皮斗篷是什么样子。“可是呢，祖父大人允诺以新娘等体重的银子作嫁妆，所以波顿大人就挑了我哟！”她边笑，肥胖的下巴边抖，“我比美女瓦妲足足重六石，这回终于体现价值了！我成了波顿夫人，她还是个处女，可怜的家伙，快满十九岁了哩！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Was there ever a wedding less joyful? she wondered, until she remembered her poor Sansa and her marriage to the Imp. Mother take mercy on her. She has a gentle soul. The heat and smoke and noise were making her sick. The musicians in the gallery might be numerous and loud, but they were not especially gifted. Catelyn took another swallow of wine and allowed a page to refill her cup. A few more hours, and the worst will be over. By this hour tomorrow Robb would be off to another battle, this time with the ironmen at Moat Cailin. Strange, how that prospect seemed almost a relief. He will win his battle. He wins all his battles, and the ironborn are without a king. Besides, Ned taught him well. The drums were pounding. Jinglebell hopped past her once again, but the music was so loud she could scarcely hear his bells.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是老天，世上竟有如此沉闷的婚宴？她不禁想，直到想起宝贝的珊莎嫁给了小恶魔。圣母慈悲！我的小淑女啊…热气、烟雾和噪声让她恶心，楼台上那群乐师更是莫名地吵闹、出奇地不称职。凯特琳干了杯中酒，让侍酒重新满上。再坚持几个钟头就好。明日此时，罗柏就将率军出征，前去讨伐卡林湾的铁民。她从中感到几许欣慰。儿子一定能得胜而回。奈德把他教导得很好，北军战无不胜，铁民又没了国王。鼓声咚、咚、咚，铃铛响又一次经过面前，但音乐实在太吵，听不见铃铛的响声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Above the din came a sudden snarling as two dogs fell upon each other over a scrap of meat. They rolled across the floor, snapping and biting, as a howl of mirth went up. Someone doused them with a flagon of ale and they broke apart. One limped toward the dais. Lord Walder's toothless mouth opened in a bark of laughter as the dripping wet dog shook ale and hair all over three of his grandsons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然传来一阵吠叫，两只狗为一片碎肉大打出手。它们在地板上翻滚、厮咬和攻击，人们号叫喝彩。最后有人操起麦酒当头淋下，才把它们分开。其中一只跳上高台，看见这湿淋淋的畜生摇晃躯体，将污水抖到三个孙子身上，瓦德大人不由得张开无牙的嘴巴，乐得大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

Lord Umber wiped his mouth, stood, and began to sing. "A bear there was, a bear, a BEAR! All black and brown and covered with hair!" His voice was not at all bad, though somewhat thick from drink. Unfortunately the fiddlers and drummers and flutists up above were playing "Flowers of Spring," which suited the words of "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" as well as snails might suit a bowl of porridge.

A second feast, for knights and lords of somewhat lesser rank, was roaring along in the other castle, she knew. Lord Walder had exiled his baseborn children and their offspring to that side of the river, so that Robb's northmen had taken to referring to it as "the bastard feast." Some guests were no doubt stealing off to see if the bastards were having a better time than they were. Some might even be venturing as far as the camps. The Freys had provided wagons of wine, ale and mead, so the common soldiers could drink to the wedding of Riverrun and the Twins.</div>

With so many siblings, she was not like to be a stranger to the custom, but it was different when you were the one being bedded. On Catelyn's own wedding night, Jory Cassell had torn her gown in his haste to get her out of it, and drunken Desmond Grell kept apologizing for every bawdy joke, only to make another.

To which Ser Marq Piper threw back, "I hear that Frey women have two gates in place of one!" and Alyx said, "Aye, but both are closed and barred to little things like you!"

She tensed, until she saw that others had stayed as well. Petyr Pimple and Ser Whalen Frey slept on, their heads on the table. Merrett Frey poured himself another cup of wine, while Jinglebell wandered about stealing bites off the plates of those who'd left. Ser Wendel Manderly was lustily attacking a leg of lamb.

Catelyn saw a second bolt pierce his leg, saw him fall. Up in the gallery, half the musicians had crossbows in their hands instead of drums or lutes. She ran toward her son, until something punched in the small of the back and the hard stone floor came up to slap her. "Robb!" she screamed. She saw Smalljon Umber wrestle a table off its trestles. Crossbow bolts thudded into the wood, one two three, as he flung it down on top of his king. Robin Flint was ringed by Freys, their daggers rising and falling. Ser Wendel Manderly rose ponderously to his feet, holding his leg of lamb. A quarrel went in his open mouth and came out the back of his neck.

<div class="line_en">"Jeyne?" Robb grabbed the edge of the table and forced himself to stand. "Mother," he said, "Grey Wind…"</div>

<div class="line_en">She pressed the blade deeper into jinglebell's throat. The lackwit rolled his eyes at her in mute appeal. A foul stench assailed her nose, but she paid it no more mind than she did the sullen ceaseless pounding of that drum, boom doom boom doom boom doom. Ser Ryman and Black Walder were circling round her back, but Catelyn did not care. They could do as they wished with her; imprison her, rape her, kill her, it made no matter. She had lived too long, and Ned was waiting. It was Robb she feared for. "On my honor as a Tully," she told Lord Walder, "on my honor as a Stark, I will trade your boy's life for Robb's. A son for a son." Her hand shook so badly she was ringing Jinglebell's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把匕首压进铃铛响的咽喉，这痴呆转转眼珠，发出无言的控诉。污秽的体臭熏进鼻孔，但这不重要，都不重要。鼓声连绵窒闷，咚、咚、咚、咚、咚、咚。莱曼爵士和黑瓦德摸到身后，她浑不在意。他们想怎样就怎样，抓她，操她，杀她，虐她，一切都没关系。她已活得够久，只想早日回到奈德身边。尘世的牵挂只剩罗柏。“以我身为徒利家人的荣誉，”她告诉瓦德·佛雷，“以我身为史塔克家人的荣誉，我愿用您这位孩子的生命来交换罗柏的生命，一个儿子换一个儿子。”她摇晃铃铛响的头，手抖得厉害。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Boom, the drum sounded, boom doom boom doom. The old man's lips went in and out. The knife trembled in Catelyn's hand, slippery with sweat. "A son for a son, heh," he repeated. "But that's a grandson… and he never was much use."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咚，鼓声继续，咚、咚、咚、咚。老人嘴唇蠕动不停。凯特琳手上满是汗珠，匕首握持不住。“一个儿子换一个儿子，嘿，”对方重复，“可他只是个孙子…还是个没用的孙子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to Robb. "Jaime Lannister sends his regards." He thrust his longsword through her son's heart, and twisted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一名身披缀满血点的淡红披风的黑甲武士急步走到罗柏面前。“我代表詹姆·兰尼斯特，向您致以亲切问候。”他将长剑戳进国王的心脏，拧了一拧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally someone took the knife away from her. The tears burned like vinegar as they ran down her cheeks. Ten flerce ravens were raking her face with sharp talons and tearing off strips of flesh, leaving deep furrows that ran red with blood. She could taste it on her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于有人将匕首扳开。泪水犹如毒药，流过她的面庞。十只尖利而凶猛的鸦爪从天而降，撕破脸孔，抓烂皮肤，留下深深的沟纹。血、血、血，滴进嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It hurts so much, she thought. Our children, Ned, all our sweet babes. Rickon, Bran, Arya, Sansa, Robb… Robb… please, Ned, please, make it stop, make it stop hurting… The white tears and the red ones ran together until her face was torn and tattered, the face that Ned had loved. Catelyn Stark raised her hands and watched the blood run down her long fingers, over her wrists, beneath the sleeves of her gown. Slow red worms crawled along her arms and under her clothes. It tickles. That made her laugh until she screamed. "Mad," someone said, "she's lost her wits," and someone else said, "Make an end," and a hand grabbed her scalp just as she'd done with Jinglebell, and she thought, No, don't, don't cut my hair, Ned loves my hair. Then the steel was at her throat, and its bite was red and cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robb had broken his word, but Catelyn kept hers. She tugged hard on Aegon's hair and sawed at his neck until the blade grated on bone. Blood ran hot over her fingers. His little bells were ringing, ringing, ringing, and the drum went boom doom boom.</div>
