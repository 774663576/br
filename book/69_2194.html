He was dressed in warm enough garments, a thickly padded and quilted coal-silk anorak and fur boots, but they had a secondhand look and didn't fit well.

The sledges had stopped to rest the dogs, and suddenly there they all were, Farder Coram, Lord Faa, Lee Scoresby, all lunging forward to help and then falling back silent as they saw the other figure with Lyra.

<div class="line_en">He listened, and then took the lid of a biscuit tin and deftly folded it into a small flat cylinder. She marveled at the skill of his hands: unlike most bears, he and his kin had opposable thumb claws with which they could hold things still to work on them; and he had some innate sense of the strength and flexibility of metals which meant that he only had to lift it once or twice, flex it this way and that, and he could run a claw over it in a circle to score it for folding. He did this now, folding the sides in and in until they stood in a raised rim and then making a lid to fit it. At Lyra's bidding he made two: one the same size as the original smokeleaf tin, and another just big enough to contain the tin itself and a quantity of hairs and bits of moss and lichen all packed down tight to smother the noise. When it was closed, it was the same size and shape as the alethiometer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听了她的想法以后，便拿出一个盛饼干的马口铁盒子上的盖子，灵巧地把它折叠成一个光滑的小圆筒。他的手那么灵巧，这让莱拉感到十分惊奇；他跟大多数熊不一样，他和他的同类的大拇指与其他手指处于相对的位置，这样他们就可以紧紧抓住物体，进行操作；他对金属的力度和弹性有着某种天生的判断力，也就是说，他只需把金属扳动一两下，向左右弯几下，用爪子在上面画个圆圈，做个记号，就可以卷动了。他现在就是在这样做，把金属的边向上卷起来，让它们最终直立起来，形成一个边缘，然后又给它做了一个合适的盖子。在莱拉的要求下，他做了两个：一个跟原来那个马口铁杯子一样大，另一个则刚好装得下那个马口铁杯子，两者中间紧紧塞了一些毛发、苔藓和地衣，以便挡住那个东西发出来的噪音。等盖上盖子之后，这个杯子就跟真理仪一般大了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Who knows? I have never seen a symbol reader, nor anyone who could read them. Perhaps you are different from others." He dropped to all fours again and went on gnawing his meat. Lyra had unfastened her furs, but now the cold was striking in again and she had to do them up. All in all, it was a disquieting episode. She wanted to consult the alethiome-ter there and then, but it was too cold, and besides, they were calling for her because it was time to move on. She took the tin boxes that lorek Byrnison had made, put the empty one back into Farder Coram's kit bag, and put the one with the spy-fly in it together with the alethiometer in the pouch at her waist. She was glad when they were moving again.</div>
