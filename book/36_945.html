<div class="line_en">A lovely home atmosphere is one of the flowers of the world, than which there is nothing more tender, nothing more delicate, nothing more calculated to make strong and just the natures cradled and nourished within it. Those who have never experienced such a beneficent influence will not understand wherefore the tear springs glistening to the eyelids at some strange breath in lovely music. The mystic chords which bind and thrill the heart of the nation, they will never know.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the dining-room stood a sideboard laden with glistening decanters and other utilities and ornaments in glass, the arrangement of which could not be questioned. Here was something Hurstwood knew about. He had studied the subject for years in his business. He took no little satisfaction in telling each Mary, shortly after she arrived, something of what the art of the thing required. He was not garrulous by any means. On the contrary, there was a fine reserve in his manner toward the entire domestic economy of his life which was all that is comprehended by the popular term, gentlemanly. He would not argue, he would not talk freely. In his manner was something of the dogmatist. What he could not correct, he would ignore. There was a tendency in him to walk away from the impossible thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hurstwood's residence could scarcely be said to be infused with this home spirit. It lacked that toleration and regard without which the home is nothing. There was fine furniture, arranged as soothingly as the artistic perception of the occupants warranted. There were soft rugs, rich, upholstered chairs and divans, a grand piano, a marble carving of some unknown Venus by some unknown artist, and a number of small bronzes gathered from heaven knows where, but generally sold by the large furniture houses along with everything else which goes to make the "perfectly appointed house."</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a time when he had been considerably enamoured of his Jessica, especially when he was younger and more confined in his success. Now, however, in her seventeenth year, Jessica had developed a certain amount of reserve and independence which was not inviting to the richest form of parental devotion. She was in the high school, and had notions of life which were decidedly those of a patrician. She liked nice clothes and urged for them constantly. Thoughts of love and elegant individual establishments were running in her head. She met girls at the high school whose parents were truly rich and whose fathers had standing locally as partners or owners of solid businesses. These girls gave themselves the airs befitting the thriving domestic establishments from whence they issued. They were the only ones of the school about whom Jessica concerned herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Young Hurstwood, Jr., was in his twentieth year, and was already connected in a promising capacity with a large real estate firm. He contributed nothing for the domestic expenses of the family, but was thought to be saving his money to invest in real estate. He had some ability, considerable vanity, and a love of pleasure that had not, as yet, infringed upon his duties, whatever they were. He came in and went out, pursuing his own plans and fancies, addressing a few words to his mother occasionally, relating some little incident to his father, but for the most part confining himself to those generalities with which most conversation concerns itself. He was not laying bare his desires for any one to see. He did not find any one in the house who particularly cared to see.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Hurstwood was the type of woman who has ever endeavoured to shine and has been more or less chagrined at the evidences of superior capability in this direction elsewhere. Her knowledge of life extended to that little conventional round of society of which she was not -- but longed to be -- a member. She was not without realisation already that this thing was impossible, so far as she was concerned. For her daughter, she hoped better things. Through Jessica she might rise a little. Through George, Jr.'s, possible success she might draw to herself the privilege of pointing proudly. Even Hurstwood was doing well enough, and she was anxious that his small real estate adventures should prosper. His property holdings, as yet, were rather small, but his income was pleasing and his position with Fitzgerald and Moy was fixed. Both those gentlemen were on pleasant and rather informal terms with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this atmosphere Hurstwood had moved for a number of years, not thinking deeply concerning it. His was not the order of nature to trouble for something better, unless the better was immediately and sharply contrasted. As it was, he received and gave, irritated sometimes by the little displays of selfish indifference, pleased at times by some show of finery which supposedly made for dignity and social distinction. The life of the resort which he managed was his life. There he spent most of his time. When he went home evenings the house looked nice. With rare exceptions the meals were acceptable, being the kind that an ordinary servant can arrange. In part, he was interested in the talk of his son and daughter, who always looked well. The vanity of Mrs. Hurstwood caused her to keep her person rather showily arrayed, but to Hurstwood this was much better than plainness. There was no love lost between them. There was no great feeling of dissatisfaction. Her opinion on any subject was not startling. They did not talk enough together to come to the argument of any one point. In the accepted and popular phrase, she had her ideas and he had his. Once in a while he would meet a woman whose youth, sprightliness, and humour would make his wife seem rather deficient by contrast, but the temporary dissatisfaction which such an encounter might arouse would be counterbalanced by his social position and a certain matter of policy. He could not complicate his home life, because it might affect his relations with his employers. They wanted no scandals. A man, to hold his position, must have a dignified manner, a clean record, a respectable home anchorage. Therefore he was circumspect in all he did, and whenever he appeared in the public ways in the afternoon, or on Sunday, it was with his wife, and sometimes his children. He would visit the local resorts, or those near by in Wisconsin, and spend a few stiff, polished days strolling about conventional places doing conventional things. He knew the need of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫斯渥在这样的气氛里已经生活了多年，从未费心去思索它。他天生不愿烦神去追求更完美的生活，除非那种生活就在面前，和他目前的生活对比鲜明。事实上，他有得有失：他对他们在日常琐事上的自私冷漠感到恼怒，但有时又为他们讲体面摆排场而欣欣然，因为在他看来这有助于提高他们的尊严和社会地位。他经营的酒家，那才是他生活的中心。他大部分时间都泡在那里。傍晚回家时，这家看上去还是很不错的。饭菜是一般仆人能烧出的那种，不过很少有令人难以下咽的时候。此外，对于儿女们的谈话，他也感兴趣，他们看上去气色总是那么好。赫太太爱虚荣，所以总是打扮得花枝招展的。赫斯渥认为，这总比朴素无华要好得多。他们之间已经谈不上爱情了，不过也没有很大的不满。她对任何事物都没有什么惊世骇俗的见解。他们之间谈得不多，所以不至于引起什么争执。照普通流行的说法，他们同床异梦。有时他会遇到某个年轻活泼风趣的女人，相形之下，他的太太似乎大大不如。但是这种艳遇引起的不满是短暂的，因为他必须考虑自己的社会地位和利害得失。他不能让他的家庭关系出毛病，因为这样会影响他和老板的关系，他们不希望出丑闻。担任像他这样职位的人必须举止庄重，名誉清白，有一个体面的家庭立脚。因此他一举一动都很谨慎。下午或者星期天需要到公共场所露面时，他总是带上妻子，有时还加上他的子女。他到当地的游乐场所或者到附近威司康星州的度假地去住上两天时，总是规规矩矩，彬彬有礼，只到人们通常去的地方闲逛，只做人们通常做的事。他知道这样做的必要性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On this account he still devoted some time to showing his wife about -- time which would have been wearisome indeed if it had not been for the people he would meet and the little enjoyments which did not depend upon her presence or absence. He watched her with considerable curiosity at times, for she was still attractive in a way and men looked at her. She was affable, vain, subject to flattery, and this combination, he knew quite well, might produce a tragedy in a woman of her home position. Owing to his order of mind, his confidence in the sex was not great. His wife never possessed the virtues which would win the confidence and admiration of a man of his nature. As long as she loved him vigorously he could see how confidence could be, but when that was no longer the binding chain -- well, something might happen.</div>

<div class="line_en">When some one of the many middle-class individuals whom he knew, who had money, would get into trouble, he would shake his head. It didn't do to talk about those things. If it came up for discussion among such friends as with him passed for close, he would deprecate the folly of the thing. "It was all right to do it -- all men do those things -- but why wasn't he careful? A man can't be too careful." He lost sympathy for the man that made a mistake and was found out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他所认识的许多中产阶级成员中，如果哪个有钱的家伙在私生活上遇到了麻烦，他总是摇摇头，这种事情不谈为妙。假如和那些可以算得上亲密朋友的人们谈起来，他会批评这事干得太愚蠢：“本来这事也算不得什么——哪个男人不做这种事呢——可是他为什么不小心一点呢？一个男人再小心也不为过份的。”他对于那些犯了错误又被人发现的家伙是不同情的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the last year or two the expenses of the family seemed a large thing. Jessica wanted fine clothes, and Mrs. Hurstwood, not to be outshone by her daughter, also frequently enlivened her apparel. Hurstwood had said nothing in the past, but one day he murmured.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nobody knows us down there," said one, a gentleman whose face was a slight improvement over gross ignorance and sensuality.

<div class="line_en">On this trip he enjoyed himself thoroughly, and when it was over he was sorry to get back. He was not willingly a prevaricator, and hated thoroughly to make explanations concerning it.

She drove out more, dressed better, and attended theatres freely to make up for it.</div>
