<div class="line_en">She sent in a little note to Charlie on which she had written: "Please see me, it is urgent." A Chinese boy asked her to wait and brought the answer that Mr. Townsend would see her in five minutes. She was unaccountably nervous. When at last she was ushered into his room Charlie came forward to shake hands with her, but the moment the boy, having closed the door, left them alone he dropped the affable formality of his manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她写了一封短笺：“请与我见面，事情很急。”带着它她来到查理的办公室外。一个中国男孩叫她稍等，过了一会儿他从里面走出来，说唐生先生五分钟之后就可以见她。她不明原因地紧张了一会儿，而后被请进了查理的办公室。他走上前来同她握手，等男孩出去后，门一关上，屋子里就剩他们两个人，他和蔼可亲的面容立即消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a bare room, narrow, with a high ceiling; its walls were painted in two shades of terra cotta. The only furniture consisted of a large desk, a revolving chair for Townsend to sit in and a leather armchair for visitors. It intimidated Kitty to sit in this. He sat at the desk. She had never seen him in spectacles before; she did not know that he used them. When he noticed that her eyes were on them he took them off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里没有什么装饰，也不算宽敞，不过屋顶很高。墙壁上粗陋地抹上了两道赤陶土的图案。屋内仅有的家具是一张大办公桌，一架唐生专用的转椅，还有一张供客人就座的皮质沙发椅。凯蒂坐在这张沙发椅上，感到浑身不自在。他坐在办公桌边，戴了一副眼镜。这还是凯蒂第一次见到他戴眼镜，以前她不知道他还用这东西。他注意到她在盯着自己的眼镜看，就把它摘了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He leaned back in his chair and stared vacantly at the map of China which was hanging on the wall in front of him. She watched him anxiously. She was somewhat disconcerted at the manner in which he had received the news. She had expected him to take her in his arms and tell her he was thankful, for now they could be together always; but of course men were funny. She was crying softly, not now to arouse sympathy, but because it seemed the natural thing to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他靠到椅背上，眼睛茫然地望着对面墙上挂着的一张中国地图。她焦急地看着他，他对这个消息的反应出乎了她的意料。她起初以为他会把她搂到怀里，告诉她谢天谢地，他们终于可以光明正大、永不分开了。不过男人们常常是很有趣的，故意让你拿不准主意。她轻轻地哭着，这次不是为了赢得同情，按情形应当是天经地义的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," she answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”她答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
