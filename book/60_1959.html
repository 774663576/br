<div class="line_en">During the five years that had passed since the Russian army invaded Tomas's country, Prague had undergone considerable changes. The people Tomas met in the streets were different. Half of his friends had emigrated, and half of the half that remained had died. For it is a fact which will go unrecorded by historians that the years following the Russian invasion were a period of funerals: the death rate soared. I do not speak only of the cases (rather rare, of course) of people hounded to death, like Jan Prochazka, the novelist. Two weeks after his private conversations were broadcast daily over the radio, he entered the hospital. The cancer that had most likely lain dormant in his body until then suddenly blossomed like a rose. He was operated on in the presence of the police, who, when they realized he was doomed anyway, lost interest in him and let him die in the arms of his wife. But many also died without being directly subjected to persecution; the hopelessness pervading the entire country penetrated the soul to the body, shattering the latter. Some ran desperately from the favor of a regime that wanted to endow them with the honor of displaying them side by side with its new leaders. That is how the poet Frantisek Hrubin died -- fleeing from the love of the Party. The Minister of Culture, from whom the poet did everything possible to hide, did not catch up with Hrubin until his funeral, when he made a speech over the grave about the poet's love for the Soviet Union. Perhaps he hoped his words would ring so outrageously false that they would wake Hrubin from the dead. But the world was too ugly, and no one decided to rise up out of the grave.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, Tomas went to the crematorium to attend the funeral of a famous biologist who had been thrown out of the university and the Academy of Sciences.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，托马斯到火化馆去参加一个被逐出大学和科学院的著名生物学家的葬礼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The authorities had forbidden mention of the hour of the funeral in the death announcement, fearing that the services would turn into a demonstration. The mourners themselves did not learn until the last moment that the body would be cremated at half past six in the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了防止葬礼变成集会，讣告上禁止写明时间。直到最后一分钟，亲属才被告知死者将在早晨六点半火化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the services were over and everyone had paid his respects to the family of the deceased, Tomas noticed a group of men in one corner of the hall and spotted the tall, stooped editor among them. The sight of him made Tomas feel how much he missed these people who feared nothing and seemed bound by a deep friendship. He started off in the editor's direction with a smile and a greeting on his lips, but when the editor saw him he said, Careful! Don't come any closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仪式结束后，大家与死者家属一一握手，托马斯看到在大厅的一角有一小队人，其中他认出了那个体形高大的驼背记者。这些人个个无所畏惧，当然，他们之间被一种伟大的友情相互维系着，对他们，他不禁又感到了一股思念之情。他走近那个记者，对他微微一笑，想向他问个好，可是这个高大的驼背男人对他说：“小心，大夫，最好不要靠过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Entering the crematorium, Tomas did not understand what was happening: the hall was lit up like a film studio. Looking around in bewilderment, he noticed cameras set up in three places. No, it was not television; it was the police. They were filming the funeral to study who had attended it. An old colleague of the dead scientist, still a member of the Academy of Sciences, had been brave enough to make the funeral oration. He had never counted on becoming a film star.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入火化馆，托马斯简直不能理解所看到的事情：大厅被照得好像电影拍摄场一样。他惊奇地看了看周围，发现大厅的三个角都装上了摄像机。不，这不是电视台在录像，而是警方在拍葬礼的情况，以确认参加葬礼的都是什么人。过世的学者的一个老同事，现在还是科学院的院士，斗胆在棺木前讲了几句话。但他万万没有想到，他就这样成了电影明星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a strange thing to say. Tomas was not sure whether to interpret it as a sincere, friendly warning ( Watch out, we're being filmed; if you talk to us, you may be hauled in for another interrogation ) or as irony ( If you weren't brave enough to sign the petition, be consistent and don't try the old-pals act on us ). Whatever the message meant, Tomas heeded it and moved off. He had the feeling that the beautiful woman on the railway platform had not only stepped into the sleeping car but, just as he was about to tell her how much he admired her, had put her finger over his lips and forbidden him to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话很奇怪。他可以从中体会到这是个真诚而友善的警告（“当心，都被拍下来了，要是您跟我们说话，肯定会受到又一次审讯。”）。但还有一层讽刺的意味是不能抹去的（“您没有勇气在请愿书上签名，理智点吧，不要和我们沾上边！”）。不管是什么样的解释，托马斯都认，于是悄悄走开了。他感觉像是在火车站台上遇到了一个陌生的美人，她正要登上一辆快车的卧铺车厢，当他想要对她表达爱慕之情的时候，那个美人伸出一个手指，放在嘴唇上，不让他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
