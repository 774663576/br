<div class="line_en">No, thought Bran, it is the Nightfort, and this is the end of the world. In the mountains, all he could think of was reaching the Wall and finding the three-eyed crow, but now that they were here he was filled with fears. The dream he'd had… the dream Summer had had… No, I mustn't think about that dream. He had not even told the Reeds, though Meera at least seemed to sense that something was wrong. If he never talked of it maybe he could forget he ever dreamed it, and then it wouldn't have happened and Robb and Grey Wind would still be…</div>

<div class="line_en">All that had happened hundreds and thousands of years ago, to be sure, and some maybe never happened at all. Maester Luwin always said that Old Nan's stories shouldn't be swallowed whole. But once his uncle came to see Father, and Bran asked about the Nightfort. Benjen Stark never said the tales were true, but he never said they weren't; he only shrugged and said, "We left the Nightfort two hundred years ago," as if that was an answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，所有这些故事都发生于千百年前，有些甚至根本没发生过。鲁温学士常说，老奶妈的故事不能囫囵吞下。但某一次叔叔来见父亲时，布兰问起长夜堡，班扬·史塔克没说那些故事是真，也没说是假，只耸耸肩，“我们两百年前就离开了长夜堡。”仿佛这就是答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bran wasn't so certain. The Nightfort had figured in some of Old Nan's scariest stories. It was here that Night's King had reigned, before his name was wiped from the memory of man. This was where the Rat Cook had served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie, where the seventy-nine sentinels stood their watch, where brave young Danny Flint had been raped and murdered. This was the castle where King Sherrit had called down his curse on the Andals of old, where the 'prentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night, where blind Symeon Star-Eyes had seen the hellhounds fighting. Mad Axe had once walked these yards and climbed these towers, butchering his brothers in the dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran forced himself to look around. The morning was cold but bright, the sun shining down from a hard blue sky, but he did not like the noises. The wind made a nervous whistling sound as it shivered through the broken towers, the keeps groaned and settled, and he could hear rats scrabbling under the floor of the great hall. The Rat Cook's children running from their father. The yards were small forests where spindly trees rubbed their bare branches together and dead leaves scuttled like roaches across patches of old snow. There were trees growing where the stables had been, and a twisted white weirwood pushing up through the gaping hole in the roof of the domed kitchen. Even Summer was not at ease here. Bran slipped inside his skin, just for an instant, to get the smell of the place. He did not like that either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰逼自己环顾四周。这天早晨寒冷而明亮，阳光从残酷的青天中照耀而下。他不喜欢那些嘈杂的声音：风穿过残破塔楼发出令人不安的啸叫，要塞吱嘎作响，老鼠在大厅地板下乱爬。那是“鼠厨师”的孩子们在逃避父亲。院子成了小森林，细瘦的树木互相交错光秃的枝杈，枯叶如蟑螂在堆堆积雪上疾走。原本马厩所在之处长出了几棵大树，厨房拱顶上有个洞，一株扭曲的白色鱼梁木从里面挤出来。在这里，就连夏天也感到不安。布兰容许自己钻入他皮下一小会儿，闻闻这地方的味道。他不喜欢那气味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bran had told them there wouldn't be. He had told them and told them, but Jojen Reed had insisted on seeing for himself. He had had a green dream, he said, and his green dreams did not lie. They don't open any gates either, thought Bran.</div>

<div class="line_en">The gate the Nightfort guarded had been sealed since the day the black brothers had loaded up their mules and garrons and departed for Deep Lake; its iron portcullis lowered, the chains that raised it carried off, the tunnel packed with stone and rubble all frozen together until they were as impenetrable as the Wall itself. "We should have followed Jon," Bran said when he saw it. He thought of his bastard brother often, since the night that Summer had watched him ride off through the storm. "We should have found the kingsroad and gone to Castle Black."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从黑衣弟兄们收拾行李，弃守此处，前往深湖居之后，长夜堡的大门就一直封闭：钢铁闸门放下，拉提的链条被卸除，而通道里塞满大大小小的石头，全冻在一起，直到跟长城本身一样难以穿透。“我们该跟琼恩走的。”布兰看到这番景象之后评论。自从那晚透过夏天看着琼恩在暴风雨中骑马逃走，布兰就常想起自己的私生哥哥。“找到国王大道，然后去黑城堡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you said. We are four. You helped your brother, if that was him in truth, but it almost cost you Summer."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know," said Bran miserably. The direwolf had killed three of them, maybe more, but there had been too many. When they formed a tight ring around the tall earless man, he had tried to slip away through the rain, but one of their arrows had come flashing after him, and the sudden stab of pain had driven Bran out of the wolf's skin and back into his own. After the storm finally died, they had huddled in the dark without a fire, talking in whispers if they talked at all, listening to Hodor's heavy breathing and wondering if the wildlings might try and cross the lake in the morning. Bran had reached out for Summer time and time again, but the pain he found drove him back, the way a red-hot kettle makes you pull your hand back even when you mean to grab it. Only Hodor slept that night, muttering "Hodor, hodor," as he tossed and turned. Bran was terrified that Summer was off dying in the darkness. Please, you old gods, he prayed, you took Winterfell, and my father, and my legs, please don't take Summer too. And watch over Jon Snow too, and make the wildlings go away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，”布兰悲哀地说。冰原狼杀了三个野人，或许更多，可对方数目实在惊人，很快便在那没耳朵的人周围紧密集结成一圈。夏天试图溜进雨夜，不料一支箭斜刺里飞来，突然的刺痛把布兰逼出狼形，回到自己的身躯。等雨终于停止，一行四人挤在黑暗中，没有生火，也没大声说话——基本上什么也没说。他们听着阿多沉重的呼吸，担心直到清晨，尤其担心野人们会穿湖过来。布兰不时进入夏天，但疼痛又总是立刻把他驱回，好比灼热的水壶，就算再想提，也不得不抽回手。那晚只有阿多睡着，一边念叨“阿多，阿多”，一边翻来覆去。布兰害怕夏天会在黑暗之中死去。求求你们，远古诸神，他祈祷，你们带走了临冬城，带走了我父亲，带走了我的腿，不要把夏天也带走。也请你们守护琼恩·雪诺，请你们让野人离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No weirwoods grew on that stony island in the lake, yet somehow the old gods must have heard. The wildlings took their sweet time about departing the next morning, stripping the bodies of their dead and the old man they'd killed, even pulling a few fish from the lake, and there was a scary moment when three of them found the causeway and started to walk out… but the path turned and they didn't, and two of them nearly drowned before the others pulled them out. The tall bald man yelled at them, his words echoing across the water in some tongue that even Jojen did not know, and a little while later they gathered up their shields and spears and marched off north by east, the same way Jon had gone. Bran wanted to leave too, to look for Summer, but the Reeds said no. "We will stay another night," said Jojen, "put some leagues between us and the wildlings. You don't want to meet them again, do you?" Late that afternoon Summer returned from wherever he'd been hiding, dragging his back leg. He ate parts of the bodies in the inn, driving off the crows, then swam out to the island. Meera had drawn the broken arrow from his leg and rubbed the wound with the juice of some plants she found growing around the base of the tower. The direwolf was still limping, but a little less each day, it seemed to Bran. The gods had heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="湖中的岩石岛屿上没有鱼梁木生长，然而远古诸神似乎是听到了。第二天早上，野人们不慌不忙地准备启程，扒下自己的死者和那位老人的衣物，甚至还从湖里捞起一些鱼。有那么令人惊恐的一刻，三个人找到堤道，并试图走过来…但堤道拐弯的地方他们没拐，结果两人差点淹死，幸好被拉了上来。高大秃顶的首领朝他们吼叫，话音在湖面上回荡，连玖健都听不懂他使用的语言，片刻之后，对方收拾起盾牌和长矛，朝东北，就是琼恩离开的方向进发。布兰也想离开，去寻找夏天，但被黎德姐弟阻止。“再留一晚，”玖健道，“和野人之间拉开一段距离，再碰上他们可不好，对吧？”欣慰的是，当天下午，夏天拖着一条伤腿从藏身之处返回。他赶走乌鸦，吃了点客栈里的尸体，然后游到岛上。梅拉从他腿上拔出断箭，给伤口抹上某种植物的汁液，那是她在塔楼基座附近找到的。冰原狼仍一瘸一拐，但布兰觉得他每天都有好转。诸神毕竟听见了祈祷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么都行。”梅拉态度坚决地回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It should be me. Bran raised his head to look up at the Wall, and imagined himself climbing inch by inch, squirming his fingers into cracks in the ice and kicking footholds with his toes. That made him smile in spite of everything, the dreams and the wildlings and Jon and everything. He had climbed the walls of Winterfell when he was little, and all the towers too, but none of them had been so high, and they were only stone. The Wall could look like stone, all grey and pitted, but then the clouds would break and the sun would hit it differently, and all at once it would transform, and stand there white and blue and glittering. It was the end of the world, Old Nan always said. On the other side were monsters and giants and ghouls, but they could not pass so long as the Wall stood strong. I want to stand on top with Meera, Bran thought. I want to stand on top and see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事本该由我去做。布兰抬头，看着长城，想像自己一寸一寸地往上爬，手指挖进冰缝中，脚尖踢出落脚处，不由得露出微笑。狼梦、野人和琼恩等等全都不再重要。他打小就攀爬过临冬城的墙垒和所有塔楼，但它们没这么高，而且是石头做的。长城看起来也像石头，灰蒙蒙的，表面坑坑洼洼，但等云层散开，阳光普照，情况就完全不同。它一下子变了样，闪烁着白色和蓝色的莹光。这是世界的尽头，老奶妈常说，对面为怪兽、巨人族和食尸鬼的住所，但只要长城牢牢矗立，它们就都过不来。我想跟着梅拉一起上去，布兰心想，站在上面看一看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wasn't really climbing, the way he used to climb. She was only walking up some steps that the Night's Watch had hewn hundreds and thousands of years ago. He remembered Maester Luwin saying the Nightfort was the only castle where the steps had been cut from the ice of the Wall itself. Or maybe it had been Uncle Benjen. The newer castles had wooden steps, or stone ones, or long ramps of earth and gravel. Ice is too treacherous. It was his uncle who'd told him that. He said that the outer surface of the Wall wept icy tears sometimes, though the core inside stayed frozen hard as rock. The steps must have melted and refrozen a thousand times since the last black brothers left the castle, and every time they did they shrunk a little and got smoother and rounder and more treacherous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她并非在爬，不像以前的他。她只不过沿着守夜人数千年前凿出的阶梯往上走。记得鲁温学士说过，只有长夜堡的楼梯是从长城本身的冰壁里凿出来的。或许这是班扬叔叔说的？往后的城堡都用木楼梯、石楼梯或泥土沙砾混合的长坡道。冰太难捉摸，叔叔如是说，长城尽管内核冻得像石头般坚硬，但表面时而融化，流下冰冷的溪流，犹如哭泣。自从最后一批黑衣弟兄离开城堡，那阶梯一定融化又冻结了上千次，每次都会缩小一点，变得更平整，更圆滑，更危险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And smaller. It's almost like the Wall was swallowing them back into itself. Meera Reed was very surefooted, but even so she was going slowly, moving from nub to nub. in two places where the steps were hardly there at all she got down on all fours. It will be worse when she comes down, Bran thought, watching. Even so, he wished it was him up there. When she reached the top, crawling up the icy knobs that were all that remained of the highest steps, Meera vanished from his sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且更窄小。好像长城要将它们重新收回去。梅拉·黎德脚步稳健，即使如此，还是走得很慢，逐级逐级前进。有两个地方，阶梯几乎消失，她就匍匐着手脚并用。下来更难，布兰心想。最后她终于到达顶端，踏过楼梯最高处仅存的若干冰晶凸起，消失于视线之外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Twice as old as Castle Black," Bran said, remembering. "It was the first castle on the Wall, and the largest." But it had also been the first abandoned, all the way back in the time of the Old King. Even then it had been three-quarters empty and too costly to maintain. Good Queen Alysanne had suggested that the Watch replace it with a smaller, newer castle at a spot only seven miles east, where the Wall curved along the shore of a beautiful green lake. Deep Lake had been paid for by the queen's jewels and built by the men the Old King had sent north, and the black brothers had abandoned the Nightfort to the rats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“比黑城堡古老一倍，”布兰边回忆边说，“它是长城上第一座堡垒，最大的一座。”也是第一座被遗弃的堡垒，早在“人瑞王”的时代。那时候，已有四分之三的房间空着，维护的开销太大。“善良的”亚莉珊王后建议守夜人在东面七里远的地方兴建另一座小规模的新城堡作为代替，在那里，长城沿一个美丽的绿色湖泊弯曲延伸。建造深湖居的费用出自王后变卖的首饰，并由“人瑞王”派人一路前往北方负责修筑，随后，黑衣弟兄们将长夜堡留给了老鼠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are ghosts here," Bran said. Hodor had heard all the stories before, but Jojen might not have. "Old ghosts, from before the Old King, even before Aegon the Dragon, seventy-nine deserters who went south to be outlaws. One was Lord Ryswell's youngest son, so when they reached the barrowlands they sought shelter at his castle, but Lord Ryswell took them captive and returned them to the Nightfort. The Lord Commander had holes hewn in the top of the Wall and he put the deserters in them and sealed them up alive in the ice. They have spears and horns and they all face north. The seventy-nine sentinels, they're called. They left their posts in life, so in death their watch goes on forever. Years later, when Lord Ryswell was old and dying, he had himself carried to the Nightfort so he could take the black and stand beside his son. He'd sent him back to the Wall for honor's sake, but he loved him still, so he came to share his watch."</div>

<div class="line_en">They spent half the day poking through the castle. Some of the towers had fallen down and others looked unsafe, but they climbed the bell tower (the bells were gone) and the rookery (the birds were gone). Beneath the brewhouse they found a vault of huge oaken casks that boomed hollowly when Hodor knocked on them. They found a library (the shelves and bins had collapsed, the books were gone, and rats were everywhere). They found a dank and dim-lit dungeon with cells enough to hold five hundred captives, but when Bran grabbed hold of one of the rusted bars it broke off in his hand. Only one crumbling wall remained of the great hall, the bathhouse seemed to be sinking into the ground, and a huge thornbush had conquered the practice yard outside the armory where black brothers had once labored with spear and shield and sword. The armory and the forge still stood, however, though cobwebs, rats, and dust had taken the places of blades, bellows, and anvil. Sometimes Summer would hear sounds that Bran seemed deaf to, or bare his teeth at nothing, the fur on the back of his neck bristling… but the Rat Cook never put in an appearance, nor the seventy-nine sentinels, nor Mad Axe. Bran was much relieved. Maybe it is only a ruined empty castle.</div>

The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. "And that was the fault in him," she would add, "for all men must know fear." A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.</div>

Then he served him to his father, who praised the taste and had a second slice. Afterward the gods transformed the cook into a monstrous white rat who could only cat his own young. He had roamed the Nightfort ever since, devouring his children, but still his hunger was not sated.

Mad Axe had been a big man in Old Nan's story, and the thing that came in the night had been monstrous. Back in Winterfell, Sansa had told him that the demons of the dark couldn't touch him if he hid beneath his blanket. He almost did that now, before he remembered that he was a prince, and almost a man grown.</div>

This was harder, like trying to pull a left boot on your right foot. It fit all wrong, and the boot was scared too, the boot didn't know what was happening, the boot was pushing the foot away. He tasted vomit in the back of Hodor's throat, and that was almost enough to make him flee. Instead he squirmed and shoved, sat up, gathered his legs under him -- his huge strong legs -- and rose. I'm standing. He took a step. I'm walking. It was such a strange feeling that he almost fell. He could see himself on the cold stone floor, a little broken thing, but he wasn't broken now. He grabbed Hodor's longsword. The breathing was as loud as a blacksmith's bellows.</div>

But the thing that came in the night was screaming too, and thrashing wildly in the folds of Meera's net. Bran saw her spear dart out of the darkness to snap at it, and the thing staggered and fell, struggling with the net. The wailing was still coming from the well, even louder now.

The thing on the floor was pushing an arm through the net to reach his knife, but the loops wouldn't let him. He wasn't any monster beast, or even Mad Axe drenched in gore; only a big fat man dressed up in black wool, black fur, black leather, and black mail. "He's a black brother," said Bran.

<div class="line_en">A turn or two later Sam stopped suddenly. He was a quarter of the way around the well from Bran and Hodor and six feet farther down, yet Bran could barely see him. He could see the door, though. The Black Gate, Sam had called it, but it wasn't black at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又转了一两圈，山姆突然停下。此时他离布兰和阿多四分之一圆周，在下方约六尺处，然而布兰几乎看不见人。但他看得见那道门，山姆口中的“黑门”。它根本不是黑的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A glow came from the wood, like milk and moonlight, so faint it scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself, not even Sam standing right before it. The face was old and pale, wrinkled and shrunken. It looks dead. Its mouth was closed, and its eyes; its cheeks were sunken, its brow withered, its chin sagging. If a man could live for a thousand years and never die but just grow older, his face might come to look like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木头散发出光芒，好似牛奶与月光的混合，如此微弱，除开门本身，几乎不能照亮任何东西，连站在它跟前的山姆也是漆黑一团。那张脸苍白古老，满是褶皱。死气沉沉。嘴闭紧，眼也闭紧，脸颊塌陷，额头枯瘪，下巴松弛。若一个人活上一千岁都死不了，只是越来越老，那么他的脸最后就会像这个样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then pass," the door said. its lips opened, wide and wider and wider still, until nothing at all remained but a great gaping mouth in a ring of wrinkles. Sam stepped aside and waved Jojen through ahead of him. Summer followed, sniffing as he went, and then it was Bran's turn. Hodor ducked, but not low enough. The door's upper lip brushed softly against the top of Bran's head, and a drop of water fell on him and ran slowly down his nose. It was strangely warm, and salty as a tear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去吧，”那扇门说。它的嘴唇张开，越张越大，越张越大，直到最后，除了一圈褶皱包围的大嘴，什么也没剩下。山姆让到一边，挥手示意玖健通过。夏天跟在后面，边嗅边走，然后轮到布兰。阿多弯下腰，但弯得不够低，结果门的上沿轻轻擦过布兰头顶，一滴水落在脸上，沿着鼻子缓缓流淌。它带有奇特的温热，咸如泪水。">查看中文翻译</div>
