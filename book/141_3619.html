<div class="line_en">The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out first, was followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend. Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage. He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="福克先生丝毫没有露出惊奇的神态。这位警察是代表法律的，法律对于任何英国人来说，都是神圣的。路路通呢，他具有法国人脾气，他想跟警察讲理，但是警察用警棍碰了碰他，同时斐利亚·福克作了一个手势要他服从。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, a sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which they took their places and were driven away. No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination. They first passed through the "black town," with its narrow streets, its miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; then through the "European town," which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions, shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts, where, although it was early morning, elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警察带着福克先生、艾娥达夫人和路路通上了一辆四轮四座的马车，驾着两匹马，就这样拉着他们走了。一路上谁也没说一句话。马车先经过“贫民窟”狭窄的街道，街道两旁尽是些矮小的土屋。这些屋子里聚居着很多衣衫褴楼肮脏不堪的“流浪汉”，接着马车又穿过“欧洲区”，这里到处是砖瓦结构的住宅，密茂成荫的椰子树和高大的杉树，使人大有清心悦目之感。虽然还是清晨，可是，威武的骑兵和华丽的马车早已在街头奔驰了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="福克先生只回答说：“不可能是为这件事。为火葬的事抓我们？那绝对不可能！那些僧侣怎敢到这里告状？一定是搞错了。”福克先生接着表示不论如何他也不能丢下艾娥达夫人，他一定要把她送到香港。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Certainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“自然是孟买，不过，不是在庇拉吉庙，而是在孟买玛勒巴山的寺院。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout's escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. Fix's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces. For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain. He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，密探费克斯早已看到，他可以从路路通碰上的这个倒霉的事件里得到好处。于是他就把从孟买动身的时间往后推迟了十二小时，跑到玛勒巴山寺为僧侣们出主意，说他们准能得到一大笔损害赔偿费，因为他很清楚英国玫府对于这一类的罪行是十分严厉的；这样他就叫三个僧侣从孟买坐了下一班火车来追踪他们的犯人。但是斐利亚·福克主仆二人因为援救一个年轻的寡妇，在路上耽搁了一些时间，所以费克斯和这三个印度教的僧侣就在福克主仆二人之前先到达了加尔各答。这时加尔各答的法院也已经接到了电报通知，只等福克他们一下火车，就立即逮捕归案。费克斯到达加尔各答之后，他发现福克先生根本就没有来加尔各答，这时他那种失望的心情是可想而知的。他认为：这个强盗准是在印度半岛铁路线上的某一个车站下了车，一定是在印度北部哪一个地区躲起来了。费克斯焦急不安地在车站上直等了二十四个小时。今天早上，当他看见福克居然陪着一个不知道从哪儿来的年轻女人从火车上下来的时候，他是多么高兴呵，他马上叫一个警察过去把他们抓起来了。这就是福克先生、路路通和本德尔汗德土王的寡妇被带到欧巴第亚法官这儿来的全部经过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="费克斯象是脊梁上突然给泼了一盆凉水，但是当他听见法官说出下面一段话，他又安心了。法官“根据福克先生和他仆人的外籍身分”，决定要被告各缴巨额保证金一千英镑（合二万五千金法郎）。这样一来，福克先生要是不愿意服刑，就得缴两千英镑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison," said the judge. "Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But let them at least give me back my shoes!" cried Passepartout angrily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是至少他们得把鞋还给我啊！”路路通愤怒地喊着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The rascal is off, after all!" he exclaimed. "Two thousand pounds sacrificed! He's as prodigal as a thief! I'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个流氓，”费克斯喊着说，“他真的走了！两千英镑就这样扔了！真是象强盗一样挥金如土！哼！你就是跑到天边，我也得盯着你！可是，照他这样搞下去，偷来的钱很快就会给他全部花光了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr. Fogg's traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon landed on one of the quays.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="福克先生让艾娥达夫人挽着自己的手臂一同走出了法庭，后面跟着垂头丧气的路路通。费克斯还在死心眼地希望着这个大窃犯一定宁愿坐八天禁闭而决不肯丢掉这两千英镑呢，所以他就继续跟踪斐利亚·福克。福克先生叫来一辆马车，立即带着艾娥达夫人和路路通上车走了。费克斯跟在车后面跑，不一会儿，车子就停在加尔各答的一个码头上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o'clock was striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仰光号泊在离码头半海里的海湾里，大桅顶上已经升起了开船的信号旗。钟敲了十一点。福克先生早到了一小时。费克斯眼睁睁地看着福克带着艾娥达夫人和仆人下了车，上了一条小驳船，他气得在岸上直跺脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
