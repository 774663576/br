<div class="line_en">One day we were waiting outside one of the London parks when a dirty old cab drove up beside ours. The horse was brown, with bones that showed through her coat. I was eating some hay and the wind took a little of it her way. The poor animal put out her long thin neck and picked it up, then turned and looked for more. There was a hopeless look in her dull eye and I wondered where I'd seen her before. Then she looked straight at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天我们在伦敦的一个公园门外等客，一辆又脏又旧的车从我们身旁经过。那马是棕色的，瘦骨嶙峋。我正在吃草，风把几根草刮到她那边。可怜的家伙伸着她又瘦又长的脖子把草叼了起来，又转过头来找别的草吃。在她黯淡的眼睛中有一股绝望的神情，我寻思自己以前在哪儿见过它。她也定定地看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I moved closer to her so that we could have a quiet talk, and it was a sad story that she told me. After twelve months'rest at Earlshall she was considered to be ready to work again, and was sold to a gentleman. She got on well for a little while, but after a long gallop one day, she became ill again. She was rested, was seen by a horse doctor, then sold. In this way, she went from owner to owner several times, each one poorer than the one before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我凑近它，这样我们可以小声交谈。她给我讲了一个悲伤的故事。在沙尔伯爵庄园休养了一年后，主人认为她又能干活了，就把她卖给了一位先生。她开始还好，但是有一天经过长时间奔跑后，她又病了。她停止工作，看了医生，又被卖掉了。这样，她被从这个人卖到那个人，一个不如一个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So at last I was bought by a man who keeps a number of cabs and horses, and hires them out," said Ginger. "You look happy and comfortable with life as a cab horse, and I'm glad, but it's different for me. They whip me and work me seven days a week. They say that they paid more for me than I was worth, and now they're trying to get their money back by working me until I drop."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I did once," said Ginger. "But men are stronger than we are, and if they're cruel and have no feelings, then there's nothing we can do about it. Oh, I wish the end would come. I wish I was dead."</div>
