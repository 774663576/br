<div class="line_en">The woman withdrew her gaze from some distant mountain peak. Her small firm chin turned slowly. Her eyes were the blue of mountain lakes. Overhead the rain still pounded, with a remote sound, as if it was somebody else's rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女人收回了凝视着远处某座山峰的视线。她小巧、坚定的下巴慢慢转过来。她的眼睛是山间湖水的蓝色。头顶上方，雨声还是不断噼啪作响，却又略显遥远，仿佛这是场别人遭逢的大雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed there was a woman and she was sitting near a lamp, which was where she belonged, in a good light. Another light shone hard on my face, so I closed my eyes again and tried to look at her through the lashes. She was so platinumed that her hair shone like a silver fruit bowl. She wore a green knitted dress with a broad white collar turned over it. There was a sharp-angled glossy bag at her feet. She was smoking and a glass of amber fluid was tall and pale at her elbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我眼前好像有个女人，离她不远的地方是盏台灯，她就坐在明亮的灯光里。另一盏灯结结实实打在我脸上，我只好重新闭上眼睛，透过睫毛勉强看她。她被照成了白金色，连她的头发都闪亮得像只银果盆。她穿一件针织连衣裙，宽大的白衣领翻了下来。她的脚边放着一只尖边角、光滑材质的提包。她在抽烟，肘边搁着一大杯浅琥珀色饮料。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I moved my head a little, carefully. It hurt, but not more than I expected. I was trussed like a turkey ready for the oven. Handcuffs held my wrists behind me and a rope went from them to my ankles and then over the end of the brown davenport on which I was sprawled. The rope dropped out of sight over the davenport. I moved enough to make sure it was tied down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我小心地动了动脑袋。疼是疼，但并不比我预期的严重。我被绑得像只行将推入烤箱的火鸡。一副手铐反铐住我的手腕，一根绳子从我背后连出来捆住我的脚踝，一路延伸到我身下的长沙发尽头。随后绳子掉了下去，看不见了。我挪了挪身子，直到确定绳子扎紧了才不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一口简单的松木棺材就可以了。”我说，“把手是铜的是银的无所谓。也别把我的骨灰撒进湛蓝的太平洋。我更喜欢蚯蚓。你知道蚯蚓是雌雄同体，任何一条蚯蚓都能爱上另一条吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你感觉怎么样？”她的声音柔滑，如银铃般悦耳，跟她的头发一样美。那嗓音透着一丝清脆，就像玩偶小屋里铃铛的丁当声。这个念头一出现，我就觉得傻透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她把杯子拿了过来。酒里腾起泡沫，犹如虚幻的希望。她朝我俯下身来。她的气息柔和得好比小鹿的眼眸。我大口喝下酒。她从我嘴边拿开酒杯，看着几滴酒流下我的脖子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't like that. She glared at me. I grinned. "Unless you can unlock these bracelets, which I'd advise you not to do, you might spare me a little of that drink you're neglecting."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，原来你喜欢开赌场的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't move, didn't change position an inch. Her breath made a harsh quick sound. I looked around the room. Two doors, both in the same wall, one half open. A carpet of red and tan squares, blue curtains at the windows, a wallpaper with bright green pine trees on it. The furniture looked as if it had come from one of those places that advertise on bus benches. Gay, but full of resistance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没动，姿势没有丝毫变化。她的呼吸有点急促，带着刺耳的声响。我环顾了一下房间。有两扇门，在同一面墙上，一扇半开着。红棕相间的方格地毯，蓝色窗帘挂在窗前，墙纸上印着翠绿的松树图案。家具像是在巴士座椅上打广告的那种店里买来的。漂亮，却将人拒之千里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's just protective thinking. Once outside the law you're all the way outside. You think he's just a gambler. I think he's a pornographer, a blackmailer, a hot car broker, a killer by remote control, and a suborner of crooked cops. He's whatever looks good to him, whatever has the cabbage pinned to it. Don't try to sell me on any high-souled racketeers. They don't come in that pattern."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不过是保护性思维。犯了一次法，你就打算一条道走到黑了。你认为他只是开开赌场。我却认为他还是淫秽作品书商、诈骗犯、赃车掮客、远程控制杀人犯和收买警察的坏蛋。什么看上去对他有利，什么有钱可赚，他就干什么。别说什么灵魂高尚的黑帮老大之类，我不吃这一套。他们不可能是那样的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

This little bird picked up an idea about Canino. One way and another he and his friends found out where you were. He came to me to sell the information because he knew -- how he knew is a long story -- that I was working for General Sternwood. I got his information, but Canino got the little bird. He's a dead little bird now, with his feathers ruffled and his neck limp and a pearl of blood on his beak. Canino killed him. But Eddie Mars wouldn't do that, would he, Silver-Wig?

<div class="line_en">Her hand clutched in midair on the green lighter. The fingers strained. The knuckles were as white as snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的手悬在半空，紧抓着那只绿色的打火机。手指绷得很紧。关节苍白如雪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But Canino doesn't know I know that," I said. "About the little bird. All he knows is I'm nosing around."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但卡尼诺不知道我知道他同小矮子之间的事，”我说，“他只知道我在四处探查。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she laughed. It was almost a racking laugh. It shook her as the wind shakes a tree. I thought there was puzzlement in it, not exactly surprise, but as if a new idea had been added to something already known and it didn't fit. Then I thought that was too much to get out of a laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时她笑了。那简直是震天动地的笑。她笑得前俯后仰，仿佛一棵树遭到劲风吹拂。我听出那笑声里透着困惑，不尽是惊讶，但正如将一个全新的想法加进熟知的事物中，总有抵牾。随后我觉得我把一阵笑声想得太复杂了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I listened hard, my head throbbing. Just the rain still. "Let's go," I said. "Fast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我专注地听着，脑袋里咚咚作响。但其实只有雨在下个不停。“走吧，”我说，“快！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get out," she said harshly. "Get out of here quick."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“出去，”她厉声道，“赶紧出去！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's very funny," she said breathlessly. "Very funny, because, you see -- I still love him. Women --" She began to laugh again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常奇怪，”她上气不接下气地说，“非常奇怪，因为你知道——我还是爱着他。女人——”她又开始狂笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took two steps back and her face set hard. "Get out, you! Get out! You can walk to Realito. You can make it -- and you can keep your mouth shut -- for an hour or two at least. You owe me that much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她后退了两步，脸色严峻起来。“你给我出去！出去！你可以走去里阿利特。你能办到的——你可以闭上嘴巴——至少闭上一两个钟头。就算是报答我吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let's go," I said. "Got a gun, Silver-Wig?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走吧，”我说，“有枪吗，银发套姑娘？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我是不会走的。你知道的。求求你赶紧离开吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stepped up close to her, almost pressing against her. "You're going to stay here after turning me loose? Wait for that killer to come back so you can say so sorry? A man who kills like swatting a fly. Not much. You're going with me, Silver-Wig."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我迈步往前靠近她，几乎要压在她身上。“放了我，你还准备待在这儿不走？等那个杀人犯回来跟他说很抱歉？他杀起人来就像拍死只苍蝇。当然不行。你得跟我走，银发套姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get out!" she almost spit at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“出去！”她几乎朝我啐了一口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eddie's a handful of mush," I snarled. "Canino would take him with a teaspoon. He'll take him the way the cat took the canary. A handful of mush. The only time a girl like you goes for a wrong gee is when he's a handful of mush."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“艾迪是一碗玉米粥，”我咆哮道，“卡尼诺可以用个勺子一点点吃光他。他对付艾迪就像猫儿去抓一只金丝雀。一碗玉米粥罢了。像你这样的姑娘爱上谁都行，就是不该爱上一碗玉米粥啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not afraid of Canino. I'm still his boss's wife."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不怕卡尼诺。我总归是他的老板娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Suppose," I said thinly, "your handsome husband did kill Regan? Or suppose Canino did, without Eddie's knowing it. Just suppose. How long will you last, after turning me loose?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“假设，”我不太具有说服力地说，“你那帅气的丈夫真的杀了里根呢？或者假设是卡尼诺干的，而艾迪并不知情。就当是假设。放了我之后，你还能活多久？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okey." I turned away from her and moved out through the half-open door into a dark hallway. Then she rushed after me and pushed past to the front door and opened it. She peered out into the wet blackness and listened. She motioned me forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。”我转身背对着她，穿过那扇半开的门走进一条漆黑的过道。这时她追了上来，挤到我身前打开了大门。她朝门外下着雨的黑夜里仔细张望，听着动静。她挥手让我向前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's no hurry. All this was arranged in advance, rehearsed to the last detail, timed to the split second. Just like a radio program. No hurry at all. Kiss me, Silver-Wig."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用着急。这一切都经过预先的安排、细致的排练和精确的计算。就像一档电台节目。根本不用着急。吻我，银发套姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned against her and pressed her against the wall with my body. I pushed my mouth against her face. I talked to her that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我靠紧她，用身体把她压在墙壁上。我伸嘴贴住她的脸。我就这样对她说起话来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good-bye," she said under her breath. "Good luck in everything but one thing. Eddie didn't kill Rusty Regan. You'll find him alive and well somewhere, when he wants to be found."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再见。”她喘着气说，“希望一切都合你心意。除了一件事。艾迪没有杀拉斯蒂·里根。等他想露面的时候，你会在某个地方发现他活得好好的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her face under my mouth was like ice. She put her hands up and took hold of my head and kissed me hard on the lips. Her lips were like ice, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的脸被我的嘴巴贴着，冷若冰霜。她抬起手，抓住我的头，狠狠地亲了我的嘴唇。她的唇同样冷若冰霜。">查看中文翻译</div>
