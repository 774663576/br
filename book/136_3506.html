<div class="line_en">Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present only music was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the African front was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying about it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at terrifying speed. The mid-day bulletin had not mentioned any definite area, but it was probable that already the mouth of the Congo was a battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger. One did not have to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a question of losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the territory of Oceania itself was menaced.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavoured with cloves, the speciality of the cafe.</div>

<div class="line_en">A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking about the war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp. As always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly. The stuff was horrible. The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很强烈的情感，不完全是恐惧，而是一种同样的兴奋在他体内燃烧，接着又平息了。他不再想战争。这些天来，他不能在任何一个问题上长时间集中心思。他端起杯子，一口喝光。照例，这使他战栗，甚至有点反胃。这酒真可怕。丁香和糖精本身就足以令人恶心，更盖不住那浓浓的油味；最糟糕的是杜松子酒味日夜伴随着他，还与他心中那种东西的味道混杂在一起——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible he never visualized them. They were something that he was half-aware of, hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they released him, and had regained his old colour -- indeed, more than regained it. His features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of "The Times", with the page turned down at the chess problem. Then, seeing that Winston's glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no need to give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was always waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the place was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. He never even bothered to count his drinks. At irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him. It would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. He had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more highly-paid than his old job had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从不说出它们的名字，即使在思想中，也尽可能不去将它们具体化。它们是这样一种东西：朦胧地意识到，在他眼前晃荡，那味道黏在他的鼻子上。当杜松子酒在他体内发作，他紫色的嘴唇不停地打嗝。他们放他出来后，他就发胖了，也恢复了以往的气色——说实话，比原来还好。他的线条粗了起来，鼻子和面颊的皮肤发红，甚至光秃的头皮也是很深的粉红色。一个侍者又自觉地拿来棋盘和当天的《泰晤士报》，并翻到登着棋题的那一版。接着，看到温斯顿的酒杯空了，又拿来杜松子酒瓶给杯里倒酒。无需吩咐。他们知道他的习惯。棋盘总是给他准备好，角落的桌子也总是为他留着，即使屋子里人很多，他也有自己的位子，因为没有人愿意被看见跟他坐得太近。他甚至从不记住到底喝了几杯。隔一段时间，他们会给他一张很脏的纸条，他们说是账单，他印象中他们总是少要了他的钱。如果换种方式也没有什么不同。他现在总不缺钱花。他甚至有一份工作，一份闲差，比他以前的工作待遇更好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however. It was merely a brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding quarter, it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan's quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by 98 per cent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电幕上的音乐停了，有人在说话。温斯顿抬起头听着。但不是来自前线的公告。这仅仅是富裕部的一个简短通知。它说在前一个季度，第十个三年计划的鞋带份额超额完成了百分之九十八。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. "White to play and mate in two moves." Winston looked up at the portrait of Big Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always, without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always mates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看起棋题来，摆好了棋子。这是一盘棘手的残局，包括两只马。“白棋先走，两步将死。”温斯顿抬头看一眼老大哥的画像。白棋总是将死，他朦胧地觉得有一种神秘主义。总是这样，没有例外，就这么布局的。有史以来，棋题中没有黑棋赢的。难道棋题不是象征一种永恒不变的善良对邪恶的胜利吗？那张大脸也看着他，神情安详，充满力量。白棋总是将死对方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone: "You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty. Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance. Take care not to miss it. Fifteen-thirty!" The tinkling music struck up again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电幕上的声音停了片刻，接着又换了一种更严肃的语气说：“下午三点半有重要通知。下午三点半！这是最重要的消息。注意别错过。下午三点半！”丁丁当当的音乐又响了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston's heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his mind. He seemed actually to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly in his mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. THERE was the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their communications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence. But it was necessary to act quickly. If they could get control of the whole of Africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary medley of feeling -- but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was undermost -- struggled inside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿又激动起来。那是来自前线的公告；直觉告诉他，要宣布的是坏消息。一整天，他感到兴奋，心里不断冒出在非洲溃败的想法。他似乎真的看到了欧亚国军队冲过固若金汤的边界，像大群蚂蚁一样涌进非洲之角。为什么不能用某种方式包抄他们？他脑海中清晰地呈现出西非海岸的轮廓。他抓起白马，让它越过边界。那儿有个合适的地点。甚至当他看见黑色部落奔向南方时，他也看见另一支部队，神秘地集结，突然出现在他们的后方，切断他们陆上和海上的通道。他觉得凭借意志，他能够让另外一支部队成为现实。但这必须迅速行动。如果他们控制了整个非洲，如果他们在开普敦有了机场和潜艇基地，势将大洋国分割为二。这将意味着战败、崩溃、世界的重新划分、党的毁灭！他深深地吸了一口气。这真是一种非同寻常的感情混乱——确切地说，这不是一种混乱，而是感情的层层叠叠，说不出哪种感情处在最底层——它们彼此争战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was no danger in it. He knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another without a sign, then he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind. They halted. It was vilely cold. The wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional, dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他见到了她；他甚至跟她说了话。这没有什么危险了。他好像本能地知道，他们现在似乎对他的行为不感兴趣。他可以安排再次和她见面，如果他们都愿意的话。实际上，他们是偶然相遇的。这是三月的一个寒冷的日子，在公园里，土地冻得硬硬的，所有的草似乎都死了，哪儿都见不到一朵花蕾，除了一些番红花，被风吹得东倒西歪。他急匆匆赶路，手冻僵了，眼睛流出泪水，这时他看见她在离他不到十米远的地方。他马上想到，她有了某种说不出的变化。他们面对面经过时几乎没有什么表示，接着，他转身跟着她，但也不是非常迫切。他知道没有危险，没有人会对他们感兴趣。她没有说话。她斜穿草地走开了，好像要摆脱他，又似乎放任自己，随他走在自己的身边。这时他们走到了一丛光秃秃的灌木中，这个灌木丛既不能躲人，也无法躲避寒风。他们停下脚步。天气酷冷。寒风在树木丛中呼啸，摧残着偶尔开着、模样难看的番红花。他伸手搂着她的腰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. As they walked back across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time. It was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. They sat down on two iron chairs, side by side but not too close together. He saw that she was about to speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不想冒昧去吻她，他们也没有说话。他们走回那块草地，她才第一次正面看他。这只是片刻的凝视，充满了鄙视和厌恶。他想，这厌恶纯粹是因为过去的事，还是同时因为他那张浮肿的脸以及被风吹得不断流泪的眼睛。他们在两把铁椅上坐了下来，并排但并不靠得很近。他看出她想说话。她笨拙地动了动鞋，小心地折断一根小树枝。他注意到，她的脚好像变宽了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones: besides, they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They could have lain down on the ground and done THAT if they had wanted to. His flesh froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew now what had changed in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once, after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone than flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been.</div>

<div class="line_en">He followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her. They did not speak again. She did not actually try to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her. He had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable. He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from Julia as to get back to the Chestnut Tree Cafe, which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment. He had a nostalgic vision of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the ever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people. He made a half-hearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down, turned, and made off in the opposite direction. When he had gone fifty metres he looked back. The street was not crowded, but already he could not distinguish her. Any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers.

<div class="line_en">He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the element he swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin that sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning. When he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the Chestnut Tree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did a little work, or what was called work. He had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or outside. There were four others on the committee, all of them persons similar to himself. There were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. But there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished -- when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels -- threats, even, to appeal to higher authority. And then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一段回忆突然浮上心头。他看见一间点着蜡烛的房间，有一张铺着白色床单的大床，还有他自己，一个九岁或十岁的男孩，坐在地板上，摇晃着骰子盒，兴奋地笑着。他的母亲坐在他对面，也在笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It must have been about a month before she disappeared. It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He remembered the day well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mother said, "Now be good, and I'll buy you a toy. A lovely toy -- you'll love it"; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and Ladders. He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable outfit. The board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point. They played eight games, winning four each. His tiny sister, too young to understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster, laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这大概是她失踪前一个月的时候。这是一个和谐的时刻，他肚子里持续的饥饿被忘掉，幼时对她的爱暂时复活。他清楚地记得那一天是一个大雨滂沱湿漉漉的日子，雨水顺着窗户往下流，室内的光线太暗不能读书。黑暗中两个孩子很无聊，狭窄的卧室让人受不了。温斯顿不停地抱怨诉苦，徒劳地要吃要喝，烦躁不安，在房间里到处扔东西，踢护墙板，惹得邻居砰砰敲墙抗议，更小的那个孩子不停地哀号。最后，他的母亲说，“乖乖地别闹，我去给你买个玩具。一个好看的玩具——你会喜欢的。”说完，她冒雨出门，去一家小杂货店，小店就在附近，正好开着门，她回来时拿着一个纸盒，里面是一套蛇梯棋。他仍然记得潮纸盒的味道。这是一套可怜的玩具。棋盘有裂缝，木制小骰子做工粗糙，哪一面都很难放平。温斯顿闷闷不乐地看着这玩艺，不感兴趣。但他母亲点起一支蜡烛，他们坐在地板上玩蛇梯棋。他很快兴奋起来，大声笑着。当棋子有望爬上梯子时，却顺着蛇身滑下来，几乎回到起点。他们玩了八局，各赢了四局。他的小妹妹，太小，不会玩这个游戏，只是靠着长枕坐着，看他们笑她也笑。整个下午，他们在一起都很快乐，就像他小时候一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston raised his head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally eastward, across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist?</div>

<div class="line_en">He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false memory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally. They did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again. Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter. He had started as though a pin had run into him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had run round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black. Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: "Vast strategic manoeuvre -- perfect co-ordination -- utter rout -- half a million prisoners -- complete demoralization -- control of the whole of Africa -- bring the war within measurable distance of its end -- victory -- greatest victory in human history -- victory, victory, victory!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电幕上的声音仍在滔滔不绝地讲述俘虏、战利品和屠杀的事情，但外面的喊声低了一些。侍者们回到他们的工作中去。有个侍者拿着杜松子酒瓶走过来。温斯顿还沉浸在欣喜的梦境里，没注意到他的杯子已经加满了。他不再奔跑或欢呼。他回到了友爱部，一切得到了宽恕，他的灵魂洁白如雪。他站在被告席上，什么都招认，什么人都咬。他走在铺着白瓷砖的走廊上，感觉就像走在阳光下，一个武装警卫在他身后。期待很久的子弹正进入他的大脑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under the table Winston's feet made convulsive movements. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago -- yes, only ten minutes -- there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this moment.</div>
