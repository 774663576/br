<div class="line_en">"I was right," said Davies. "The channels are the key to the whole thing. We have no North Sea warships, no protection at all for our coastline. They'd land on one of the quiet, deserted sandy beaches on the east coast, far away from Chatham, our only eastern naval port."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说对了。”戴维斯说，“那些航道是整件事情的关键。英国在北海上没有军舰，海岸线毫无防护。他们将在东海岸某片寂静无人的沙滩登陆，远离东部唯一的军港——查塔姆。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”我定了定神，然后说道，“看来我们犯了个错误，我们这就走——别说话，戴维斯！——不过事先告诉你，我们什么都知道了。那天下午你们在梅默尔特岛说的话，我都记下来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," I interrupted, "we're short of time. At Memmert I heard your friends make an appointment behind your back, and I took the trouble to attend the meeting.

<div class="line_en">"Off the coast of Holland," I replied. I fell asleep soon afterwards, with the yacht rolling and the waves splashing all around me.

<div class="line_cn" title="“在荷兰沿海呢。”我回答。游艇在海面上摇曳，浪花四溅，我很快进入了梦乡。我没看到接下来发生的事情，因为当我听到戴维斯的喊声，爬上甲板时，一切已经结束了。下面是戴维斯的叙述：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies decided to take the route between the islands and the shore, and asked Clara to help him on deck. She was far more useful than I could have been, in my exhausted condition. When I went down to the cabin to fetch the Dutch chart, as we were getting close to the first of the Dutch islands, Dollmann sat up. He seemed in a dream. "Where are we?" he cried. There was a strange look in his eyes, which I didn't understand at the time, but remembered later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯决定走群岛和海岸之间的航线，并叫克拉拉去甲板上帮忙。在我筋疲力尽的状态下，她可比我管用多了。快到第一座荷属岛屿时，我下到船舱去拿荷兰海图。这时，多尔曼站起身来，像梦游一般。“到哪儿了？”他喊道。他的目光有几分奇怪，我当时没弄懂是什么意思，后来却清楚地记了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"X came up on deck soon after you went below. He offered to take the helm and show me a short cut, but I knew that one, so I didn't accept his offer. He said nothing, and sat behind us, safe enough, then, to my surprise, he began to talk very sensibly to me about the channel and the buoys and so on. Well, we came to a difficult bit, where I had to concentrate on the helm and the chart, and Clara was busy with the sails, and well -- I happened to look round, and he was gone. I think the last thing I heard him say was something about a 'short cut' again. He must have slipped over quietly. He had a thick coat and his heavy sea-boots on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你刚下去，X上校就来到甲板上。他提议由他掌舵，带我走一条近路，但我认识那条路，就没用他帮忙。他什么都没说，就安安稳稳地坐在我们身后。让我惊讶的是，他竟然有板有眼地跟我谈起航道、浮标什么的。唔，接下去的一段比较难走，我得集中精神掌舵，看海图，克拉拉忙着控制船帆，然后，唉—我碰巧回了一下头，他已经不见了。我想我听到他说的最后一句话还是关于什么‘近路’的。他一定是悄悄滑下船的，还穿着厚外套和重重的航海靴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
