<div class="line_en">"Now who's the best-looking person in the family, eh? I hope you enjoyed your week of being the pretty one, 'cause the queen is back, baby. You spent four hours at the salon to look like that. I just took a shower."</div>

<div class="line_en">Monday through Saturday my mom worked in her office and puttered around her garden dressed like a homeless person. Then Sunday morning for church she'd do her hair and put on a nice dress and some high heels and she looked like a million bucks. Once she was all done up, she couldn't resist teasing me, throwing little verbal jabs the way we'd always do with each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once I had my hair cornrowed for the matric dance, I started getting attention from girls for the first time. I actually went on dates. At times I thought that it was because I looked better. At other times I thought it was because girls liked the fact that I was going through as much pain as they did to look good. Either way, once I found success, I wasn't going to mess with the formula. I kept going back to the salon every week, spending hours at a time getting my hair straightened and cornrowed. My mom would just roll her eyes. "I could never date a man who spends more time on his hair than I do," she'd say.</div>

<div class="line_en">I can only assume that my mother broke more than a few hearts in her day, but from the time I was born, there were only two men in her life, my father and my stepfather. Right around the corner from my father's house in Yeoville, there was a garage called Mighty Mechanics. Our Volkswagen was always breaking down, and my mom would take it there to get it repaired. We met this really cool guy there, Abel, one of the auto mechanics. I'd see him when we went to fetch the car. The car broke down a lot, so we were there a lot. Eventually it felt like we were there even when there was nothing wrong with the vehicle. I was six, maybe seven. I didn't understand everything that was happening. I just knew that suddenly this guy was around. He was tall, lanky and lean but strong. He had these long arms and big hands. He could lift car engines and gearboxes. He was handsome, but he wasn't good-looking. My mom liked that about him; she used to say there's a type of ugly that women find attractive. She called him Abie. He called her Mbuyi, short for Nombuyiselo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想都不用想，那个周日，我妈妈肯定又俘获了好几个人的心，但是，打我出生开始算，我妈的人生中只经历过两个男人，我爸爸和我继父。在尤维尔，离我父亲的房子不远的街角处，有一家名为大力机修的汽车修理厂。我们家那台甲壳虫车总是出问题，我妈就会把车送去那边修理。我们在那儿遇见了一个很酷的男人，亚伯，他是那里的机师之一。我们去取车的时候会见到他。因为那辆车总是坏，所以我们总是能见到他。但后来，事情发展到了哪怕车没坏，我们也总去那儿见他。当时我才六、七岁，并不理解这是怎么回事。我只知道这个家伙总是突然在我们周围打转。他个子很高，身形瘦长，但人很强壮，胳膊长，手也大，可以徒手举起汽车发动机和变速箱。他很英俊，但是不算很好看。我妈妈就喜欢他这样的，她总是说，有一种男人虽然丑，但女人会觉得他很有魅力。她叫他亚比，他叫她努比，努拜伊赛罗的简称。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Abel was always cool with me. He wasn't trying to be my dad, and my dad was still in my life, so I wasn't looking for anyone to replace him. That's mom's cool friend is how I thought of him. He started coming out to stay with us in Eden Park. Some nights he'd want us to crash with him at his converted garage flat in Orange Grove, which we did. Then I burned down the white people's house, and that was the end of that. From then on we lived together in Eden Park.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚伯对我的态度也很酷。他没有想着要当我的父亲，我的亲生父亲依然健在，我并不需要什么人来代替他。我心里对亚伯的定位是我妈妈的酷朋友。有时候他会来伊登公园和我们住上几天，有时候会叫我们过去和他一起挤着住在橘子苑的狭小车库里，我们也去了。但后来我把那户白人的房子烧了，他住在那边的日子就结束了。之后，他和我们一起住在了伊登公园。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I liked him, too. Abie was charming and hilarious and had an easy, gracious smile. He loved helping people, too, especially anyone in distress. If someone's car broke down on the freeway, he pulled over to see what he could do. If someone yelled "Stop, thief!" he was the guy who gave chase. The old lady next door needed help moving boxes? He's that guy. He liked to be liked by the world, which made his abuse even harder to deal with. Because if you think someone is a monster and the whole world says he's a saint, you begin to think that you're the bad person. It must be my fault this is happening is the only conclusion you can draw, because why are you the only one receiving his wrath?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我那时也喜欢他。亚伯很迷人，爱开玩笑，脸上总是带着亲切又温柔的笑容。他很喜欢帮助别人，尤其是弱势群体。如果有人的车子在高速路上抛锚了，他就会停下车，去看看有什么能帮上忙的。如果有人喊道：“抓贼啊！”他也会是那个奋不顾身冲上去的人。隔壁的老奶奶需要帮忙搬几个箱子？他会大步上前。他喜欢被其他人喜欢的感觉，所以这也让我们后来更难面对他的家暴行为。因为如果你觉得某个人是野兽，但整个世界都说他是圣人，你会开始认为自己才是那个有问题的坏人。你只能做出这样的结论：肯定是因为我的错，才会发生这一切，否则为什么他只在你身上泄愤呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

I only vaguely remember my mom being gone for a few days, and when she got back there was now this thing in the house that cried and shat and got fed, but when you're nine years older than your sibling, their arrival doesn't change much for you. I wasn't changing diapers; I was out playing arcade games at the shop, running around the neighborhood.</div>

<div class="line_en">If there was any doubt about Abel, the truth was right there in front of us all along, in his name. He was Abel, the good brother, the good son, a name straight out of the Bible.

<div class="line_cn" title="如果亚伯身上有任何值得怀疑的地方，那么真相就藏在他的名字里，时时刻刻伴随着我们。他是亚伯，这名字来自于《圣经》的名字，意味着一位好兄长和好儿子。他也确实做到了。他是家里的长子，很负责任，孝顺母亲，照顾弟兄，是他们一家的骄傲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The main thing that marked Andrew's birth for me was our first trip to meet Abel's family during the Christmas holidays. They lived in Tzaneen, a town in Gazankulu, what had been the Tsonga homeland under apartheid. Tzaneen has a tropical climate, hot and humid. The white farms nearby grow some of the most amazing fruit -- mangoes, lychees, the most beautiful bananas you've ever seen in your life. That's where all the fruit we export to Europe comes from. But on the black land twenty minutes down the road, the soil has been decimated by years of overfarming and overgrazing. Abel's mother and his sisters were all traditional, stay-at-home moms, and Abel and his younger brother, who was a policeman, supported the family. They were all very kind and generous and accepted us as part of the family right away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安德鲁出生后，我印象最深的一件事是我们在圣诞节的时候去拜访亚伯的家人。他们住在察嫩，位于加赞库卢的一个小镇，是种族隔离制度下的聪加黑人家园。察嫩是热带气候，炎热潮湿。那里附近的白人农场都在种植超级棒的水果——芒果、荔枝，还有你从没见过的最好看的香蕉。这里生长的水果都会出口到欧洲。但是沿着路再开20分钟的车，就到了黑人的土地上，这片土地已经因为多年的过度开垦和过度放牧，变得贫瘠不堪。亚伯的母亲和他的姐妹都是传统的家庭妇女，亚伯和他做警察的弟弟出去赚钱养家。他们是非常热情慷慨的人，立刻就把我们接纳为了家庭的一员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tsonga culture, I learned, is extremely patriarchal. We're talking about a world where women must bow when they greet a man. Men and women have limited social interactions. The men kill the animals, and the women cook the food. Men are not even allowed in the kitchen. As a nine-year-old boy, I thought this was fantastic. I wasn't allowed to do anything. At home my mom was forever making me do chores -- wash the dishes, sweep the house -- but when she tried to do that in Tzaneen, the women wouldn't allow it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我了解到，聪加文化非常重男轻女。在他们的世界里，女人见到男人时必须要鞠躬。男人和女人在社会上的互动极其有限。男人屠宰牲畜，女人做饭。男人甚至不能出现在厨房里。作为一个九岁的男孩，我觉得这简直太棒了。他们不让我干任何家务活。在家里，我妈永远都在给我指派活儿——洗碗，打扫屋子——但是她在察嫩指派我干活儿的时候，其他女人都不允许她这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother loathed every moment of being there. For Abel, a firstborn son who was bringing home his own firstborn son, this trip was a huge deal. In the homelands, the firstborn son almost becomes the father/husband by default because the dad is off working in the city. The firstborn son is the man of the house. He raises his siblings. His mom treats him with a certain level of respect as the dad's surrogate. Since this was Abel's big homecoming with Andrew, he expected my mother to play her traditional role, too. But she refused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我妈妈厌恶在那边度过的每一分钟。对于亚伯来说，作为家里的长子，他带回了他自己的长子，这是一次具有重大意义的归家之旅。在黑人家园里，长子通常会承担类似于父亲以及丈夫的角色，因为父亲通常都会远在城里工作。长子就变成了家里的顶梁柱。他要照顾弟弟妹妹。他的母亲会给予他一定程度上的尊敬，因为他就是父亲的替身。这也是亚伯大费周章带安德鲁回家的原因，他希望我母亲也能扮演好她的传统身份。但是她拒绝了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The women in Tzaneen had a multitude of jobs during the day. They prepared breakfast, prepared tea, prepared lunch, did the washing and the cleaning. The men had been working all year in the city to support the family, so this was their vacation, more or less. They were at leisure, waited on by the women. They might slaughter a goat or something, do whatever manly tasks needed to be done, but then they would go to an area that was only for men and hang out and drink while the women cooked and cleaned. But my mom had been working in the city all year, too, and Patricia Noah didn't stay in anyone's kitchen. She was a free-roaming spirit. She insisted on walking to the village, going where the men hung out, talking to the men as equals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="察嫩的妇女从早到晚要干很多活儿，要做早餐、煮茶、准备午饭、洗碗、洗衣服、打扫屋子。男人们整年都在城市里赚钱养家，所以回家这件事对他们来说差不多就像度假。他们从容又休闲，享受着女人的服侍。他们可能会杀一只羊什么的，把属于男人的活儿干了，然后就去那些只有男人能进的地方喝酒玩乐，而女人则继续留在家里煮饭打扫。可是我母亲已经在城里工作一整年了，而且帕特莉莎·诺亚才不会在厨房里打转。她是一个自由浪荡的灵魂。她坚持要到村子里去，到那些男人们喝酒的地方，平等地和他们聊天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The whole tradition of women bowing to the men, my mom found that absurd. But she didn't refuse to do it. She overdid it. She made a mockery of it. The other women would bow before men with this polite little curtsy. My mom would go down and cower, groveling in the dirt like she was worshipping a deity, and she'd stay down there for a long time, like a really long time, long enough to make everyone very uncomfortable. That was my mom. Don't fight the system. Mock the system. To Abel, it looked like his wife didn't respect him. Every other man had some docile girl from the village, and here he'd come with this modern woman, a Xhosa woman no less, a culture whose women were thought of as particularly loudmouthed and promiscuous. The two of them fought and bickered the whole time, and after that first trip my mother refused to go back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于女人要向男人鞠躬的传统，我妈更是觉得荒谬至极，不过她也不完全拒绝，而是把这个动作做得很过火，以达到嘲讽的目的。其他女人会在男人面前很有礼貌地微微屈膝行礼，而我妈则会直接趴倒，蜷起身子，匍匐在地，好像在拜神一样，而且她会在地上一直趴着，趴很久很久，久到让所有人开始感到不适。那就是我妈妈。她不对抗体制，她嘲讽体制。对亚伯来说，这看上去就是妻子不尊重他的表现。所有其他男人娶的都是本地村里的温顺姑娘，他却带回了一位现代女性，而且还是一个科萨女人，科萨女人给人的刻板印象就是她们喜欢吵吵嚷嚷，而且生活作风淫乱。在这趟归乡之旅中，他们俩全程都在吵架、打架，从那次以后，我妈再也不愿意去察嫩了。">查看中文翻译</div>

One thing that became clear early on was that those ideas did not include me. I was a reminder that my mom had lived a life before him. I didn't even share his color. His family was him, my mom, and the new baby. My family was my mom and me. I actually appreciated that about him. Sometimes he was my buddy, sometimes not, but he never pretended our relationship was anything other than what it was. We'd joke around and laugh together. We'd watch TV together. He'd slip me pocket money now and again after my mother said I'd had enough. But he never gave me a birthday present or a Christmas present. He never gave me the affection of a father.

I could feel that he was trying to rein in our independence. He even got upset about church. "You cannot be at church the whole day," he'd say. "My wife is gone all day, and what will people say?

The way my mother always explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He's attracted to independent women.

<div class="line_en">When we first met Abel, he smoked a lot of weed. He drank, too, but it was mostly weed. Looking back, I almost miss his pothead days because the weed mellowed him out. He'd smoke, chill, watch TV, and fall asleep. I think subconsciously it was something he knew he needed to do to take the edge off his anger. He stopped smoking after he and my mom got married. She made him stop for religious reasons -- the body is a temple and so on. But what none of us saw coming was that when he stopped smoking weed he just replaced it with alcohol. He started drinking more and more. He never came home from work sober. An average day was a six-pack of beer after work. Weeknights he'd have a buzz on. Some Fridays and Saturdays he just didn't come home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们刚认识亚伯的时候，他经常抽大麻。他也喝酒，但主要是抽大麻。回头想想，我几乎有点儿怀念那时候的他，因为大麻会让他的性情平和下来，抽抽大麻，放松身心，看着电视，就睡着了。我潜意识里觉得，他应该是明白他需要大麻来抑制自己的暴脾气。他和我妈结婚后不久，就不再抽大麻了。我妈用某些宗教原因劝阻了他——比如你的身体是一座神殿之类的话。但是我们都没想到的是，他不抽大麻以后，又开始酗酒了，喝得越来越多，几乎没有哪天下班回家是清醒的。平常下班后，他还要喝一提啤酒，就是六瓶。工作日里他只求微醺，周五周六晚上，他干脆都不回家了。">查看中文翻译</div>

They were the eyes of the Devil.</div>

The pot had burned itself out and burned up the kitchen wall behind the stove, and smoke was billowing everywhere. She turned off the stove and opened the doors and the windows to try to air the place out. Then she went over to the couch and woke him up and started berating him for nearly burning the house down.

<div class="line_en">The garage gradually took over our lives. I'd get out of school and walk the five kilometers from Maryvale to the workshop. I'd sit for hours and try to do my homework with the machines and repairs going on around me. Inevitably Abel would get behind schedule on a car, and since he was our ride, we'd have to wait for him to finish before we could go home. It started out as "We're running late. Go nap in a car, and we'll tell you when we're leaving." I'd crawl in the backseat of some sedan, they'd wake me up at midnight, and we'd drive all the way back out to Eden Park and crash. Then pretty soon it was "We're running late. Go sleep in a car, and we'll wake you for school in the morning." We started sleeping at the garage. At first it was one or two nights a week, then three or four. Then my mom sold the house and put that money into the business as well. She went all in. She gave up everything for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个汽车修理厂，彻底占据了我们的生活。每天放学后，我要从玛丽威尔步行五公里走到厂子里去。在那待上几个小时，在机器的轰鸣声中努力写作业。不可避免地，亚伯的修车进度往往会拖延，但因为他要开车送我们回家，我们就只能等着他干完活，才能一起回家。开始的时候是：“我们会晚点儿结束。找个车里睡一觉，走的时候叫你。”我就爬进某个轿车的后座睡下，他们会在午夜把我叫醒，我们再开车回伊登公园睡觉。不久之后就变成了：“我们要晚点儿结束。找个车去睡觉，明早上学会叫你起床的。”我们开始在修车厂过夜。最初的时候，一周会在那儿过两个晚上，然后变成三晚、四晚。再后来，我妈卖了我们的房子，把钱全投进了修车厂。她付出了全部，用尽自己的所有来支持他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From that point on we lived in the garage. It was a warehouse, basically, and not the fancy, romantic sort of warehouse hipsters might one day turn into lofts. No, no. It was a cold, empty space. Gray concrete floors stained with oil and grease, old junk cars and car parts everywhere. Near the front, next to the roller door that opened onto the street, there was a tiny office built out of drywall for doing paperwork and such. In the back was a kitchenette, just a sink, a portable hot plate, and some cabinets. To bathe, there was only an open wash basin, like a janitor's sink, with a showerhead rigged up above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那时起，我们就住在修车厂里了。那里就是个大仓库，但并不是那种将来可以改建成时髦住宅的浪漫空间。不是，不是。那里就是一个空旷、寒冷的大屋子。灰色的水泥地上沾满了油污，报废汽车和车零件到处都是。在工厂前部，靠近临街卷门的地方，有一间用石膏板隔出来的小办公室，用来处理文件工作。后部有个小厨房，基本就是一个水池，一个轻便电炉，几个柜子。要洗澡的话，户外有个洗脸盆，很像清洁工用的那种水槽，上面挂了个莲蓬头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since Mighty Mechanics was now a family business, and I was family, I also had to work. There was no more time for play. There wasn't even time for homework. I'd walk home, the school uniform would come off, the overalls would go on, and I'd get under the hood of some sedan. I got to a point where I could do a basic service on a car by myself, and often I did. Abel would say, "That Honda. Minor service." And I'd get under the hood. Day in and day out. Points, plugs, condensers, oil filters, air filters. Install new seats, change tires, swap headlights, fix taillights. Go to the parts shop, buy the parts, back to the workshop. Eleven years old, and that was my life. I was falling behind in school. I wasn't getting anything done. My teachers used to come down on me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大力机修是我们家的生意，而我也是家庭成员，所以我也得干活。我失去了玩的时间，甚至连写作业的时间都没了。每天我从学校走路回家后，就得脱掉校服，穿上工装，钻到某辆轿车的底盘下面。到后来，我已经会给车做一些简易的维修保养了，而且也常常得做，亚伯会说：“那辆本田，简单保养。”然后，我就会走去打开引擎罩子。日复一日。电子开关、栓塞、冷凝器、滤油器、散热器、安装新座椅、换轮胎、换车前灯、修尾灯、去汽配店、买配件、回机修厂。那年我11岁，那就是我的人生。我的功课落下了不少，我什么作业都完不成。我的老师常常教训我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Abel and my mom slept with Andrew in the office on a thin mattress they'd roll out on the floor. I slept in the cars. I got really good at sleeping in cars. I know all the best cars to sleep in. The worst were the cheap ones, Volkswagens, low-end Japanese sedans. The seats barely reclined, no headrests, cheap fake-leather upholstery. I'd spend half the night trying not to slide off the seat. I'd wake up with sore knees because I couldn't stretch out and extend my legs. German cars were wonderful, especially Mercedes. Big, plush leather seats, like couches. They were cold when you first climbed in, but they were well insulated and warmed up nicely. All I needed was my school blazer to curl up under, and I could get really cozy inside a Mercedes. But the best, hands-down, were American cars. I used to pray for a customer to come in with a big Buick with bench seats. If I saw one of those, I'd be like, Yes! It was rare for American cars to come in, but when they did, boy, was I in heaven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚伯、我妈和安德鲁都睡在办公室，他们在地上铺了一块薄薄的床垫。我睡在车里。我其实还挺喜欢在车里睡。我知道什么车睡得最舒服。便宜车睡得最不舒服，比如大众，还有那些低端日本轿车。那些座位几乎都没有弹性，没有靠垫，用的都是廉价的人造革。如果睡在这类车里，我晚上有一半的时间都在努力不让自己从座位上滑下去。早上起来膝盖酸痛，因为一整夜我的腿都伸不直。德国车很适合睡，尤其是奔驰。空间大，豪华真皮座椅，跟沙发似的。你刚睡进去的时候会觉得冷，但是它们保温性好，一会儿就能暖和起来，我只需要把校服卷起来枕着，就能在奔驰车里睡得很舒服。但是毫无疑问，最好的还是美国车。我曾经默默祈祷，希望能出现一位顾客带进来一辆带有高靠背座椅的别克车。如果我看到这样的车，就会高兴得不行，太棒了！来送修的美国车很少，但要有的话，老天啊，我简直像上了天堂一样幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We worked and worked and worked, but no matter how many hours we put in, the business kept losing money. We lost everything. We couldn't even afford real food. There was one month I'll never forget, the worst month of my life. We were so broke that for weeks we ate nothing but bowls of marogo, a kind of wild spinach, cooked with caterpillars. Mopane worms, they're called. Mopane worms are literally the cheapest thing that only the poorest of poor people eat. I grew up poor, but there's poor and then there's "Wait, I'm eating worms." Mopane worms are the sort of thing where even people in Soweto would be like, "Eh… no." They're these spiny, brightly colored caterpillars the size of your finger. They're nothing like escargot, where someone took a snail and gave it a fancy name. They're fucking worms. They have black spines that prick the roof of your mouth as you're eating them. When you bite into a mopane worm, it's not uncommon for its yellow-green excrement to squirt into your mouth.</div>

I snapped and ran to my mom crying. "I don't want to eat caterpillars anymore!" That night she scraped some money together and bought us chicken.

<div class="line_en">I didn't hate my mom, or even Abel, funnily enough. Because I saw how hard everyone was working. At first I didn't know about the mistakes being made on the business level that were making it hard, so it just felt like a hard situation. But eventually I started to see why the business was hemorrhaging money. I used to go around and buy auto parts for Abel, and I learned that he was buying his parts on credit. The vendors were charging him a crazy markup. The debt was crippling the company, and instead of paying off the debt he was drinking what little cash he made. Brilliant mechanic, horrible businessman.</div>

She brought her office skills to the garage full-time and started keeping the books, making the schedule, balancing the accounts. And it was going well, until Abel started to feel like she was running his business. People started commenting on it as well. Clients were getting their cars on time, vendors were getting paid on time, and they would say, "Hey, Abie, this workshop is going so much better now that your wife has taken over." That didn't help.</div>

<div class="line_en">We lived in the workshop for close to a year, and then my mom had had enough. She was willing to help him, but not if he was going to drink all the profits. She had always been independent, self-sufficient, but she'd lost that part of herself at the mercy of someone else's failed dream. At a certain point she said, "I can't do this anymore. I'm out of this. I'm done." She went out and got a job as a secretary with a real-estate developer, and somehow, between that and borrowing against whatever equity was left in Abel's workshop, she was able to get us the house in Highlands North. We moved, the workshop was seized by Abel's creditors, and that was the end of that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Growing up I suffered no shortage of my mother's old school, Old Testament discipline. She spared no rod and spoiled no child. With Andrew, she was different. He got spankings at first, but they tapered off and eventually went away. When I asked her why I got beatings and Andrew didn't, she made a joke about it like she does with everything. "I beat you like that because you could take it," she said. "I can't hit your little brother the same way because he's a skinny little stick. He'll break. But you, God gave you that ass for whipping." Even though she was kidding, I could tell that the reason she didn't beat Andrew was because she'd had a genuine change of heart on the matter.

We'd moved to Highlands North, and I'd gotten in trouble at school for forging my mom's signature on some document; there was some activity I didn't want to participate in, so I'd signed the release in her name to get out of it. The school called my mom, and she asked me about it when I got home that afternoon. I was certain she was going to punish me, but this turned out to be one of those times when she didn't care. She said I should have just asked her; she would have signed the form anyway.

I ran out of the house and jumped over the gate, and I ran and I ran and I ran. The last time I turned around he was rounding the gate, coming out of the yard after me.

<div class="line_en">You don't have to teach me a lesson twice. From that day until the day I left home, I lived like a mouse in that house. If Abel was in a room, I was out of the room. If he was in one corner, I was in the other corner. If he walked into a room, I would get up and act like I was going to the kitchen, then when I reentered the room, I would make sure I was close to the exit. He could be in the happiest, friendliest mood. Didn't matter. Never again did I let him come between me and a door. Maybe a couple of times after that I was sloppy and he'd land a punch or a kick before I could get away, but I never trusted him again, not for a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一件事你不用教我两遍。从那天起，直到我离开家以前，我都活得像一只老鼠。如果亚伯在房间里，我就在房间外面。如果他在这个角落，我就在另一个角落。如果他走进我身处的房间，我就立刻起身，假装要去厨房，然后再折回来，确保自己在离出口最近的屋子。哪怕他心情超好，看起来特别开心，我也一样，我决不会让他再挡在我和门之间。可能后来还有几次，以为我放松了警惕，他在我跑掉之前打了我一拳，或踢了我一脚，但我再也没相信过他，一秒钟都没信过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The moment I saw him I put my head down and ran. I ran like the Devil was chasing me. Abel was bigger and faster, but this was my neighborhood. You couldn't catch me in my neighborhood. I knew every alley and every street, every wall to climb over, every fence to slip through. I was ducking through traffic, cutting through yards. I have no idea when he gave up because I never looked back. I ran and ran and ran, as far as my legs would carry me. I was in Bramley, three neighborhoods away, before I stopped. I found a hiding place in some bushes and crawled inside and huddled there for what felt like hours.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was different for Andrew. Andrew was Abel's son, flesh of his flesh, blood of his blood. Despite being nine years younger than me, Andrew was really the eldest son in that house, Abel's firstborn, and that accorded him a respect that I and even my mother never enjoyed. And Andrew had nothing but love for that man, despite his shortcomings. Because of that love, I think, out of all of us, Andrew was the only one who wasn't afraid. He was the lion tamer, only he'd been raised by the lion -- he couldn't love the beast any less despite knowing what it was capable of. For me, the first glint of anger or madness from Abel and I was gone. Andrew would stay and try to talk Abel down. He'd even get between Abel and Mom. I remember one night when Abel threw a bottle of Jack Daniel's at Andrew's head. It just missed him and exploded on the wall. Which is to say that Andrew stayed long enough to get the bottle thrown at him. I wouldn't have stuck around long enough for Abel to get a bead on me.</div>

Once Abel's debts and his terrible business decisions started impacting my mother's credit and her ability to support her sons, she wanted out. "I don't have debts," she said. "I don't have bad credit. I'm not doing these things with you." We were still a family and they were still traditionally married, but she divorced him in order to separate their financial affairs.

At the same time, my mother started moving up at the real-estate company she worked for, taking on more responsibilities and earning a better salary. His workshop became like a side hobby almost. He was supposed to pay for Andrew's school fees and groceries, but he started falling behind even on that, and soon my mom was paying for everything. She paid the electricity. She paid the mortgage.

<div class="line_en">There was an undercurrent of terror that ran through the house, but the actual beatings themselves were not that frequent. I think if they had been, the situation would have ended sooner. Ironically, the good times in between were what allowed it to drag out and escalate as far as it did. He hit my mom once, then the next time was three years later, and it was just a little bit worse. Then it was two years later, and it was just a little bit worse. Then it was a year later, and it was just a little bit worse. It was sporadic enough to where you'd think it wouldn't happen again, but it was frequent enough that you never forgot it was possible. There was a rhythm to it. I remember one time, after one terrible incident, nobody spoke to him for over a month. No words, no eye contact, no conversations, nothing. We moved through the house as strangers, at different times. Complete silent treatment. Then one morning you're in the kitchen and there's a nod. "Hey." "Hey." Then a week later it's "Did you see the thing on the news?" "Yeah." Then the next week there's a joke and a laugh. Slowly, slowly, life goes back to how it was.

I cried so hard that if my present crying self could go back in time and see my other crying selves, it would slap them and say, "That shit's not worth crying for." My cry was not a cry of sadness. It was not catharsis. It wasn't me feeling sorry for myself. It was an expression of raw pain that came from an inability of my body to express that pain in any other way, shape, or form.

It missed the spinal cord by a hair, missed the medulla oblongata, and traveled through her head just underneath the brain, missing every major vein, artery, and nerve. With the trajectory the bullet was on, it was headed straight for her left eye socket and would have blown out her eye, but at the last second it slowed down, hit her cheekbone instead, shattered her cheekbone, ricocheted off, and came out through her left nostril. On the gurney in the emergency room, the blood had made the wound look much worse than it was. The bullet took off only a tiny flap of skin on the side of her nostril, and it came out clean, with no bullet fragments left inside. She didn't even need surgery.

<div class="line_en">The doctors kept her sedated the rest of that day and night to rest. They told all of us to go home. "She's stable," they said. "There's nothing you can do here. Go home and sleep." So we did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天医生给她注射了镇静剂，让她晚上就在医院好好休息，然后告诉让我们回家去等着。“她的情况稳定了，”他们说，“你们在这儿也没什么事。回家睡觉吧。”于是我们就回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sat close by her bed, holding her hand, waiting and watching her breathe, a flood of thoughts going through my mind. I was still afraid I was going to lose her. I was angry at myself for not being there, angry at the police for all the times they didn't arrest Abel. I told myself I should have killed him years ago, which was ridiculous to think because I'm not capable of killing anyone, but I thought it anyway. I was angry at the world, angry at God. Because all my mom does is pray. If there's a fan club for Jesus, my mom is definitely in the top 100, and this is what she gets?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在她的床边坐下来，握住她的手，等待着，看着她的呼吸一起一伏，脑中汹涌地翻滚着无数的念头。我依然害怕我会失去她。我生我自己的气，因为我当时不在场，我生那些警察的气，因为他们以前有那么多次都没把亚伯逮捕。我对我自己说，几年前我就该杀了他。这想法很荒谬，因为我没能力杀死任何人，但我还是忍不住这么想。我生这个世界的气，生上帝的气。因为我妈妈无时无刻不在祈祷。如果耶稣的粉丝俱乐部有排名的话，我妈绝对能排在前一百，可这就是她得到的回赠？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After an hour or so of waiting, she opened her unbandaged eye. The second she did, I lost it. I started bawling.
