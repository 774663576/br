<div class="line_en">A few months earlier, when crisp leaves had begun slipping to the ground, signaling the end of summer, Dad had been in high spirits. His feet tapped show tunes at breakfast, and during dinner he often pointed at the mountain, his eyes shining, and described where he would lay the pipes to bring water down to the house. Dad promised that when the first snow fell, he'd build the biggest snowball in the state of Idaho. What he'd do, he said, was hike to the mountain base and gather a small, insignificant ball of snow, then roll it down the hillside, watching it triple in size each time it raced over a hillock or down a ravine. By the time it reached the house, which was atop the last hill before the valley, it'd be big as Grandpa's barn and people on the highway would stare up at it, amazed. We just needed the right snow. Thick, sticky flakes. After every snowfall, we brought handfuls to him and watched him rub the flakes between his fingers. That snow was too fine. This, too wet. After Christmas, he said. That's when you get the real snow.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one saw the car leave the road. My brother Tyler, who was seventeen, fell asleep at the wheel. It was six in the morning and he'd been driving in silence for most of the night, piloting our station wagon through Arizona, Nevada and Utah. We were in Cornish, a farming town twenty miles south of Buck's Peak, when the station wagon drifted over the center line into the other lane, then left the highway. The car jumped a ditch, smashed through two utility poles of thick cedar, and was finally brought to a stop only when it collided with a row-crop tractor.</div>

<div class="line_en">By January Dad couldn't get out of bed. He lay flat on his back, staring blankly at the stucco ceiling with its intricate pattern of ridges and veins. He didn't blink when I brought his dinner plate each night. I'm not sure he knew I was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了一月，爸爸就下不了床了。他平躺在床上，两眼空洞地盯着灰泥天花板上错综复杂的起伏和纹理构成的图案。每天晚上我端饭给他，他连眼都不眨一下。我不确定他是否知道我进过他房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We arrived a few hours after sunrise. Dad made it as far as Grandma's porch, where he stayed for the rest of the day, a knitted pillow under his head, a callused hand on his stomach. He kept that posture for two days, eyes open, not saying a word, still as a bush in that dry, windless heat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们于日出几小时后到达。爸爸最远也就挪到奶奶家的门廊，在那里待了一整天。他头下枕一个针织枕头，一只长满老茧的手放在肚子上。他一连两天保持着这个姿势，睁着眼睛，一句话也不说，宛如那干燥无风的炎热沙漠中的一株灌木般静止不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But after Christmas Dad seemed to deflate, to collapse in on himself. He stopped talking about the snowball, then he stopped talking altogether. A darkness gathered in his eyes until it filled them. He walked with his arms limp, shoulders slumping, as if something had hold of him and was dragging him to the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但圣诞节过后，爸爸似乎像泄了气的皮球，整个人垮了。他不再谈什么雪球，然后连话也懒得说了。他的眼神越来越黯淡，最后完全失去了光彩。他走起路来耷拉着肩膀，胳膊软弱无力，好像有什么东西抓住了他，把他往地面拖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's when Mother announced we were going to Arizona. She said Dad was like a sunflower -- he'd die in the snow -- and that come February he needed to be taken away and planted in the sun. So we piled into the station wagon and drove for twelve hours, winding through canyons and speeding over dark freeways, until we arrived at the mobile home in the parched Arizona desert where my grandparents were waiting out the winter.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the third day he seemed to come back into himself, to become aware of the goings-on around him, to listen to our mealtime chatter rather than staring, unresponsive, at the carpet. After dinner that night, Grandma played her phone messages, which were mostly neighbors and friends saying hello. Then a woman's voice came through the speaker to remind Grandma of her doctor's appointment the following day. That message had a dramatic effect on Dad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三天他似乎有所恢复，开始注意周围发生的事，听我们吃饭时的闲聊，而不再只是盯着地毯，毫无反应。那天晚饭后奶奶播放电话留言，大部分是邻居和朋友的问候。接着，话筒里传来一个女人的声音，提醒奶奶不要忘了第二天和医生的预约。这则留言对爸爸产生了戏剧性的影响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first Dad asked Grandma questions: what was the appointment for, who was it with, why would she see a doctor when Mother could give her tinctures.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad had always believed passionately in Mother's herbs, but that night felt different, like something inside him was shifting, a new creed taking hold. Herbalism, he said, was a spiritual doctrine that separated the wheat from the tares, the faithful from the faithless. Then he used a word I'd never heard before: Illuminati. It sounded exotic, powerful, whatever it was. Grandma, he said, was an unknowing agent of the Illuminati.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸一直热切信任母亲的草药，但那晚感觉不一样了，就像他内心的什么东西在改变，一则新的信条生根发芽。他说，药草学是一种精神教义，它能区分麦子和稗子，区分忠实信徒和背信弃义之人。然后他用了一个我从未听过的词：光明会[5]。不管是什么意思，这个词听上去奇特，有力。他说，奶奶无意中充当了光明会的代理人。【注：[5]Illuminati，又称“光照派”，意欲合谋控制世界的秘密组织，是虔诚的摩门教徒排斥的对象。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother was staring at her food. At the word "whore" she stood, threw Dad an angry look, then walked into her room and slammed the door. Mother didn't always agree with Dad. When Dad wasn't around, I'd heard her say things that he -- or at least this new incarnation of him -- would have called sacrilege, things like, "Herbs are supplements. For something serious, you should go to a doctor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲正盯着食物，一听到“婊子”这个词，她霍地站起身来，生气地瞪了爸爸一眼，走进她房间，砰的一声关上门。对于爸爸的观点，母亲并不总是赞同。爸爸不在的时候，我听见她说一些他——至少是他的新化身——认为是亵渎上帝的话，比如，“草药只是补充，病情严重了还是要去看医生”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Doctors and pills," Dad said, nearly shouting. "That's their god, and they whore after it."</div>

<div class="line_en">God couldn't abide faithlessness, Dad said. That's why the most hateful sinners were those who wouldn't make up their minds, who used herbs and medication both, who came to Mother on Wednesday and saw their doctor on Friday -- or, as Dad put it, "Who worship at the altar of God one day and offer a sacrifice to Satan the next." These people were like the ancient Israelites because they'd been given a true religion but hankered after false idols.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I think of that dinner, the scene comes back to me clearly. I'm sitting at the table. Dad is talking, his voice urgent. Grandma sits across from me, chewing her asparagus again and again in her crooked jaw, the way a goat might, sipping from her ice water, giving no indication that she's heard a word Dad has said, except for the occasional vexed glare she throws the clock when it tells her it's still too early for bed. "You're a knowing participant in the plans of Satan," Dad says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回想起那顿晚餐，那一幕仍然历历在目。我坐在桌子旁，爸爸在急切地说话。奶奶坐在我对面，弯曲的下巴山羊似的一遍一遍嚼着嘴里的芦笋，时不时地喝几口冰水，她到底听没听进去爸爸的只言片语，不得而知。她偶尔恼火地瞅一眼时钟，可是上床睡觉时间尚早。“你是撒旦计划的知情参与者。”爸爸说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grandma had a memorable way of laughing at the end of these sermons. It was a sort of sigh, a long, drawn-out leaking of breath, that finished with her eyes rolling upward in a lazy imitation of exasperation, as if she wanted to throw her hands in the air but was too tired to complete the gesture. Then she'd smile -- not a soothing smile for someone else but a smile for herself, of baffled amusement, a smile that to me always seemed to say, Ain't nothin' funnier than real life, I tell you what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听完这一大段说教，奶奶发出令人难忘的笑声。她长叹一声，慢慢呼出一口气，最后恼火地翻着眼珠，仿佛想把手伸向空中，但是太累了，无法完成这个手势。接着她微笑了——不是安慰别人的微笑，而是给自己的微笑。在我看来，这个微笑既带着困惑，又饶有兴致，似乎在说：我说得对吧，没有比现实生活更有意思的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This scene played every day, sometimes several times a day, for the rest of the trip. All followed a similar script. Dad, his fervor kindled, would drone for an hour or more, reciting the same lines over and over, fueled by some internal passion that burned long after the rest of us had been lectured into a cold stupor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're called Apache tears," she said. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small black stone, dirty and jagged, covered in veins of gray and white like cracked glass. "And this is how they look after they've been polished a bit." From her other pocket she withdrew a second stone, which was inky black and so smooth it felt soft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们叫阿帕奇眼泪。”说着，她把手伸进口袋，掏出一块脏兮兮的黑色小石头，上面凹凸不平，布满碎玻璃一样的灰白色纹理。“它们抛光后是这个样子。”她从另一个口袋掏出又一块石头，这块石头又黑又滑，给人柔软的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a scorching afternoon, so hot you couldn't walk barefoot on the pavement, when Grandma took me and Richard for a drive through the desert, having wrestled us into seatbelts, which we'd never worn before. We drove until the road began to incline, then kept driving as the asphalt turned to dust beneath our tires, and still we kept going, Grandma weaving higher and higher into the bleached hills, coming to a stop only when the dirt road ended and a hiking trail began. Then we walked. Grandma was winded after a few minutes, so she sat on a flat red stone and pointed to a sandstone rock formation in the distance, formed of crumbling spires, each a little ruin, and told us to hike to it. Once there, we were to hunt for nuggets of black rock.</div>

<div class="line_en">According to Grandma, a hundred years ago a tribe of Apaches had fought the U. S. Cavalry on those faded rocks. The tribe was outnumbered: the battle lost, the war over. All that was left to do was wait to die. Soon after the battle began, the warriors became trapped on a ledge. Unwilling to suffer a humiliating defeat, cut down one by one as they tried to break through the cavalry, they mounted their horses and charged off the face of the mountain. When the Apache women found their broken bodies on the rocks below, they cried huge, desperate tears, which turned to stone when they touched the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="据奶奶说，一百年前，一支阿帕奇部落曾在那些褪色的岩石上与美国骑兵交战。部落人数不占优势，战斗以他们的失利而告终。剩下能做的便是等死。战斗开始后不久，勇士们就被困在了一块岩脊上。他们不愿遭受战败的耻辱，在奋力突破骑兵队时被一个个砍死，于是骑上马背冲下了山崖。当阿帕奇的女人们在下面的岩石上找到丈夫们的碎尸时，她们放声痛哭，绝望的眼泪一落到地面，便化作了石头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Richard identified both as obsidian. "These are volcanic rock," he said in his best encyclopedic voice. "But this isn't." He kicked a washed-out stone and waved at the formation. "This is sediment." Richard had a talent for scientific trivia. Usually I ignored his lecturing but today I was gripped by it, and by this strange, thirsty terrain. We hiked around the formation for an hour, returning to Grandma with our shirtfronts sagging with stones. Grandma was pleased; she could sell them. She put them in the trunk, and as we made our way back to the trailer, she told us the legend of the Apache tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德认出这两块石头都是黑曜石。“这些是火山石，”他用他那百科全书式无所不知的声音说，“但这块不是，”他用脚踢了踢一块褪色的石头，挥手指着那块岩层说：“这是沉积物。”理查德有研究科学冷知识的天赋。往常我不大理会他的讲解，但今天很感兴趣，被这片奇异、焦渴的地面深深吸引。我们绕着岩层走了一个小时才回到奶奶那里，用衬衣兜了很多石头。奶奶很高兴，她可以卖掉它们。她把石头放进后备厢，在开车返回活动房的路上，给我们讲了阿帕奇眼泪的传说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Grandma never told us what happened to the women. The Apaches were at war but had no warriors, so perhaps she thought the ending too bleak to say aloud. The word "slaughter" came to mind, because slaughter is the word for it, for a battle when one side mounts no defense. It's the word we used on the farm. We slaughtered chickens, we didn't fight them. A slaughter was the likely outcome of the warriors' bravery. They died as heroes, their wives as slaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶从未告诉我们那些女人的结局。阿帕奇部落身陷战事却没有了战士，所以也许是她觉得结局太残酷，没有说出口。我的脑海闪现“屠宰”一词，因为这个词就是为此，为一方毫无抵抗的战斗而设。这是我们在农场用的词。我们屠宰鸡鸭，并不需要与它们战斗一番。勇士们的英勇很可能换来一场屠杀。他们是英雄，死了，而他们的妻子成了奴隶，也死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we drove to the trailer, the sun dipping in the sky, its last rays reaching across the highway, I thought about the Apache women. Like the sandstone altar on which they had died, the shape of their lives had been determined years before -- before the horses began their gallop, their sorrel bodies arching for that final collision. Long before the warriors' leap it was decided how the women would live and how they would die. By the warriors, by the women themselves. Decided. Choices, numberless as grains of sand, had layered and compressed, coalescing into sediment, then into rock, until all was set in stone.</div>

I found myself glancing at the vacant Arizona sky, hoping to see her black form swelling out of the earth, laying claim to her half of the heavens. But she was not there. More than the sight of her, I missed her caresses -- the wind she sent through canyons and ravines to sweep through my hair every morning. In Arizona, there was no wind. There was just one heat-stricken hour after another.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="车子撞上第一根电线杆时，我醒了过来。我睡在姐姐脚下的地板上，头上蒙着一条毯子。我想坐起来，但车子摇晃着向前冲去——感觉它快要散架了——奥黛丽摔到了我身上。我看不清发生了什么，但我能感觉到，也能听见。又是砰的一声巨响，一个倾斜，坐在前排的母亲尖叫了一声“泰勒！”最后是一阵剧烈的颠簸，之后一切戛然而止，四周鸦雀无声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I tried to shout but my face was wedged under the seat, my cheek pressed to the floor. I struggled under Audrey's weight as she shouted my name. Finally, I arched my back and pushed her off, then stuck my head out of the blanket and said, "Here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想大喊，但我的脸被挤在座位底下，脸颊紧贴着地板。奥黛丽喊我名字时，我还在她的重压下挣扎。最后，我弓起背把她推开，把头伸出毯子说：“我在这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked around. Tyler had twisted his upper body so that he was practically climbing into the backseat, his eyes bulging as he took in every cut, every bruise, every pair of wide eyes. I could see his face but it didn't look like his face. Blood gushed from his mouth and down his shirt. I closed my eyes, trying to forget the twisted angles of his bloodstained teeth. When I opened them again, it was to check everyone else. Richard was holding his head, a hand over each ear like he was trying to block out a noise. Audrey's nose was strangely hooked and blood was streaming from it down her arm. Luke was shaking but I couldn't see any blood. I had a gash on my forearm from where the seat's frame had caught hold of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我环顾四周。泰勒扭动着上半身几乎是爬进了后车座，看着每个人的伤口、瘀青和惊呆的双眼，他的眼睛瞪得越来越大。我能看见他的脸，但那张脸不像是他的了。血从他的嘴里涌出来，流到了衬衫上。我闭上眼睛，试图忘记他沾满鲜血歪歪曲曲的牙齿。我再次睁开眼睛，看了看其他人。理查德正两手捂着耳朵抱住头，像是在努力堵住一阵噪音。奥黛丽的鼻子弯曲成了奇怪的钩状，鲜血从鼻子里流出来，沿着胳膊往下淌。卢克浑身颤抖，但我没看见他身上有血。我的前臂有个口子，是被车座框夹伤的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are power lines on the car," Dad said. "Nobody gets out till they've shut them off." His door opened, and for a moment I thought he'd been electrocuted, but then I saw he'd pitched himself far enough so that his body had never touched the car and the ground at the same time. I remember peering at him through my shattered window as he circled the car, his red cap pushed back so the brim reached upward, licking the air. He looked strangely boyish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“车被电线缠住了，”父亲说，“都先别下车，等着断电。”车门开了，一时之间我还以为他会被电死，但接着我看见他向前倾，跌了足够远，极力避免身体同时与车子和地面接触。我记得透过破碎的车窗凝视他，看他绕着车转圈，他的红帽子被推向脑后，帽檐迎着风向上伸着。真奇怪，他看上去有些孩子气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a glare on the windshield from the morning sun. I saw crisscrossing patterns of fissures and cracks. The sight was familiar. I'd seen hundreds of shattered windshields in the junkyard, each one unique, with its particular spray of gossamer extruding from the point of impact, a chronicle of the collision. The cracks on our windshield told their own story. Their epicenter was a small ring with fissures circling outward. The ring was directly in front of the passenger seat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨的阳光照在挡风玻璃上，反射出一道强光。我看见纵横交错的裂缝。这个场景很是熟悉。我在废料场见过上百块破碎的挡风玻璃，每一块都独一无二，从撞击点向外发散的独特的蛛丝网是撞击的记录。我们这块挡风玻璃上的裂缝讲述了它们自己的故事。裂缝正中心是一个向外延伸裂开的小圆圈，圆圈就在副驾驶座正前方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leaned over the seat to see who he was talking to, and only then realized how serious the accident had been. The front half of the car had been compressed, the engine arched, curving back over itself, like a fold in solid rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我斜靠在座位上看他在跟谁说话，接着才意识到事故有多严重。车的前半部被挤成一团，发动机呈拱形，像坚硬岩石上的褶皱一样向后弯曲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He circled the car then stopped, crouching low, bringing his head level with the passenger seat. "Are you okay?" he said. Then he said it again. The third time he said it, his voice quivered.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was told later that the farmer whose tractor we'd hit rushed from his house. He'd called the police, which we knew would bring trouble because the car wasn't insured, and none of us had been wearing seatbelts. It took perhaps twenty minutes after the farmer informed Utah Power of the accident for them to switch off the deadly current pulsing through the lines. Then Dad lifted Mother from the station wagon and I saw her face -- her eyes, hidden under dark circles the size of plums, and the swelling distorting her soft features, stretching some, compressing others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来有人告诉我，我们撞上了一个农民的拖拉机。他从家里冲了出来，打电话报了警。这下麻烦大了，因为我们的车没上保险，而且当时我们没一个人系安全带。那个农民将事故通报给犹他州电力公司之后过了大约二十分钟，他们才关掉了流经电线的致命电流。爸爸这才从旅行车里把母亲抱了出来，我看见她的脸——她的眼睛藏在李子大小的黑眼圈下面，柔和的五官变得肿胀扭曲，有的地方拉长了，有的地方收缩了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother was laid on the sofa. She mumbled that the light hurt her eyes. We closed the blinds. She wanted to be in the basement, where there were no windows, so Dad carried her downstairs and I didn't see her for several hours, not until that evening, when I used a dull flashlight to bring her dinner. When I saw her, I didn't know her. Both eyes were a deep purple, so deep they looked black, and so swollen I couldn't tell whether they were open or closed. She called me Audrey, even after I corrected her twice. "Thank you, Audrey, but just dark and quiet, that's fine. Dark. Quiet. Thank you. Come check on me again, Audrey, in a little while."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲被抱到沙发上。她喃喃地说，光线太刺眼了，于是我们把窗帘拉上。她想待在地下室，那里没有窗户，于是爸爸把她抱下楼。几个小时里我都没见到她，直到那天晚上我打着暗淡的手电筒给她送晚饭。见到她时，我都快认不出她了。她双眼呈深紫色，深得发黑，肿得让我分不清是睁着还是闭着。她叫我奥黛丽，甚至在我纠正了她两次后依然如此。“谢谢你，奥黛丽，只要黑暗和安静，就很好。黑暗，安静。谢谢你！过一小会儿再来看我啊，奥黛丽。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't know how we got home, or when, but I remember that the mountain face glowed orange in the morning light. Once inside, I watched Tyler spit streams of crimson down the bathroom sink. His front teeth had smashed into the steering wheel and been displaced, so that they jutted backward toward the roof of his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道我们怎么回的家，也不知道什么时候回的家，但我记得那座山在晨曦中泛着橙色的光芒。一回到家，我就看见泰勒把一口口红色血水吐到卫生间洗手池里。他的前门牙猛撞上方向盘错位了，所以牙齿朝后向上腭突起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother didn't come out of the basement for a week. Every day the swelling worsened, the black bruises turned blacker. Every night I was sure her face was as marked and deformed as it was possible for a face to be, but every morning it was somehow darker, more tumid. After a week, when the sun went down, we turned off the lights and Mother came upstairs. She looked as if she had two objects strapped to her forehead, large as apples, black as olives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲整整一周都没从地下室出来。她的脸肿得越来越厉害，瘀青也越来越严重。每天晚上，我都确信她脸上的痕迹不可能更触目了，但每天早晨，不知为何她的脸却更黑更肿。一个星期后，等太阳下山，我们关上灯，母亲上楼了。她的额头就像绑着两个东西，大得像苹果，黑得像橄榄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was never any more talk of a hospital. The moment for such a decision had passed, and to return to it would be to return to all the fury and fear of the accident itself. Dad said doctors couldn't do anything for her anyhow. She was in God's hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the coming months, Mother called me by many names. When she called me Audrey I didn't worry, but it was troubling when we had conversations in which she referred to me as Luke or Tony, and in the family it has always been agreed, even by Mother herself, that she's never been quite the same since the accident. We kids called her Raccoon Eyes. We thought it was a great joke, once the black rings had been around for a few weeks, long enough for us to get used to them and make them the subject of jokes. We had no idea it was a medical term. Raccoon eyes. A sign of serious brain injury.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来几个月，母亲用许多名字称呼我。她叫我奥黛丽我倒不怎么担心，但我们交谈时她把我叫成卢克或者托尼，就让我很不安。全家人包括她自己一致认为，自从车祸后，她便再也不复从前。我们孩子都叫她“浣熊眼”，觉得这个外号很好笑。她有黑眼圈已经好几周了，我们早习以为常，以至于开起它们的玩笑。当时我们丝毫不知道这竟然是一个医学术语。浣熊眼，严重脑损伤的征兆之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyler's guilt was all-consuming. He blamed himself for the accident, then kept on blaming himself for every decision that was made thereafter, every repercussion, every reverberation that clanged down through the years. He laid claim to that moment and all its consequences, as if time itself had commenced the instant our station wagon left the road, and there was no history, no context, no agency of any kind until he began it, at the age of seventeen, by falling asleep at the wheel. Even now, when Mother forgets any detail, however trivial, that look comes into his eyes -- the one he had in the moments after the collision, when blood poured from his own mouth as he took in the scene, raking his eyes over what he imagined to be the work of his hands and his hands only.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒被内疚吞噬。多年以来，他为这次事故，之后又不断为此事造成的每一个决定、每一声铿锵有力的回响责怪自己。他紧紧抓住那一刻和之后的一切后果，仿佛时间本身起始于我们的旅行车驶离公路的那一瞬，没有历史，没有缘起，没有任何外力，直到十七岁的他在开车时睡着，时间才被开启。即使是现在，只要母亲忘记了任何不管多么微不足道的细节，他的眼里就会流露出那个神情——他在撞车后的神情，他自己嘴里流着鲜血，对现场遍览无遗，他用目光扫视着他自认为出自他手且只出自他手的这幕作品。">查看中文翻译</div>

A decade later my understanding would shift, part of my heavy swing into adulthood, and after that the accident would always make me think of the Apache women, and of all the decisions that go into making a life -- the choices people make, together and on their own, that combine to produce any single event.
