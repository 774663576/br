<div class="line_en">The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard gaoler-joke was, "Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!"</div>

<div class="line_en">His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease -- a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有匆匆的告别的话和祝愿，但很快便结束了——因为这是每天的例行公事，而拉福斯的人那天又忙着准备晚上的一个罚钱游戏和一个小型音乐会。有关的人挤到铁栅边去掉眼泪，可是计划中的文娱项目却少了二十个人，需要增补，而关门时间又已临近。时间太短了，到时候公用房间和走廊就要由獒犬通夜占领。囚犯们远远不是麻木不仁或缺乏同情心的，他们这种生活态度只是当时的条件逼成的罢了。同样，虽然有微妙的不同，某些人又无疑曾受到某种狂热和激动的支使去跟断头台作过徒然的斗争，结果死在断头台上。这并非言过其实，而是受到疯狂震撼的公众在心灵传染上的一种疯狂病。在瘟疫流行的时候，有人会受到那病的秘密吸引，产生一种可怕的偶然冲动，要想死于瘟疫，人们心里都有类似的奇怪倾向，只是有待环境诱发而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving, anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men, the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette, in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr. Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the Carmagnole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的法官们头戴饰有羽毛的帽子，坐在审判席上，别的人主要戴的是佩三色徽章的红色粗质便帽。看着陪审团和乱纷纷的观众，他可能以为正常秩序颠倒了过来，是罪犯在审判着正直的人呢！城市中最卑贱、最残忍、最邪恶的，而且从来没缺少过那份卑贱、残忍和邪恶劲的人现在成了主宰全场的精灵。他们或品头论足，或鼓掌喝彩，或大叫反对，或猜测估计，或推波助澜，一律是肆无忌惮。男人大部分带着某种正规武器，女人有的带短刀，有的带匕首，有的则一边看热闹，一边吃喝，许多女人打着毛线。在打毛线的妇女中有一个人手里打着线、腋下夹着线团，坐在前排一个男人身边。自从他离开城门之后，他便没再见过那男人，但他马上想起那就是德伐日。他注意到那女的在他耳边说过一两次话，便估计她是他的妻子。但是这两个人最令他注意的是，虽然都尽可能坐得离他近一点儿，却从来不瞧他一眼。他们好像下定了顽强的决心等待着什么，眼睛只望着陪审团，从不望别的。曼内特医生坐在庭长席下面的座位上，衣着朴素跟平时一样，就囚犯所见而言，只有他和罗瑞先生跟法庭无关，穿的也是日常服装，而不是粗糙的卡尔马尼奥拉装。">查看中文翻译</div>

Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye -- in fact, had rather passed out of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance -- until three days ago; when he had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called Darnay.</div>

<div class="line_en">Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States -- as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后传讯了曼内特医生。他崇高的声望和清晰的回答给了人们出色的印象。他继续指出被告是他在长期监禁获释后的第一位朋友，在他和他女儿客居海外时，他一气留在英国，对他俩一片赤诚，关怀备至。他又说，那儿的贵族政府很不喜欢被告，实际上曾经以英国的敌人和合众国的朋友的罪名对他进行过审判，意图杀害。医生依靠直接事实的威力和他自己的真诚，小心翼翼、字斟句酌地介绍了上述情况，于是陪审团的意见跟群众的意见统一了。最后他请求让此时在场的．，个英国人罗瑞先生作证。罗瑞先生曾跟他一样在英国那场审讯中作过证人，可以证明他对该审判的叙述属实。这时陪审团宣布他们听到的材料已经足够，若是庭长满意，他们可以立即投票了。">查看中文翻译</div>

No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.</div>
