<div class="line_en">Davos had come to White Harbor as an envoy, but they had made him a captive. His chambers were large, airy, and handsomely furnished, but there were guards outside his doors. From his window he could see the streets of White Harbor beyond the castle walls, but he was not allowed to walk them. He could see the harbor too, and had watched Merry Midwife make her way down the firth. Casso Mogat had waited four days instead of three before departing. Another fortnight had passed since then.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two marble mermen flanked his lordship's court, Fishfoot's smaller cousins. As the guards threw open the doors, a herald slammed the butt of his staff against an old plank floor. "Ser Davos of House Seaworth," he called in a ringing voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Manderly's household guard wore cloaks of blue-green wool and carried silver tridents in place of common spears. One went before him, one behind, and one to either side.

<div class="line_en">As many times as he had visited White Harbor, Davos had never set foot inside the New Castle, much less the Merman's Court. Its walls and floor and ceiling were made of wooden planks notched cunningly together and decorated with all the creatures of the sea. As they approached the dais, Davos trod on painted crabs and clams and starfish, half-hidden amongst twisting black fronds of seaweed and the bones of drowned sailors. On the walls to either side, pale sharks prowled painted blue-green depths, whilst eels and octopods slithered amongst rocks and sunken ships. Shoals of herring and great codfish swam between the tall arched windows. Higher up, near where the old fishing nets drooped down from the rafters, the surface of the sea had been depicted. To his right a war galley stroked serene against the rising sun; to his left, a battered old cog raced before a storm, her sails in rags. Behind the dais a kraken and grey leviathan were locked in battle beneath the painted waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然曾经无数次造访白港，戴佛斯却从未走进过这座新城堡，比去人鱼厅的次数还少。城堡的墙壁、地板和天花板是用厚木板巧妙地拼接而成，上面装饰着各种各样的海洋生物。当他们靠近台子的时候，戴佛斯就踩在画出来的螃蟹、蛤蜊和海星上，它们在海藻纠结缠绕的黑色叶片和溺死的水手骨头之间若隐若现。另一边的墙面上，白色鲨鱼潜游于蓝绿色深海之中，同时，鳗鱼和八爪鱼穿梭潜行于岩石和沉船之间。一群鲱鱼和大鳕鱼在高大的拱形窗户上游来游去。再向高处，画的是海面，旁边则是旧渔网沿着椽子垂下来。在他右边，一艘战船逆着朝阳打破了平静；在他左边，一艘旧船正在逃离风暴，而船帆已经破烂不堪。在台子的后方，一只海怪和一头灰色巨兽在战斗中被锁在画出来的波浪之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos had hoped to speak with Wyman Manderly alone, but he found a crowded court. Along the walls, the women outnumbered the men by five to one; what few males he did see had long grey beards or looked too young to shave. There were septons as well, and holy sisters in white robes and grey. Near the top of the hall stood a dozen men in the blue and silver-grey of House Frey. Their faces had a likeness a blind man could have seen; several wore the badge of the Twins, two towers connected by a bridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯本期望能与威曼·曼德勒单独会面，结果他发现大厅里挤满了人。沿着墙壁看过去，女人比男人多五倍；少数几个看见的男人，要么留着长长的灰胡子，要么太年轻还没蓄须。他还看见了修士，以及身穿白色和灰色长袍的修女。大厅上方站着一群身穿蓝色和银灰色衣服的佛雷。他们的长相就连瞎子都能看出来是如此相似；其中一些佩戴着挛河城的徽章——两座高塔中间连接着一座桥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nor did he find any welcome in the pale blue eyes of Wyman Manderly. His lordship's cushioned throne was wide enough to accommodate three men of common girth, yet Manderly threatened to overflow it. His lordship sagged into his seat, his shoulders slumped, his legs splayed, his hands resting on the arms of his throne as if the weight of them were too much to bear. Gods be good, thought Davos, when he saw Lord Wyman's face, this man looks half a corpse. His skin was pallid, with an undertone of grey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从威曼·曼德勒那双淡蓝色眼睛里也没看出一丁点欢迎的意思。伯爵大人的靠垫宝座非常宽，足以容纳三个普通体型的人，但是曼德勒仍然快从里面溢了出来。伯爵大人坠进座位，双肩下垂、双腿摊开，双手搁在宝座的双臂上，就像这双手重得抬不起来一样。诸神慈悲，当看到威曼伯爵的脸时，戴佛斯心想，这人看起来就像已经死了一半。他的皮肤也是灰暗中透着苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">None chose to honor Davos with a name. The maester was the first to speak. "You stand before Wyman Manderly, Lord of White Harbor and Warden of the White Knife, Shield of the Faith, Defender of the Dispossessed, Lord Marshal of the Mander, a Knight of the Order of the Green Hand," he said. "In the Merman's Court, it is customary for vassals and petitioners to kneel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有一个人向戴佛斯通报姓名。首先开口的是学士：“你面前是威曼·曼德勒，白港伯爵及白刃河守护者，教会庇护者，无依无靠之人的防护者，曼德河元帅，绿手任命的骑士。”他说，“在人鱼厅，臣属和请愿者照例是应该跪下的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kings and corpses always draw attendants, the old saying went. So it was with Manderly. Left of the high seat stood a maester nigh as fat as the lord he served, a rosy-cheeked man with thick lips and a head of golden curls. Ser Marlon claimed the place of honor at his lordship's right hand. On a cushioned stool at his feet perched a plump pink lady. Behind Lord Wyman stood two younger women, sisters by the look of them. The elder wore her brown hair bound in a long braid. The younger, no more than fifteen, had an even longer braid, dyed a garish green.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王和死人身边的侍从最多，他想起了那句老话。曼德勒伯爵就是这样。宝座的左边站着一位跟伯爵大人一样肥胖的学士，长着玫瑰色双颊、厚嘴唇和一头金色卷发。玛龙爵士占据了他的领主大人右手边的荣誉位置。伯爵脚边的垫子凳子上坐着一位丰满的粉红女士。威曼伯爵的身后则是两位年轻一些的女士，看起来像是一对姐妹。年长的把棕色头发扎成长长的辫子。年轻的那个，还不到十五岁，留着更长的辫子，染成了夸张俗气的绿色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The onion knight would have bent his knee, but a King's Hand could not; to do so would suggest that the king he served was less than this fat lord. "I have not come as a petitioner," Davos replied. "I have a string of titles too. Lord of the Rainwood, Admiral of the Narrow Sea, Hand of the King."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洋葱骑士本该跪下，但国王之手却不行。一旦他照做，就意味着他效劳的国王比不上眼前这个肥伯爵。“我并非作为一名请愿者而来，”戴佛斯回答，“我也有一串头衔——雨林伯爵，狭海的海军上将，以及国王之手。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="雷加·佛雷接着开口了。“悲伤和死亡，是的…而这位洋葱大人会用他关于复仇的言论带给你更多的悲伤和死亡。睁开眼睛吧，就像我祖父大人一样。五王之战已经结束了。托曼是我们的国王，我们唯一的国王。我们必须帮助他缝合这场悲怆战争的伤口。作为劳勃的亲血肉，雄鹿和金狮的继承人，铁王座应该依法传给他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Merman's Court had grown still. Davos could feel the chill in the air. Lord Wyman was looking down at Rhaegar as if he were a roach in need of a hard heel… yet then, abruptly, he gave a ponderous nod that set his chins to wobbling. "A dog, aye. He brought us only grief and death. A vile dog indeed. Say on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人鱼厅变得鸦雀无声。戴佛斯都能感觉到空气中刺骨的寒冷。威曼伯爵向下看着雷加，好像他是一只需要狠踩一脚的大蟑螂…但是忽然的，他猛地点了点头，下巴上的肉都随之抖动起来。“一条狗，是的。他只给我们带来了悲伤和死亡。真是一条野狗。说下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Be quiet, wretched child," scolded Lady Leona. "Young girls should be an ornament to the eye, not an ache in the ear." She seized the girl by her braid and pulled her squealing from the hall. There went my only friend in this hall, thought Davos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“安静，讨厌的孩子。”里雅夫人责备道。“年轻女孩应该是眼睛的享受，而不是耳边的聒噪。”她抓住女孩的发辫，把尖叫着的孩子拖出大厅。我在这里唯一的朋友走了，戴佛斯想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rhaegar shrugged. "Marriage will soften her, I have no doubt. A firm hand and a quiet word."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷加耸耸肩。“婚姻会把她磨平的，对这一点我毫不怀疑。一只强有力的手，一句简单的话就行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wylla has always been a willful child," her sister said, by way of apology. "I fear that she will make a willful wife."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lord of White Harbor pushed himself to his feet. The effort brought a red flush to his neck. "You are still a smuggler, ser, come to steal my gold and blood. You would take my son's head. I think I shall take yours instead. Guards! Seize this man!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白港伯爵用力起身。这个剧烈的动作让他脖子都红了。“你仍然是一个走私犯，爵士，想来偷走我的金子和血液。你还想要我儿子的脑袋。不过相反的，我觉得我应该要了你的脑袋。守卫！把这个人给我绑了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Davos could even think to move, he was surrounded by silver tridents. "My lord," he said, "I am an envoy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯还没反应过来要做任何动作，已经被一圈银色的三叉戟包围。“大人，”他说，“我只是个使节。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If not, there are the silent sisters." Lord Wyman shifted in his seat. "As for you, Onion Knight, I have heard sufficient treason for one day. You would have me risk my city for a false king and a false god. You would have me sacrifice my only living son so Stannis Baratheon can plant his puckered arse upon a throne to which he has no right. I will not do it. Not for you. Not for your lord. Not for any man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果不行，还有静默姐妹。”威曼伯爵在椅子里动了动。“至于你，洋葱骑士，今天我已经听够了叛国之言了。你我把我的城市置于一个错误的国王和一个错误的神灵的威胁之下。你会令我牺牲唯一幸存的儿子，帮助史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩把他发皱的屁股安置到不属于他的王座上去。我不会这么做的。不会为你这么做。不会为你的大人这么做。也不会为任何人这么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you? You came sneaking into my city like a smuggler. I say you are no lord, no knight, no envoy, only a thief and a spy, a peddler of lies and treasons. I should tear your tongue out with hot pincers and deliver you to the Dreadfort to be flayed. But the Mother is merciful, and so am I." He beckoned to Ser Marlon. "Cousin, take this creature to the Wolf's Den and cut off his head and hands. I want them brought to me before I sup. I shall not be able to eat a bite until I see this smuggler's head upon a spike, with an onion shoved between his lying teeth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是吗？你跟一个走私犯似的偷偷摸摸潜进我的城市。我敢说你根本不是个领主，不是个骑士，不是个使节，只是个小偷和密探，只是一个说谎和谋反的小贩。我应该用滚烫的钳子把你的舌头拔出来，然后把你送到恐怖堡剥皮。但是圣母慈悲，我也一样。”他对玛龙爵士示意。“表弟，把这东西带到狼穴里，脑袋和手都砍了。我希望在晚餐前看到它们。要是我看不到这个走私犯的脑袋插在长枪上，并且牙齿还含着一颗洋葱，我一口晚饭都吃不下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
