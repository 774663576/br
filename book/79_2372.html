<div class="line_en">She looked out the kitchen window and saw him just sitting there on the curb, not playing with his trucks or the wagon or even the balsa glider that had pleased him so much all the last week since Jack had brought it home. He was just sitting there, watching for their shopworn VW, his elbows planted on his thighs and his chin propped in his hands, a five-year old kid waiting for his daddy.</div>

<div class="line_en">She hung the dish towel over the bar by the sink and went downstairs, buttoning the top two buttons of her house dress. Jack and his pride! Hey no, Al, I don't need an advance. I'm okay for a while. The hallway walls were gouged and marked with crayons, grease pencil, spray paint. The stairs were steep and splintery. The whole building smelled of sour age, and what sort of place was this for Danny after the small neat brick house in Stovington? The people living above them on the third floor weren't married, and while that didn't bother her, their constant, rancorous fighting did. It scared her. The guy up there was Tom, and after the bars had closed and they had returned home, the fights would start in earnest -- the rest of the week was just a prelim in comparison. The Friday Night Fights, Jack called them, but it wasn't funny. The woman -- her name was Elaine -- would at last be reduced to tears and to repeating over and over again:</div>

<div class="line_en">Her sense of grief washed over her again but she was on the walk now and she smothered it. Sweeping her dress under her and sitting down on the curb beside him, she said: "What's up, doc?" He smiled at her but it was perfunctory. "Hi, Mom."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't, Tom. Please don't. Please don't." And he would shout at her. Once they had even awakened Danny, and Danny slept like a corpse. The next morning Jack caught Tom going out and had spoken to him on the sidewalk at some length. Tom started to bluster and Jack had said something else to him, too quietly for Wendy to hear, and Tom had only shaken his head sullenly and walked away. That had been a week ago and for a few days things had been better, but since the weekend things had been working back to normal -- excuse me, abnormal. It was bad for the boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别这样，汤姆。求你别这样，求求你，别这样。”这时汤姆就对她大吼大叫。有一次他们甚至把丹尼吵醒了，丹尼一向都是睡得很死的。第二天早晨，杰克把汤姆叫了出去，在人行道上跟他谈了一会儿。汤姆开始变得暴躁起来，杰克又给他说了些什么，声音很小，温迪没听见，但汤姆只是恼怒地晃了晃脑袋便走开了。那是一周前发生的事，情况好转了几天，但到了周末，情况又恢复了正常——抱歉，应该是不正常。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went back to staring up the street. He flexed a little, as if to rise, but the beetle coming was much newer, and much brighter red. He relaxed again. She wondered just how hard this move to Colorado had been on Danny. He was closemouthed about it, but it bothered her to see him spending so much time by himself. In Vermont three of Jack's fellow faculty members had had children about Danny's age -- and there had been the preschool -- but in this neighborhood there was no one for him to play with. Most of the apartments were occupied by students attending CU, and of the few married couples here on Arapahoe Street, only a tiny percentage had children. She had spotted perhaps a dozen of high school or junior high school age, three infants, and that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼又转过头，往街道远方望去。他身子一屈，似乎要站起来，但是，驶过的车子比他们家那辆新得多，红漆也鲜亮得多。他又放松下来。温迪很想知道，这次搬到科罗拉多来对丹尼来说有多么难以接受。他虽闭口不谈，但看到他很多时间都是自个儿呆着，她感到十分不安。以前在佛蒙特，杰克3个同事的家里有跟丹尼同龄的孩子——而且那时还有幼儿园——但是，在这个居民区，找不到可以和丹尼一起玩的小孩。公寓里大多住着科罗拉多大学的学生，阿拉帕霍街上不多的几对夫妇中只有极少数有孩子。她在附近只看到过十来个中学生和3个婴儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was jolted out of her reverie and floundering for an answer. She and Jack had discussed ways they might handle just such a question from Danny, ways that had varied from evasion to the plain truth with no varnish on it. But Danny had never asked. Not until now, when she was feeling low and least prepared for such a question. Yet he was looking at her, maybe reading the confusion on her face and forming his own ideas about that. She thought that to children adult motives and actions must seem as bulking and ominous as dangerous animals seen in the shadows of a dark forest. They were jerked about like puppets, having only the vaguest notions why. The thought brought her dangerously close to tears again, and while she fought them off she leaned over, picked up the disabled glider, and turned it over in her hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从纷乱的思绪中惊醒过来，支支吾吾地盘算着怎么回答。她和杰克曾讨论过应付丹尼的这个问题的办法，包括从回避到据实相告的种种办法。但在此之前丹尼从未问过。可现在，她情绪低落，对回答这个问题毫无准备。丹尼望着她，也许读出了她脸上的茫然，正在形成他自己的看法。她想，对孩子来说，成年人的行为和动机必定像潜伏在黑黝黝的森林深处的危险动物一样诡谲、不祥。他们一家像木偶一样被驱来赶去，却阒然不知其中的原因。想到这里，她的眼泪又涌了上来。她忍住泪水，俯身捡起破损的滑翔机，然后将它翻过来拿在手里。">查看中文翻译</div>
