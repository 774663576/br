<div class="line_en">Then, when I was about eleven, I went to stay with Grans in Montauk for four weeks while August was having his big jaw surgery. This was the longest I'd ever been away from home, and I have to say it was so amazing to suddenly be free of all that stuff that made me so mad. No one stared at Grans and me when we went to town to buy groceries. No one pointed at us. No one even noticed us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，大概在我十一岁左右的时候，因为奥古斯特的下巴要动大手术，我便去蒙托克跟外婆一起住了四个星期。那是我离家最长的一段时间，我不得不说，那些让我愤怒不已的场面突然不见了，简直太神奇了。我们去街上买东西的时候，没有人盯着外婆和我看。没有人对我们指指点点。甚至都没有人注意我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grans was one of those grandmothers who do everything with their grandkids. She'd run into the ocean if I asked her to, even if she had nice clothes on. She would let me play with her makeup and didn't mind if I used it on her face to practice my face-painting skills. She'd take me for ice cream even if we hadn't eaten dinner yet. She'd draw chalk horses on the sidewalk in front of her house. One night, while we were walking back from town, I told her that I wished I could live with her forever. I was so happy there. I think it might have been the best time in my life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆是那种对孩子百依百顺的老人。如果我这么要求，即使她穿得严严实实，也会一头冲进大海里。她会让我玩她的化妆品，完全不在乎我是不是用它们在她脸上练习化妆技巧。即使还没有吃晚饭，她也会带我去吃冰淇淋。她还会在房子前的人行道上用粉笔画马。有一天晚上，我们从城里走回家，我对她说，我希望永远都跟她生活在一起。在那里，我是如此快乐。我觉得那是我生命中最好的时光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I never used to see August the way other people saw him. I knew he didn't look exactly normal, but I really didn't understand why strangers seemed so shocked when they saw him. Horrified. Sickened. Scared. There are so many words I can use to describe the looks on people's faces. And for a long time I didn't get it. I'd just get mad. Mad when they stared. Mad when they looked away. "What the heck are you looking at?" I'd say to people -- even grown-ups.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从来没有以他人的眼光来看待过奥古斯特。我知道他看起来并不正常，可是我实在搞不懂为什么陌生人在看见他的时候会显得如此震惊。恐惧。恶心。害怕。我可以用很多词语来描述人们脸上的表情。很长一段时间我都接受不了。我就是觉得愤怒。愤怒于他们直勾勾地盯着看，愤怒于他们扭过头去。“你到底在看什么鬼东西啊？”我会冲人们嚷嚷——甚至对大人也这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Coming home after four weeks felt very strange at first. I remember very vividly stepping through the door and seeing August running over to welcome me home, and for this tiny fraction of a moment I saw him not the way I've always seen him, but the way other people see him. It was only a flash, an instant while he was hugging me, so happy that I was home, but it surprised me because I'd never seen him like that before. And I'd never felt what I was feeling before, either: a feeling I hated myself for having the moment I had it. But as he was kissing me with all his heart, all I could see was the drool coming down his chin. And suddenly there I was, like all those people who would stare or look away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个星期后回到家，我一开始感觉非常陌生。那一幕我依然记忆犹新，我一进门，就看见奥古斯特奔跑过来欢迎我，在短短的一瞬间，我没有以我一贯的方式，而是用别人的目光去看他。只是一刹那，在他拥抱我、欢迎我回家的那一刻，我感到很奇怪，因为我以前从来没有那样看过他。我以前也从来没有过那样的感受：一种我痛恨自己有过的感受。但是当他全身心地亲吻我的时候，我只看见口水从他的下巴淌下来。突然之间我就那样了——像其他所有死盯着看或者掉过头去的人一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thankfully, that only lasted for a second: the moment I heard August laugh his raspy little laugh, it was over. Everything was back the way it had been before. But it had opened a door for me. A little peephole. And on the other side of the peephole there were two Augusts: the one I saw blindly, and the one other people saw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢天谢地，这种感觉只持续了一小会儿，在我听到奥古斯特沙哑笑声的那一刹那烟消云散。一切又回到从前的样子。但是这为我打开了一扇窗。一个小小的猫眼。在猫眼的另一边，有两个奥古斯特：一个是我盲目所见的他，另一个是别人眼中的他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I think the only person in the world I could have told any of this to was Grans, but I didn't. It was too hard to explain over the phone. I thought maybe when she came for Thanksgiving, I'd tell her what I felt. But just two months after I stayed with her in Montauk, my beautiful Grans died. It was so completely out of the blue. Apparently, she had checked herself into the hospital because she'd been feeling nauseous. Mom and I drove out to see her, but it's a three-hour drive from where we live, and by the time we got to the hospital, Grans was gone. A heart attack, they told us. Just like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个世界上我唯一愿意吐露这点心事的人，我想是外婆，但是我没有。要在电话上说清楚实在太困难了。我以为她可能会来过感恩节，到时再告诉她我的感受也不迟。但是，跟她一起在蒙托克仅仅两个月后，我美丽的外婆就去世了。这一切来得太突然了。显然，她去医院检查身体是因为她一直感觉有点恶心。妈妈和我开车去看她，但是路上开了三个小时，等到达医院的时候，外婆已经去了。他们告诉我们，她死于心脏病。就这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's so strange how one day you can be on this earth, and the next day not. Where did she go? Will I really ever see her again, or is that a fairy tale?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种感觉真是奇怪，一个人今天还在世上，第二天就不在了。她去哪里了？我真的会再见到她吗？或者这只是一个童话？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You see movies and TV shows where people receive horrible news in hospitals, but for us, with all our many trips to the hospital with August, there had always been good outcomes. What I remember the most from the day Grans died is Mom literally crumpling to the floor in slow, heaving sobs, holding her stomach like someone had just punched her. I've never, ever seen Mom like that. Never heard sounds like that come out of her. Even through all of August's surgeries, Mom always put on a brave face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你看电影和电视节目的时候，总是看到人们在医院里接到噩耗，但我们却不然，我们与奥古斯特的所有求医之旅，总是有好结果。外婆去世的那一天，我印象最深的，是妈妈缓慢而痛苦地呜咽着，几乎瘫倒在地，她捂住自己的肚子，好像被什么人重重地打了一拳。我从来没见过妈妈这样，从来没有听到过她发出这种声音。虽然奥古斯特经历了那么多次手术，但妈妈总是装出一副勇敢的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I love Auggie very, very much," she said softly. I can still remember her Portuguese accent, the way she rolled her r's. "But he has many angels looking out for him already, Via. And I want you to know that you have me looking out for you. Okay, menina querida? I want you to know that you are number one for me. You are my…" She looked out at the ocean and spread her hands out, like she was trying to smooth out the waves, "You are my everything. You understand me, Via? Tu es meu tudo."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很爱很爱奥吉。”她温柔地说。我还清楚记得她的葡萄牙口音，记得她卷舌发“r”音的方式。“但是他已经有很多天使在照看。维娅，我想让你知道，你有我照顾。好吗，孩子，亲爱的？我想让你知道，你对我来说是最重要的。你是我的……”她眺望着大海，伸出双臂，好像要努力平息海浪，“你是我的一切。你懂得我的意思吧，维娅？你就是我的全部。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On my last day in Montauk, Grans and I had watched the sun set on the beach. We had taken a blanket to sit on, but it had gotten chilly, so we wrapped it around us and cuddled and talked until there wasn't even a sliver of sun left over the ocean. And then Grans told me she had a secret to tell me: she loved me more than anyone else in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在蒙托克的最后一天，外婆和我在海滩看日落。我们带了一条用来垫屁股的毯子，但是天气寒冷，我们便围着它相互依偎着聊天，直到最后一抹夕阳消失在海面上。这时外婆说有个秘密要告诉我：她爱我胜过这世界上的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
