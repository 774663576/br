<div class="line_en">Someone had added a very old Buick car radio under the hotel truck's dashboard, and now, tinny and choked with static, the distinctive sound of John Fogerty's Creedence Clearwater Revival band came out of the speaker. Wendy and Danny were on their way down to Sidewinder. The day was clear and bright. Danny was turning Jack's orange library card over and over in his hands and seemed cheerful enough, but Wendy thought he looked drawn and tired, as if he hadn't been sleeping enough and was going on nervous energy alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知是谁在饭店卡车的仪表板下面装了一台老式的别克牌汽车收音机。此时，约翰·弗格蒂演唱组独具特色的歌声正从喇叭里流淌出来，有时由于干扰而中断。天气清爽明丽，温迪和丹尼在去塞德温得的路上。杰克橘黄色的借书卡在丹尼手中翻来翻去，他表面上显得兴致很高，但温迪看得出他很疲惫，好像没有睡够觉，强打着精神支撑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The song ended and the disc jockey came on. "Yeah, that's Creedence. And speakin of bad moon, it looks like it may be risin over the KMTX listening area before long, hard as it is to believe with the beautiful, springlike weather we've enjoyed for the last couple-three days. The KMTX Fearless Forecaster says high pressure will give way by one o'clock this afternoon to a widespread low-pressure area which is just gonna grind to a stop in our KMTX area, up where the air is rare. Temperatures will fall rapidly, and precipitation should start around dusk. Elevations under seven thousand feet, including the metro-Denver area, can expect a mixture of sleet and snow, perhaps freezing on some roads, and nothin but snow up here, cuz. We're lookin at one to three inches below seven thousand and possible accumulations of six to ten inches in Central Colorado and on the Slope. The Highway Advisory Board says that if you're plannin to tour the mountains in your car this afternoon or tonight, you should remember that the chain law will be in effect. And don't go nowhere unless you have to. Remember," the announcer added jocularly, "that's how the Donners got into trouble. They just weren't as close to the nearest Seven-Eleven as they thought."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="歌曲结束了，接着传来了节目主持人的声音。“好，刚才大家欣赏了弗格蒂演唱组的歌声。说到不吉的月亮，看来它可能不久即将升起。近日我们享受着春天般的日子，天气突变的消息实在令人难以置信。但是，高压将在今日午后1点之前为大面积的低压区所取代，气温将有大幅下降，预计降雪将在傍晚开始。海拔7000英尺以下的地区，包括丹佛市，将有雨夹雪，部分路面有冰冻；7000英尺以上的地区有大雪。预计7000英尺以下的地区降雨量在1－3英寸左右，科罗拉多州中部及山区将有6－10英寸的雪量。公路交通咨询委员会说，今日下午或夜间在山区驾车旅行务必给轮胎加挂链条。除非确有必要，请勿出门。切记！”然后，播音员打趣地说：“唐纳登山队就是在这样的天气遇上麻烦的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, she thought, this is the time. If you're going to bring it up, do it now or forever hold your peace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对，她想，现在时机正好。如果你想提出这件事，现在就做，否则就永远闭上嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess he did," Wendy said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是的。”温迪说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A Clairol commercial came on, and Wendy reached down and snapped the radio off. "You mind?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电台接着播送了一条广告，温迪伸手啪的一声关上了收音机。“不介意吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Getting cold feet?" Wendy asked. She was still thinking about that crack the disc jockey had made about the Donner Party.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“脚冷吗？”温迪问。她的心思仍然在节目主持人关于唐纳登山队的那句俏皮话上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure doesn't look much like snow, though," Danny added hopefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过天一点也看不出像要下雪的样子。”丹尼满怀希望地加了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Danny," she said, making her voice as casual as possible, "would you be happier if we went away from the Overlook? If we didn't stay the winter?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“丹尼，”她尽可能显得轻松自然地说。“假如我们离开远望饭店，你会开心些吗？如果我们不在这里过冬？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sometimes," she said carefully, "I get the idea that Daddy might be happier away from the Overlook, too." They passed a sign which read SIDEWINDER 18 mi. and then she took the truck cautiously around a hairpin and shifted up into second. She took no chances on these downgrades; they scared her silly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时，”她小心翼翼地说，“我想你爸爸也乐意离开远望饭店。”他们经过了一个上面写着“距塞德温得18英里”的标志牌，然后她全神贯注地驾车绕过了一个急转弯，随后又把挡位调到了二挡。坡道上她丝毫不敢大意，生怕有什么闪失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you really think so?" Danny asked. He looked at her with interest for a moment and then shook his head. "No, I don't think so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真是这样想的吗？”丹尼问。他饶有兴趣地盯着她看了一会儿，然后摇摇头。“不，我想不是这样的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because he's worried about us," Danny said, choosing his words carefully. It was hard to explain, he understood so little of it himself. He found himself harking back to an incident he had told Mr. Hallorann about, the big kid looking at department store TV sets and wanting to steal one. That had been distressing, but at least it had been clear what was going on, even to Danny, then little more than an infant. But grownups were always in a turmoil, every possible action muddied over by thoughts of the consequences, by self-doubt, by self-image, by feelings of love and responsibility. Every possible choice seemed to have drawbacks, and sometimes he didn't understand why the drawbacks were drawbacks. It was very hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为他要为我们考虑，”丹尼说，小心地选择着词语。太难解释了，因为他自己也不太明白。他发现自己讲给哈洛伦先生的那件事又回到了他的脑海里：那个大孩子盯着百货店的收音机，想偷走一台。那件事也很烦人，但是，虽然当时丹尼还很小，可他却很清楚正在发生什么。可是，大人总是处于混乱状态中，他们的一举一动都被前思后想、自我怀疑、自我形象、爱和责任感搞得一团糟，每种选择都不尽如人意，有时候他不明白那些选择为什么不如意。这对他来说太难了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He thinks…" Danny began again, and then looked at his mother quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他想…”丹尼又说，他很快地看了妈妈一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He thinks maybe we'll be lonely. And then he thinks that he likes it here and it's a good place for us. He loves us and doesn't want us to be lonely… or sad… but he thinks even if we are, it might be okay in the LONGRUN. Do you know LONGRUN?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他想我们可能会感到孤独。还有，他认为他喜欢这里的日子，认为对我们来说这是个好地方。他爱我们，不希望我们感到孤独…不快乐…但他认为即使我们感到孤独和不快乐，长远地看这也是有好处的。你明白长远是什么意思吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was watching the road, not looking at him, and he felt he could go on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看着路，没有看他，于是他觉得可以继续讲下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这些都不是我编的，妈妈。凭上帝起誓。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“知道什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别理会那个医生，”她说。“我相信托尼。我不知道他是干什么的或者他是谁，不知道他是不是你自己的一个特殊部分，或者从…从外面的什么地方来的，但我真的相信他，丹尼。如果你…他…认为我们应当离开这里，我们就离开。我们俩走，春天再和你爸爸团聚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, but the rest is all mixed up. Because he's different now."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hon, we couldn't afford a motel. It would have to be at my mother's." The hope in Danny's face died out. "I know --" he said, and stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">She shifted back to second as the grade steepened again. "No, doc, please don't say that. This talk is something we should have had weeks ago, I think. So please. What is it you know? I won't be mad. I can't be mad, because this is too important. Talk straight to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坡又陡起来，她把挡位又调回到二挡。“不，博士，别那样说。我想，几个星期以前我们就应该这样的谈谈了。你知道什么？我不会生气的，我不能生气，因为这太重要了。告诉我吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know how you feel about her," Danny said, and sighed.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得她怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy was shaken. Was it that bad between her and her mother? God, what hell for the boy if it was and he could really read their thoughts for each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bad," Danny said, and then rhyming, singsong, frightening her: "Bad. Sad. Mad. It's like she wasn't your mommy at all. Like she wanted to eat you." He looked at her, frightened. "And I don't like it there. She's always thinking about how she would be better for me than you. And how she could get me away from you. Mommy, I don't want to go there. I'd rather be at the Overlook than there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很不好，”丹尼说，接着是押韵的唱着歌，吓坏了她：“好像她根本就不是你妈妈，好像她要吃你。”他怯生生地看了看她。“我也不想住在那里。她总是想怎样才能比你对我好，怎样才能把我从你那里拉走。妈妈，我不想去姥姥家。去那里还不如留在远望饭店。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," he said, and smothered the two words that rose behind his lips after that simple negative: Not yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”他说，可是他咽回了紧跟在这个简单否定后面的几个字：暂时还没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy relaxed a little more. She put a hand on Danny's jeans-clad leg and squeezed it. "Your daddy has tried very hard," she said softly. "Because he loves us. And we love him, don't we?" He nodded gravely.</div>
