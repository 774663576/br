<div class="line_cn" title="“斯内普想要救我？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，不，想害死你的是我。那次魁地奇比赛的时候，你的朋友格兰杰小姐冲过来给斯内普施咒，无意中把我撞倒了。她破坏了我对你的凝视，其实只要再坚持几秒钟，我就把你从飞天扫帚上摔下去了。如果不是斯内普一直在旁边念一个反咒，想保住你的性命，我早就把你摔死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Severus?" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. "Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯内普？”奇洛大笑起来。这笑声也不是他平常那种尖厉刺耳的颤音，而是一种令人胆寒的冷笑。“是啊，斯内普看上去确实不像个好人，是吗？他像一只巨型的大蝙蝠到处乱飞，对我们倒是很有帮助。有他在那里放着，谁还会怀疑可——可——可怜的，结——结——结结巴巴的奇洛教——教授呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利无法相信这一切。这不可能是真的，不可能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course," said Quirrell coolly. "Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really… he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular… and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是这样，”奇洛冷冷地说，“你说他为什么要给你们的第二次比赛当裁判？他要确保我不再害你。真是可笑……其实他犯不着费这番心思。有邓布利多在场，我什么也做不成的。其他老师都以为斯内普想阻止格兰芬多队获胜，他确实弄得自己很不受人欢迎……不过，这一切都是浪费时间，不管怎么说，我今晚一定要把你干掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是你放那个巨怪进来的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是这样。我对付巨怪有一套特别的办法——你肯定已经看见了，我是怎么教训那边房间里的那个家伙的吧？倒霉的是，当大家都匆匆忙忙到处寻找巨怪时，早已对我起了疑心的斯内普直接赶到四楼，试图阻拦我——不仅我的巨怪没有把你打死，甚至那条三个头的大狗也没有把斯内普的腿咬断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this… but he's in London… I'll be far away by the time he gets back…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这面镜子是找到魔法石的钥匙，”奇洛喃喃地说，用手沿着四周的镜框敲了一遍。“只有邓布利多才拿得出这样的东西……不过他此刻在伦敦呢……等他回来的时候，我早就远走高飞了……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”奇洛懒洋洋地说，一边转到魔镜后面去查看，“他那时候已经盯上我了，想要知道我究竟进行到了什么地步。他一直在怀疑我。他想吓唬我——其实他哪里吓得住我，有伏地魔做我的靠山呢……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. "I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it… Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me." Quirrell shivered suddenly. "He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me… decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不论我走到哪里，他都跟我在一起，”奇洛平静地说道，“我是在环游世界时遇到他的。我当时还是一个傻乎乎的小伙子，对善恶是非有着一套荒唐的想法。是伏地魔指出了我的错误。世界上没有什么善恶是非，只有权力，还有那些无法获取权势的无能之辈……从那以后，我就忠心耿耿地为他效劳，不过我也有许多次令他失望过。他对我一直非常严厉。”奇洛突然颤抖了一下。“他从不轻易原谅我的错误。当我没能把魔法石从古灵阁偷出来时，他非常不高兴。他惩罚了我……并决定从此更加密切地监视我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“此时此刻我心里最大的愿望，”他想，“就是赶在奇洛之前我到魔法石。所以，如果我对着魔镜照一照，就应该看见自己找到了那块石头——这就意味着我能看到石头藏在哪里！可是，我怎样才能在不被奇洛发现的情况下，过去照一照魔镜呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他试着悄悄向左边移动，想趁奇洛不注意挪到镜子前面。可是，缠住他脚踝的绳索实在太紧了，他绊了一下，摔倒在地。奇洛没有理睬他，还在那里自言自语：“这面镜子是怎么回事？它究竟有什么功能？帮帮我吧，主人！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn't have everything in life.</div>
