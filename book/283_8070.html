<div class="line_en">The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father, was felicity to it. There, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart. She hoped no one could have said to her, "How could you be so unfeeling to your father? -- I must, I will tell you truths while I can." Miss Bates should never again-no, never! If attention, in future, could do away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss, her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in while she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers. Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking. She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my dear, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are! -- I suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me --(twinkling away a tear or two) -- but it will be very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful headach just now, writing all the morning: -- such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself' -- for tears were in her eyes perpetually. One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate-such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out-do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune --(again dispersing her tears) -- but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you-she is not able-she is gone into her own room -- I want her to lie down upon the bed. `My dear,' said I, `I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:' but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door-I was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle-for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.' `Well,' said she, `it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.' But then Patty came in, and said it was you. `Oh!' said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her.' -- `I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you waiting-and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and solicitude-sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible. "It must be a severe trial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."</div>

It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her; she would wait -- and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least idea! -- Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she had come to the resolution of accepting it. -- I did not know a word of it till it was all settled."</div>

It was before tea-stay-no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going to cards-and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking-Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints -- I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是呀，简说他们一定会感到难过的。可是那么好的人家，她又觉得不该拒绝。她第一次把她对埃尔顿太太说的话告诉我的时候，恰好赶上埃尔顿太太跑向我道喜，我真是大吃一惊！那是在吃茶点以前——慢着——不，不可能是在吃茶点以前，因为我们正要打牌——不过，还是在吃茶点以前，因为我记得我在想——哦！不，现在我想起来了，现在我记起来了。吃茶点以前是发生了一件事，可不是这件事。吃茶点以前，埃尔顿先生给叫到屋子外面，老约翰·阿布迪的儿子有话要对他说。可怜的老约翰，我很尊重他，他给我可怜的父亲当了二十七年文书。那老头好可怜，如今卧床不起了，患了严重的关节痛风病——我今天得去看看他。简要是出得了门，我敢肯定她也会去的。可怜的约翰的儿子来找埃尔顿先生谈谈教区救济问题。你知道，他在克朗旅店当领班、马夫之类的差事，自己的日子过得还不错，但是没有救济，还养不活他父亲。所以，埃尔顿先生回来的时候，把马夫约翰对他说的话告诉了我们，然后就说起派车去兰多尔斯把弗兰克·邱吉尔先生送到里士满。这是吃茶点以前的事。简是在吃完茶点以后才跟埃尔顿太太说的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛她一点也不了解这件事，可贝茨小姐简直不给她插话的工夫。她没想到爱玛对弗兰克·邱吉尔离开的详情会一无所知，但还是把一切都讲了出来，尽避这是无关紧要的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill -- which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃尔顿先生从马夫那儿听说的，既有马夫亲眼所见的情况，又有从兰多尔斯的仆人那儿打听来的消息，概括起来是说：游博克斯山的人回以后，从里士满来了一个送信的人——可以料想得到是哪个人来送信的；邱吉尔先生给他外甥写来一封短信，大致内容是说邱吉尔太太身体还可以，但希望他最迟明天清晨要赶回；但弗兰克—邱吉尔先生决定立即回家，不想再等，而他的马似乎着了凉，便立刻派汤姆去叫克朗旅店的马车，马夫站在外面，看见马车驶过，马夫赶得飞快，但车子驾得很稳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become of that? -- Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now. -- `You must go,' said she. `You and I must part. You will have no business here. -- Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.' -- And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter's."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，我知道你在想什么了，在想钢琴。那玩意儿该怎么办呢？的确是呀。可怜的简刚才还在说钢琴呢。‘你得走了，’她。‘你得跟我分手了。你在这儿没什么用了。不过，就放在这儿吧，’她说。‘摆在放东西的房间里，等坎贝尔上校回来了再说。我要跟他谈谈，他会为我安排的。我有什么困难，他都会帮我解决的。’我相信，直到今天，她还不知道这钢琴究竟是他送的，还是他女儿送的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一，爱玛也不得不想起了钢琴。想起自己以前无端地胡乱猜测，感到心里很不是滋味，过了不久，她觉得自己坐的时间够长了，就硬着头皮把真正想说的祝愿话又说了一遍，随即便告辞了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the other nothing-and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里面既没有令人惊异的地方，也没有让人感兴趣的地方，所以还能引起爱玛的关注，只不过因为它牵扯到她脑子里想的那件事。邱吉尔太太和简·费尔法克斯小姐之间地位之悬殊，使她感慨不已：一个主宰一切，一个却微不足道——她坐在那儿默默思索女人命运的差异，全然不知道自己的眼睛望着什么地方，后还是听见贝茨小姐说话，才回过神来。">查看中文翻译</div>
