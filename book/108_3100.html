<div class="line_en">She had a golden brooch pinned to her dress, in which the sunlight reflected hypnotically through the train window. It was half past six in the morning, Ove had just clocked off his shift and was actually supposed to be taking the train home the other way. But then he saw her on the platform with all her rich auburn hair and her blue eyes and all her effervescent laughter. And he got back on the outbound train. Of course, he didn't quite know himself why he was doing it. He had never been spontaneous before in his life. But when he saw her it was as if something malfunctioned.</div>

<div class="line_en">He convinced one of the conductors to lend him his spare pair of trousers and shirt, so he didn't have to look like a train cleaner, and then Ove went to sit by Sonja. It was the single best decision he would ever make.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说服一个乘务员借给他一身便服，这样就看不出他是个清洁工了，然后欧维走上前坐在了索雅身边。这是他一生中最出色的决定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't know what he was going to say. But he had hardly had time to sink into the seat before she turned to him cheerfully, smiled warmly, and said hello. And he found he was able to say hello back to her without any significant complications. And when she saw that he was looking at the pile of books she had in her lap, she tilted them slightly so he could read their titles. Ove understood only about half the words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他并不知道该说什么，但这并不成问题。还没等他坐稳，她就愉快地转身面对他，温柔地笑着说了声“你好”。于是他很自然地回了一句“你好”，一点都不牵强。当她看到他的目光落在她膝盖间那堆书上的时候，她热情地把它们举了起来，好让他看清书名。欧维只看明白其中一半单词。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You like reading?" she asked him brightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你喜欢读书吗？”她兴奋地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove shook his head with some insecurity, but it didn't seem to concern her very much. She just smiled, said that she loved books more than anything, and started telling him excitedly what each of the ones in her lap was about. And Ove realized that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维迟疑地摇摇头，但这好像并没有影响她的情绪。“我太爱读书了！”她说，然后就开始讲述膝盖上所有那些书的内容。欧维意识到，他愿意用余生来倾听她诉说她所热爱的那些事物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never heard anything quite as amazing as that voice. She talked as if she were continuously on the verge of breaking into giggles. And when she giggled she sounded the way Ove imagined champagne bubbles would have sounded if they were capable of laughter. He didn't quite know what he should say to avoid seeming uneducated and stupid, but it proved to be less of a problem than he had thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从没听过如此动人的声音。她说话的样子就像随时都会笑出声。而她笑出声的时候，欧维觉得那笑声像是香槟泡沫发出的声音。他不知道自己该说些什么才不会显得无知而愚蠢，但这个问题显然没有他预料的那么严重。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many years later she told him that she had found him quite puzzling when he came to sit with her in that compartment. Abrupt and blunt in his whole being. But his shoulders were broad and his arms so muscular that they stretched the fabric of his shirt. And he had kind eyes. He listened when she talked, and she liked making him smile. Anyway, the journey to school was so boring that it was pleasant just to have some company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年以后，她告诉他，她其实觉得他那天在车厢里坐到她身边是件极不寻常的事。他的出现唐突而冒昧，但他有着宽阔的肩膀和坚实的胳膊，把衬衣撑得鼓鼓的。还有温柔的眼神。他倾听她说话，她喜欢逗他发笑。另外，每天早上上学的旅程太漫长，有人做伴怎么说都是让人愉快的补偿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She liked talking and Ove liked keeping quiet. Retrospectively, Ove assumed that was what people meant when they said that people were compatible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喜欢说话，而欧维喜欢沉默。欧维后来猜测，这就是大家所谓的互补。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So maybe we'll see each other on the train going back as well. I go home at five…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我们大概可以在回程的火车上再见喽。我五点回家！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm doing my military service over there," he said, waving vaguely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在那儿当兵。”他说着，模棱两可地挥手一指。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove decided that this was undoubtedly very impractical in many ways. But there was not a lot to be done about it. So he turned around, found a signpost pointing the way to the little center of the tiny student town where he now found himself, at least a two-hour journey from his home. And then he started walking. After forty-five minutes he asked his way to the only tailor in the area, and, after eventually finding the shop, ponderously stepped inside to ask whether it would be possible to have a shirt ironed and a pair of trousers pressed and, if so, how long it would take. "Ten minutes, if you wait," came his answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维知道这一切都很不切实际，但现在又有什么关系。于是他转过身，在一块指示牌上找到他所在的这座学生城——离他家起码两小时车程——中心区域的方向。朝着这个方向迈开脚步，一路走一路问，四十分钟后，他来到学生城里唯一的一家裁缝店跟前，从容地进了门，问那儿能不能熨烫衬衣和裤子，可以的话需要多长时间。“十分钟，要是你愿意等一等的话。”店主回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was studying to be a teacher. Came on the train every day; after a couple miles she changed to another train, then a bus. All in all, it was a one-and-a-half-hour journey in the wrong direction for Ove. Only when they crossed the platform that first time, side by side, and stood by her bus stop, did she ask what he was doing there. And when Ove realized that he was only five or so kilometers from the military barracks where he would have been had it not been for that problem with his heart, the words slipped out of him before he understood why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她学师范专业。每天早上坐火车，几英里后换一列，最后换公车。总而言之，在欧维的反方向上坐一个半小时，直到他们第一次肩并肩走下火车站台，站在她等公交车的车站时，她才开口问他是做什么的。当欧维意识到，要不是因为心脏问题，他已经住到半里地外的军营里时，他不假思索地脱口而出：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove couldn't think of anything to say. He knew, of course, that one does not go home from military installations at five o'clock, but she clearly did not. So he just shrugged. And then she got on her bus and was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维没有回答。他知道当兵的人不可能五点回家，但显然她不知道。于是他只是耸耸肩，然后她就上车离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove did the same thing every day for three months. In the end she grew tired of his never inviting her out for dinner. So she invited herself instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，连续三个月欧维都做着同样的事。他从来没有开口约她吃饭，最后她终于再也忍不住，决定亲自开口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then I'll be back at four," said Ove and left. He wandered back down to the train station and lay down on a bench in the waiting hall. At quarter past three he went all the way back to the tailor's, had his shirt and trousers pressed while he sat waiting in his underwear in the staff restroom, then walked back to the station and took the train with her for an hour and a half back to her station. And then traveled for another half hour to his own station. He repeated the whole thing the day after. And the day after that. On the following day the man from the ticket desk at the train station intervened and made it clear to Ove that he couldn't sleep here like some loafer, surely he could understand that? Ove saw the point he was making, but explained that there was a woman at stake here. When he heard this, the man from the ticket desk gave him a little nod and from then on let him sleep in the left-luggage room. Even men at train station ticket desks have been in love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我四点来。”欧维说着转身离开。他原路走回火车站，在候车室的一条长凳上躺下睡了一觉。三点一刻，他又按原路走回裁缝店，裁缝熨衬衣和裤子的时候，他就穿着内裤坐在员工厕所里等，之后又原路走回火车站，与她一起坐了一个半小时火车回到他自己的车站。第二天，他又照做了一遍。第三天也是。第四天，火车站的管理员跑来告诉欧维：他不能像个流浪汉似的在这儿睡觉，希望他能理解。欧维向那人表示他非常理解，但这关系到一个女人。火车站管理员点点头，让他从此以后去行李寄存处睡觉。毕竟，火车站管理员也谈过恋爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是就有了他们的第一次约会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll be waiting here tomorrow evening at eight o'clock. I want you to be wearing a suit and I'd like you to invite me out for dinner," she said succinctly as she stepped off the train one Friday evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“明天晚上八点整，我在这儿等你。我要你穿上西装带我去饭馆。”一个周五的晚上，她下车后直截了当地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从来没人问过欧维遇见她之前他是怎么生活的。但要是有人问起，他一定会回答说自己没有生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you meeting someone?" she asked, pleased to see him coming down the stairs. She had never seen him wearing a suit. Ove nodded gruffly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有约会？”他下楼时，阿姨激动地问。她从未见过他穿西装。欧维严肃地点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Saturday evening he put on his father's old brown suit. It was tight around his shoulders. Then he ate two sausages and seven potatoes, which he prepared in the little kitchenette in his room, before doing his rounds of the house to put in a couple of screws, which the old lady had asked him to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="周六晚上，他穿上了父亲的棕色旧西服。肩膀处有些紧。然后，他吃了两根香肠、七个土豆，都是用他那房间里的小灶台烧的，又在房子里四处转悠，弄好了那些阿姨让他修一修的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The older woman nodded and probably tried to hide a little smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老妇人点点头，强忍着笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove inhaled again and nodded curtly. When he was at the door, she called out from the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维又吸了口气，轻轻点点头。他站到门口的时候，阿姨突然从厨房里激动地喊：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perplexed, Ove stuck his head around the partition wall and stared at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维不明就里地从隔墙背后探过头来，盯着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She'd probably like some flowers," the old woman declared with some emphasis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她一定会喜欢花。”阿姨煞有介事地强调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Flowers, Ove!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“花，欧维！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove cleared his throat and closed the front door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维咳嗽一声，关上大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For more than fifteen minutes he stood waiting for her at the station in his tight-fitting suit and his new-polished shoes. He was skeptical about people who came late. "If you can't depend on someone being on time, you shouldn't trust 'em with anything more important either," he used to mutter when people came dribbling along with their time cards three or four minutes late, as if this didn't matter. As if the railway line would just lie there waiting for them in the morning and not have something better to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他穿着那件紧身棕色西服和那双新擦亮的皮鞋，站在火车站旁，等了足足一刻钟。他对迟到的人总是心存怀疑。欧维的父亲常说不要相信总是迟到的人。“如果守时都做不到，你还能指望他做什么更重要的事情？”在铁道上班的时候，当那些大摇大摆迟到个三四分钟打卡的人若无其事地经过时，他总是这么说。就好像铁道没别的什么正经事可做，每天早上都会在那等他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So for each of those fifteen minutes that Ove stood waiting at the station he was slightly irritated. And then the irritation turned into a certain anxiety, and after that he decided that Sonja had only been ribbing him when she'd suggested they should meet. He had never felt so silly in his entire life. Of course she didn't want to go out with him, how could he have got that into his head? His humiliation, when the insight dawned on him, welled up like a stream of lava, and he was tempted to toss the flowers in the nearest trash can and march off without turning around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以欧维在火车站等候的那十五分钟，每一分钟都让他有些恼火。然后恼怒渐渐转化成焦虑，他开始确信索雅只是在耍他。他一生从没像现在这样觉得自己好傻，她当然不想和他约会，他想什么呢？这个念头一旦扎了根，羞愧就如同熔岩一般在他心里往上涌，他好想把花往最近的垃圾箱里一扔，头也不回地离开这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking back, he couldn't quite explain why he stayed. Maybe because he felt, in spite of it all, that an agreement to meet was an agreement. And maybe there was some other reason.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事后他也无法解释究竟是什么让他留了下来。或许他觉得约定就是约定，也或许是出于别的原因，说不清道不明的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The woman at the florist's had asked him what he wanted. He informed her gruffly that this was a bit of a bloody question to ask. After all, she was the one who sold the greens and he the one who bought them, not the other way around. The woman had looked a bit bothered about that, but then she asked if the recipient of the flowers had some favorite color, perhaps? "Pink," Ove had said with great certainty, although he did not know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="花店里的女人问过他“想要什么”。他说这算什么该死的问题。话说她才是那个卖花的，而他是买花的，而不是相反。女人对这话有些反感，但最后还是问收花的人对颜色有没有什么偏好。“粉红色。”欧维确凿地回答，但其实他并不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something a little harder to put his finger on. He didn't know it at that moment, of course, but he was destined to spend so many quarter hours of his life waiting for her that his old father would have gone cross-eyed if he'd found out. And when she did finally turn up, in a long floral-print skirt and a cardigan so red that it made Ove shift his weight from his right foot to his left, he decided that maybe her inability to be on time was not the most important thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他当时当然不知道，他的一生将有多少个一刻钟要用来等待她，要是他父亲知道了，一定会气坏的。但当她身着一条印花长裙和一件红得让欧维不得不挪动一下脚步的羊毛衫出现时，欧维当即决定，她不守时的毛病也可以原谅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They're absolutely beautiful," she said, smiling in that candid way that made Ove stare down at the ground and kick at the gravel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们真美。”她真诚的笑声让欧维忍不住低下头去踹一脚砾石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove wasn't much for restaurants. He had never understood why one would ever eat out for a lot of money when one could eat at home. He wasn't so taken with show-off furniture and elaborate cooking, and he was very much aware of his conversational shortcomings as well. Whatever the case, he had eaten in advance so he could afford to let her order whatever she wanted from the menu, while opting for the cheapest dish for himself. And at least if she asked him something he wouldn't have his mouth full of food. To him it seemed like a good plan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维对下馆子一点都不在行。他从来都不理解，明明可以在家吃饭，人们为什么还要花大把的钱上饭店。他对高档家具和美味佳肴一窍不通，而且他完全明白自己对交谈这档子事也一样。但现在这种情况下，他想，既然他已经垫了肚子，不管怎么样他都能让她先点餐，然后从菜单上点个最便宜的菜。这样的话，她要是向他提问，至少他不用满嘴食物无言以对。他觉得这是个好主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now she stood outside the station with his flowers pressed happily to her breast, in that red cardigan of hers, making the rest of the world look as if it were made in grayscale.</div>

<div class="line_en">While she was ordering, the waiter smiled ingratiatingly. Ove knew all too well what both he and the other diners in the restaurant had thought when they came in. She was too good for Ove, that's what they'd thought. And Ove felt very silly about that. Mostly because he entirely agreed with their opinion.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," he mumbled, shamefaced, and kicked his chair leg a little, before adding in such a low voice that it could hardly even be heard: "I just wanted to know what it felt like to be someone you look at." As he was getting up she reached across the table and put her hand on his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起。”他羞愧地嘀咕着，轻踹着椅子腿，直到终于蹦出几个几乎难以识别的词来：“我只是想知道做你的眼中人是什么感觉。”他站起身时，她伸过手来放在他的手背上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She told him with great animation about her studies, about books she'd read or films she'd seen. And when she looked at Ove she made him feel, for the first time, that he was the only man in the world. And Ove had enough integrity to realize that this wasn't right, that he couldn't sit here lying any longer. So he cleared his throat, collected his faculties, and told her the whole truth. That he wasn't doing his military service at all, that in fact he was just a simple cleaner on the trains who had a defective heart and who had lied for no other reason than that he enjoyed riding with her on the train so very much. He assumed this would be the only dinner he ever had with her, and he did not think she deserved having it with a fraudster. When he had finished his story he put his napkin on the table and got out his wallet to pay.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove had hardly been as discreet as a Russian spy, she added. She'd come to the conclusion that he had his reasons for it. And she'd liked the way he listened to her. And made her laugh. And that, she said, had been more than enough for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么说吧，欧维没俄罗斯间谍那么谨慎，伪装得不够好，她补充说。但她估计他一定有自己的理由。她喜欢他倾听自己说话的样子，也喜欢逗他笑。她说，对于她，这就足够了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she asked him what he really wanted to do with his life, if he could choose anything he wanted.

And then she didn't start laughing as he thought she would. She got angry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她问他这辈子到底想做些什么，有没有什么梦想，无论是什么。而他不假思索地回答说想要造房子。设计构造，画图纸，计算出使之屹立不倒的最好方法。这下，她没有像他以为的那样笑起来，她火了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他叨咕着什么：不行，现在这样或许挺好，但这改变不了事实。他就是个骗子。但她求他坐下的时候，他还是一屁股坐回了椅子上。她没有像他以为的那样生气，反而笑了起来。最后她说，其实识破他一点都不难：他从来不穿军装。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he came up to his room she was sitting on his bed. Ove stood sulkily in the doorway, with his hands in his pockets. She looked at him and laughed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are we an item now?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们算在一起了吗？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove did not have a particularly good answer to that one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这问题欧维一时半会儿真找不到好答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the following Monday she came to his house with brochures for a correspondence course leading to an engineering qualification. The old landlady was quite overwhelmed when she looked at the beautiful young woman walking up the stairs with self-confident steps. Later she tapped Ove's back and whispered that those flowers were probably a very good investment. Ove couldn't help but agree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="周一，她带了几本工程学位函授课程的宣传册到他家。和欧维住在同一套房子里的老阿姨无比惊讶地看着眼前这个美丽的年轻女子迈着自信的脚步走上楼梯。然后她拍拍欧维的背，说他买的那些花真是世界上最值当的投资。欧维也不得不同意这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But why don't you do it, then?" she demanded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你为什么不去做？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, yes," he replied hesitantly, "I suppose it could be that way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，可以这么说吧。”他回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She handed him the brochures. It was a two-year course, and it proved that all the time Ove had spent learning about house building had not, after all, been wasted as he'd once believed. Maybe he did not have much of a head for studying in a conventional sense, but he understood numbers and he understood houses. That got him far. He took the examination after six months. Then another. And another. Then he got a job at the housing office and stayed there for more than a third of a century. Worked hard, was never ill, paid his mortgage, paid taxes, did his duty. Bought a little two-story row house in a recently constructed development in the forest. She wanted to get married, so Ove proposed. She wanted children, which was fine with him, said Ove. And their understanding was that children should live in row housing developments among other children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把宣传册递给他。课程需要两年时间，事实证明，欧维曾学到的关于房子的一切可能并没像他以为的那样荒废掉。或许他并不是一个传统意义上的好学生，但他理解数字，还了解房子，这就够了。六个月后，他通过一门考试。之后又是一门。然后还有一门。这之后他在建筑工程公司找了份工作，一干就是三分之一个世纪。工作努力，从无病假，还贷缴税，自食其力。还在郊外的树林里买了一栋新建成的联排别墅。她想结婚，欧维就求婚。她想要孩子，孩子可以有，欧维想，要住在联排别墅区内，和别的孩子一起，这个他们知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And less than forty years later there was no forest around the house anymore. Just other houses. And one day she was lying there in a hospital and holding his hand and telling him not to worry. Everything was going to be all right. Easy for her to say, thought Ove, his breast pulsating with anger and sorrow. But she just whispered, "Everything will be fine, darling Ove," and leaned her arm against his arm. And then gently pushed her index finger into the palm of his hand. And then closed her eyes and died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到四十年之后，房子周围已经没有什么树林，只有其他房子。一天她躺在医院的病床上握着他的手，让他不要难过。一切都会好起来。她说起来容易，欧维想，胸口满是愤怒和悲伤。但她只是把头靠在他的胳膊上，喃喃地说“一切都会好的，亲爱的欧维”。然后小心翼翼地把食指裹进他的掌心，慢慢闭上眼睛，离开了这个世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove stayed there with her hand in his for several hours. Until the hospital staff entered the room with warm voices and careful movements, explaining that they had to take her body away. Ove rose from his chair, nodded, and went to the undertakers to take care of the paperwork. On Sunday she was buried. On Monday he went to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维握着她的手坐了几个钟头，直到医院的工作人员跑来，温和而谨慎地向他解释，他们必须抬走她的尸体。于是欧维从椅子上站起来，自顾点点头，去殡仪馆填了些表格。周日是她的葬礼。周一他按时上了班。">查看中文翻译</div>
