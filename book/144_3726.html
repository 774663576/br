<div class="line_en">Lia Vazzi, For the first time, deliberately disobeyed the order of his boss, Cross De Lena. It was unavoidable. Detective Jim Losey had made another visit to the Hunting Lodge and had again asked questions about Skannet's death. Lia denied all knowledge of Skannet and claimed he had just happened to be in the hotel lobby at that particular time. Losey patted him on the shoulder, then lightly slapped him across the face. "OK, you little guinea prick," he said, "I'll get you soon."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lia remembered driving Cross to the meeting with Phil Sharkey, Losey's retired partner. He had never believed that Sharkey would remain quiet on the promise of a future fifty grand. Now he was sure that Sharkey had informed Losey of that meeting and probably had seen Vazzi waiting in the car. If this was true, there would be a great danger to Cross and himself. In essence he distrusted the judgment of Cross, police officers stuck together like Mafioso. They had their own kind of omerta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚回忆起驾车送克罗斯去见菲尔·沙尔基的事，那是洛西已经退休的搭档。他从来不信沙尔基会为了将来的五万美元就恪守承诺保持沉默。现在他确信了，沙尔基肯定把那场会见告诉了洛西，而且可能把看见瓦齐坐在车里的事也说了。这要是真的，克罗斯和他就很危险了。说实话，他不信克罗斯的判断，警察就和黑手党一样，非常团结。他们有他们自己的缄默规则。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his mind Lia signed a death warrant for Losey. No matter what else happened, and he knew his future was in peril, he would make sure of Losey's fate. But he had to be very careful. The Clericuzio Family had strict rules. You never harmed a police officer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚在心里已经为洛西签了一张死刑执行令。不管发生什么事，只要他知道自己的未来有危险，就一定要洛西死。但他得非常小心。克莱里库齐奥家族有着严格的规矩，绝对不能伤害警察。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The outside of Sharkey's house was deserted, the lawn empty except for an abandoned mower. But the garage door was open, a car in it, and Lia walked up the cement path to the door and rang the bell. There was no answer. He kept ringing. He tested the knob, the door was not locked, now there was a choice to be made. Did he go in or leave immediately? He wiped his prints off the knob and bell with the tail of his tie. Then he went through the door into the small hallway and called Sharkey's name in a shout. There was no answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙尔基的住处附近人迹罕至，草坪空空荡荡，只剩下一台废弃的刈草机。但是车库门开着，里面停着一辆车，利亚沿着水泥道路走到门口，按响门铃，却无人应答，他继续按铃，然后试了试门把，发现门没锁。现在得做个选择，是进屋还是直接离开呢？他用领带下摆擦净把手和门铃上自己的指纹，然后进门，在短短的门廊里喊沙尔基的名字，却没有人应答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lia recruited two of his soldiers to drive him down from the Hunting Lodge to Santa Monica, the home of Phil Sharkey. He was confident that just by talking to Sharkey he would know if the man had informed Losey of the visit by Cross.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚征募了两个手下，开车把他从猎场送去圣莫尼卡市，那是菲尔·沙尔基的住处。他有自信，只要和沙尔基聊上两句，就能知道这家伙有没有把克罗斯拜访的事情告诉洛西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lia moved through the house; the two bedrooms were bare, he looked into the closets and under the beds. He went through the living room, looking under the sofa and through the cushions. Then he went into the kitchen and to the patio table where there was a container of milk and a paper plate that held a partially eaten cheese sandwich, white bread with dehydrated yellow mayo on the edges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚穿过屋子：两间卧室里什么也没有，他还看了看衣柜里和床底下。他穿过起居室，检查了沙发底下和窗帘后。然后他走进厨房，露台桌上有一盒牛奶和一个纸盘子，盘子上盛着吃过几口的奶酪三明治，三明治的白面包皮子边上蘸着脱水的黄色蛋黄酱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lia Vazzi descended the two steps and looked behind a mound of used bicycles. He opened a closet with huge doors. In it was a policeman's uniform hanging all by itself, on the floor was a pair of thick black shoes, and resting on the shoes was a braided street policeman's cap. That was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚·瓦齐走下两步台阶，房间里有一堆用过的自行车，利亚瞅了瞅这堆自行车后面。他打开一只衣柜巨大的柜门，里面只挂着一套警察制服，地上摆着一双厚实的黑皮鞋，鞋子上搁着一顶镶着穗带的街警帽。此外无他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lia went back up the stairs and stood on the patio staring at the ocean. Burying a body in the sand was foolhardy, so he dismissed the idea. Maybe somebody had come by and picked Sharkey up. But for an assassin there would be a risk of being seen. Also, Sharkey would be a dangerous man to kill. So, Lia reasoned, if the man was dead he had to be in this house. Immediately he went back down to the basement and threw all the wool blankets out of the trunk. And sure enough, there at the bottom was first the large head, and then the lean body. There was a hole in Sharkey's right eye and over it a thin cake of blood like a red coin. The facial skin, waxy with long death, was pockmarked with black dots. Lia, as a Qualified Man, knew exactly what that meant. Someone trusted had been allowed to come very close to shoot point blank into the eye; those dots were powder marks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚走回厨房，站在露台上盯着大海。把尸体埋进沙滩里是件蠢事，于是他放弃了这个想法。也许谁来把沙尔基带走了呢？但是这样的话可能被人看见，刺杀就有风险。而且沙尔基也不是容易杀的人。所以利亚推理出，如果有人死了，尸体肯定在屋子里。他立即回到半下沉房间，把箱子里的毛毯统统丢开。果然，箱子底部先是一颗硕大的头颅，下面连着瘦削的身子。沙尔基的右眼上有一个洞眼，上面盖着一层薄薄的血痂，像是一枚红色硬币。因为死亡时间长，尸体脸色苍白，脸上还布满了黑点。利亚作为一个中选者，清楚地知道这意味着什么。某个沙尔基深信不疑的人在离沙尔基非常近的地方开枪射击，打中他的眼睛；那些黑点都是火药粉痕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a slatted brown door in the kitchen, and Lia opened it to reveal a shallow basement only two wooden steps down, sort of a dropped room with no windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨房里有一扇褐色的板条门，利亚打开门，发现门后的房间地势略低，走下两个木板台阶就到底了，算是一个没窗户的半下沉房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lia went to the one trunk on the floor and pulled up the lid. It was surprisingly light. The interior was filled to the top with neatly folded gray blankets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carefully, Lia folded the blankets, put them back over the body, and then exited the house. He had not left any fingerprints but was aware that fragments of the blankets must have adhered to his clothing. He would have to destroy the clothes thoroughly. His shoes, too. He had his soldiers drive him to the airport, and while he was waiting for a plane to take him to Vegas, he bought a change of clothing including new shoes in one of the stores in the airport mall. Then he bought a carry-on bag and put his old clothes into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚小心翼翼地把毯子重新码好，盖住尸体，然后退出屋子。他在现场没留下一点指纹，但他知道毯子上的毛肯定沾到自己身上了。他必须彻底销毁这些衣服，还有他的鞋子。他让手下开车送他去机场，打算乘坐班机飞往维加斯，候机的时候，他在机场商场的一家店里买下一套替换衣物，包括鞋子。之后他还买了一个可以随身携带的包裹，把旧衣服丢了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Vegas he checked into the Xanadu and left a message for Cross. Then he showered thoroughly and dressed again in his new clothes. He waited for Cross to call.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross looked at him and smiled. Lia, usually a natty dresser, had bought a flowery shirt, blue canvas pants, and a light jacket, also blue. He looked like a low-caste casino hustler.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯看着他，嘴角泛起了微笑。利亚一向衣着得体，但这次他穿着花里胡哨的衬衫，蓝色帆布裤，还有同样是蓝色的薄外套，看上去就像是一个不上场面的赌场老千。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Simple," Lia said. "Sharkey was the only one who could tie Losey with Dante. Otherwise it's just your say-so. Dante made Losey kill his partner."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lia told him about Sharkey. He attempted to make excuses for his actions, but Cross dismissed them. "You're in this with me, you have to protect yourself. But what the hell does this mean?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Lia shrugged. "He figured he could get money from Losey and then get the fifty from you anyway. He knew that Losey must be playing for big stakes because of the money you gave him. After all, he was a detective for twenty years, he could figure these things out. And he never dreamed Losey would kill him, his old partner. He didn't figure on Dante."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利亚耸肩。“他觉得自己可以从洛西手上拿到钱，然后不管怎样，还能再从你这儿拿五万。他知道你能给出那么多钱，毕竟他也当了二十年的探员，能够把这些都想明白。而且他做梦也想不到，洛西会杀他，他可是他的老搭档啊。但他算漏了丹特。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Cross exercised by shooting a lone eighteen holes of golf, with Lia accompanying him to drive the golf cart. Lia could not understand the popularity of golf in all the Families. To him it was a quaint aberration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后的三天，利亚都在和克罗斯商议计划。那期间他用酒店的焚烧炉亲手把自己的旧衣服烧了。克罗斯练习打十八洞的高尔夫球，利亚则开着高尔夫球车陪他。利亚想不通，高尔夫球是怎么流行在各大家族之间的。在他看来，这种运动就是旁门左道。">查看中文翻译</div>
