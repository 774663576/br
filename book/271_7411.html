<div class="line_en">Edward lurched away from me suddenly, his hand reaching out toward Carlisle. At the same time, I felt a much sharper jab against the shield where it wrapped protectively around Carlisle's light. It wasn't painful, but it wasn't pleasant, either.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“切尔西正试着冲破我们的防御，”爱德华悄悄对我说。“但是她无法发现他们。她无法获知我们在此……”他给了我一个目光。“是你阻止了她吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jane," Edward answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“简。”爱德华回答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The moment that he said her name, a dozen pointed attacks hit in a second, stabbing all over the elastic shield, aimed at twelve different bright spots. I flexed, making sure the shield was undamaged. It didn't seem like Jane had been able to pierce it. I glanced around quickly; everyone was fine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他说出她的名字时，一打的攻击点同时向着不同的目标展开攻击，意图割裂我的弹性防护罩。我绷紧了身体，确保我的防护罩不受损坏。感觉上简并没有得逞。我环视四周，所有的人看上去都很好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It probably wasn't very mature. But I figured it would take Aro about half a second to guess -- if he hadn't already -- that my shield was more powerful than Edward had known; I already had a big target on my forehead and there was really no point in trying to keep the extent of what I could do a secret. So I grinned a huge, smug smile right at Jane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可能不太确切。但是我估计这会耽误阿罗半秒钟的时间去猜测——如果他还没有这样做过的话——很明显我的守护盾的能量比爱德华印象中的更强大；我的目标如此明显，因此我所做的一切很难对他们保持神秘。于是，我露出了一个大大的笑容，讥讽的看着简。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked across at Jane, who was staring at our group with furious disbelief. I was pretty sure that, besides me, she'd never seen anyone remain standing through her fiery assault.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="简发出尖利的咆哮。所有的人都惊跳起来，包括那些训练有素的守卫。但是那些长老们不在其中，他们仍在专心致志的投票表决。简的孪生兄弟抓住了她的胳膊，阻止她弓下身子起跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I waited for some pressure, some sign of his attack, but I felt nothing. He continued to stare in our direction, his pretty face composed. Was he attacking? Was he getting through my shield? Was I the only one who could still see him? I clutched at Edward's hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我等待着他攻击的能量，但是，我什么都感觉不到。他继续盯着我们的方向，完美的脸上表情十分镇定。他攻击了吗？他穿透了我的守护盾了吗？难道我是唯一能看到他的人？我不由握紧爱德华的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A strange clear haze was oozing across the snow, nearly invisible against the white. It reminded me of a mirage -- a slight warping of the view, a hint of a shimmer. I pushed my shield out from Carlisle and the rest of the front line, afraid to have the slinking mist too close when it hit. What if it stole right through my intangible protection? Should we run?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一片奇怪的迷蒙的烟雾穿过雪地，几乎与白雪融为一体。这是我联想起海市蜃楼——有点扭曲，闪着不怀好意的暗光。我更用力的撑起我的守护盾，使它将卡莱尔和前排的其他人笼罩在内，一面担心如果这层迷雾偷偷溜进我那不可预知的防护罩该怎么办，我们要逃跑吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A low rumbling murmured through the ground under our feet, and a gust of wind blew the snow into sudden flurries between our position and the Volturi's. Benjamin had seen the creeping threat, too, and now he tried to blow the mist away from us. The snow made it easy to see where he threw the wind, but the mist didn't react in any way. It was like air blowing harmlessly through a shadow; the shadow was immune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵低沉轰鸣从我们脚下的地面滚滚涌过，狂风卷起积雪，在我们和沃尔图里之间的半空中骤然落下。本杰明也发现了潜行的威胁，现在他正试着将那片薄雾驱散。飘扬的积雪使我们能够看清楚风的方向，但是那团迷雾没有受到影响。就像一阵强风吹袭影子，而影子不会受到任何伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The triangular formation of the ancients finally broke apart when, with a racking groan, a deep, narrow fissure opened in a long zigzag across the middle of the clearing. The earth rocked under my feet for a moment. The drifts of snow plummeted into the hole, but the mist skipped right across it, as untouched by gravity as it had been by wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沃尔图里长老们的讨论结束了，分散开来。伴随着一声痛苦的的抱怨，一道深而狭长的裂缝，蜿蜒着出现在空地中央。我们脚下的大地在颤动。积雪立即坠入沟中，但是那团迷雾似乎根本不会受到重力的作用，就像刚才不受风的影响一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I analyzed their expressions as Aro turned back to us. His face was as benign as ever, but unlike before, I sensed a strange blankness behind the facade. As if his scheming was over. Caius was clearly incensed, but his rage was turned inward now; he was resigned. Marcus looked… bored; there really was no other word for it. The guard was impassive and disciplined again; there were no individuals among them, just the whole. They were in formation, ready to depart. The Volturi witnesses were still wary; one after another, they departed, scattering into the woods. As their numbers dwindled, the remaining sped up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注视着他们的一举一动。阿罗转过身来面对我们。他的表情像从前一样温和，但也不是刚才的样子，我能感觉到一种奇怪的虚无隐藏在这个面具的后面。就像是他的诡计已经终结了。卡尤斯仍然处于怒火中，但是他很好的隐藏了起来；他顺从了。而马库斯……看上去觉得更加无聊了。这一切确实让人无话可说。守卫们保持着训练有素的无动于衷的表情，没有例外，他们全体服从命令，整装待发。沃尔图里的见证人们仍然忧心忡忡，一个接一个，毫无声息的消失在树林中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aro held his hands out to us, almost apologetic. Behind him, the larger part of the guard, along with Caius, Marcus, and the silent, mysterious wives, were already drifting quickly away, their formation precise once again. Only the three that seemed to be his personal guardians lingered with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿罗向我们伸出了手，表现出最大的诚意。在他的身后，大批的守卫正追随着卡尤斯，马库斯还有那些沉默、神秘的妻子们迅速的消失在森林深处，他们的编队仍然密不透风。只有阿罗的那三名专职守卫守候在远处。">查看中文翻译</div>
