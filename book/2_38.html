<div class="line_en">Yes this may be surprising, I was only 13 years old that time. But, I don't know how or why it happened to me so early. I fell deeply in love with a guy, who I used to think was annoying 2 months ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day when I was going to school, I bumped into Ivy on the way out of my building, and she was standing next to this guy, he lived in the building right beside mine. He said "Hi" to me, and we just asked each other "how are you" and blah blah, then I had to leave. But I noticed that guy was looking at me. It was a different kind of look, look with love in his eyes. Few days later, I noticed whenever I go to school and come back from school, he is standing in his balcony, and smiling at me. If he is not around, and some of his friends see me, they start to yell out his name. Oh yeah, by the way, his name was Mamun.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was 1997, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, my family and I have just moved to a new apartment in a new area. So, after few weeks have passed, I started going back to school, since it was during Ramadan we moved. Well, I made some new friends in the neighborhood. This girl who was always hanging out with, her name was Ivy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1997年，在孟加拉国的吉大港，我和家人刚搬到一个新地方，住进新公寓。由于我们是在斋月搬的家，所以过了几个星期，我才重新回到学校上学。我在附近交了一些新朋友。有个女孩总和我一起出去玩，她叫艾维。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mamun did come to my roof one day to talk to me but I wanted him to go away. I didn't want anyone to see us talking. As you know, in Bangladesh rumors go around so fast. When we talked, I saw deep love in his eyes. I always smiled at him; I didn't talk to him much. Still, life was going on so wonderfully. Mamun never told me he loved me. I thought that was because, I was 5/6 years younger than him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，马蒙来到我家屋顶上跟我说话，但我想让他离开。我不想让任何人看见我们说话。你也知道，在孟加拉国流言蜚语传得很快。我们谈话时，我看到他眼神里流露出的深深的爱恋。我一直对着他微笑，并没有和他说太多话。生活照样如此奇妙地过着，马蒙从来没有告诉我他喜欢我。我想，可能是因为我比他小五六岁的原因吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once I was reading a book, and I noticed Mamun come to their roof and he looked at me, and smiled. Oh my god! I don't know what happened to me. That sweet smile just took me away. I smiled back at him, for the first time. I could never forget that moment. We used to smile at each other whenever we saw each other, but never had a chat. I was sure that he liked me a lot, because, anytime he would see me on the roof from his balcony, he came up to the roof right away. I fell in love with him very deeply. I was surprised that I did. The feelings I had was so beautiful and made me so happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，我正在看书，发现马蒙也来到他家的屋顶看着我笑。哦，天哪！真不知道我怎么了，他甜美的笑容竟然把我迷住了。我不禁也对他笑了，那是第一次对他笑，我永远不会忘记那一刻。以后我们每次看见对方的时候都相视而笑，但从来没说过话。我敢肯定他非常喜欢我，因为无论什么时候，只要他从阳台上看到我在屋顶，他就会马上跑上屋顶。我自己也很惊讶，我竟然深深地喜欢上了他。这种感觉是如此美妙，让我如此幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, I was very annoyed by those things. And I even told Ivy to tell Mamun to stop these foolishness. After my exams were over, I had a break. So I used to go to the roof and read books to spend my time. Mamun used to come to their roof also and both roofs where so close to each other that you can just jump from one to another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，我也很讨厌这些事情。我甚至让艾维转告马蒙停止这些愚蠢的行为。考试结束后，我有个短暂的假期，所以经常会去屋顶看书打发时间。马蒙也经常去他们的屋顶，两个屋顶离得很近，你甚至可以从一个跳到另一个上面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Very soon, I found out that me and my family are leaving Bangladesh and coming to Canada. I was devastated. I cried all night but there was nothing to do. When Mamun found out, he asked me on the roof, if it was true. When I said yes, he asked how long will I be in Canada. The answer was maybe forever, we were going to settle in Canada. He looked depressed, all he said was "Oh", then I told him our flight date.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，我发现我们家就要离开孟加拉国去加拿大了。我彻底心碎了。我哭了一整夜，可这也无济于事。马蒙知道后，在屋顶上问我这是不是真的。我说是，他问我在加拿大会待多久，我说可能是永远，我们打算在加拿大定居。他看起来很沮丧，只说了声“哦”，之后我告诉了他航班的日期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next month, it was Ramadan again. Mamun came to say goodbye to me on the roof, he was leaving to spend his Eid with his family. That day, I was so sad, I felt like I lost something very important in my life. We said goodbye to each other, he said he thinks I am such a sweet girl, he hopes I have a great life in Canada. Oh my god, I couldn't hold myself, I think my eyes became watery. I didn't want him to see that I was crying. I said "you too" and tried to smile and left the roof right away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下个月，又是9月斋月。马蒙来到屋顶上与我道别，他要去和他的家人过开斋节。那一天，我是那么的难过，我感到我失去了生命里十分重要的东西。我们互相道别后，他说他认为我是一个很讨人喜欢的女孩，祝愿我在加拿大生活愉快。哦，天哪！我几乎无法控制自己了，我想我的眼睛一定泪汪汪的。我不想让他看到我哭。说完“你也是”，我就试着笑起来，马上离开了屋顶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the last day I ever saw my first love. Now 4 years later, here I am in Canada. I have a guy in my life now, whom I am deeply love with after Mamun. I never lose him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是我最后一次看到我的初恋。现在我已经在加拿大生活了4年多，我也有了男朋友，他是在马蒙之后我深爱的一个人。我绝不会失去他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am over Mamun now. Everytime I remember those days, looking at each other on the roof, talking, I feel really down. I wonder where he is now, if we will even meet again, I can never forget my first love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，我和马蒙的事已经过去了。每当我回忆起那些日子，我们在屋顶上互相望着彼此聊天，我还是感觉很难受。我不知道他现在在哪儿，我们是否还能再见面，但我永远不会忘记我的初恋。">查看中文翻译</div>
