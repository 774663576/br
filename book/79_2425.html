It slashed out with the scarred hammer, its double head now shapeless and splintered with countless impacts. It struck the wall, cutting a circle in the silk paper. Plaster dust puffed out. It began to grin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，凭上帝起誓，”它喘着气叫道。它用颤抖的手擦了擦嘴唇。“现在你会明白这儿谁是老板了，你会明白的。他们要的不是你，是我，我。我！”它又把伤痕累累的木槌挥了出去，由于承受了无数次的撞击，木槌的两头已经破损得看不出原来的样子了。木槌砸在墙上，削下了一圈墙纸，扑出了一团墙灰。那东西咧嘴笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're a mask," Danny said. "Just a false face. The only reason the hotel needs to use you is that you aren't as dead as the others. But when it's done with you, you won't be anything at all. You don't scare me."</div>

You plotted against me! And you cheated! You copied that final exam!" The eyes glared out at him from beneath the furred brows. There was an expression of lunatic cunning in them. "I'll find it, too. It's down in the basement somewhere. I'll find it. They promised me I could look all I want." It raised the mallet again.</div>

Just for show, my daddy says. You're it, not my daddy. You're the hotel. And when you get what you want, you won't give my daddy anything because you're selfish. And my daddy knows that.

<div class="line_en">"Go on and hit me. But you'll never get what you want from me." The face in front of him changed. It was hard to say how; there was no melting or merging of the features. The body trembled slightly, and then the bloody hands opened like broken claws. The mallet fell from them and thumped to the rug. That was all.

<div class="line_en">Danny stood without moving. There was no place he could run where the Overlook was not. He recognized it suddenly, fully, painlessly. For the first time in his life he had an adult thought, an adult feeling, the essence of his experience in this bad place -- a sorrowful distillation: (Mommy and Daddy can't help me and I'm alone.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼一动不动地站在那里，他跑不出远望饭店的势力范围之外。他立即、完全、毫无痛苦地认识到了这一点。在他生命中第一次他产生了一个成年人的想法、成年人的感情——他在这个鬼地方获得的经验中的精华：（爸爸妈妈帮不了我，我只能靠自己。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go away," he said to the bloody stranger in front of him. "Go on. Get out of here." It bent over, exposing the knife handle in its back. Its hands closed around the mallet again, but instead of aiming at Danny, it reversed the handle, aiming the hard side of the roque mallet at its own face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走开，”他对眼前这个血淋淋的陌生人说。“快走，别呆在这儿。”它弯下腰，露出了背上的刀把。它又抓起了木槌，但不是对着丹尼，而是转过槌柄，将硬槌头对准了它自己的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the mallet began to rise and descend, destroying the last of Jack Torrance's image. The thing in the hall danced an eerie, shuffling polka, the beat counterpointed by the hideous sound of the mallet head striking again and again. Blood splattered across the wallpaper. Shards of bone leaped into the air like broken piano keys. It was impossible to say just how long it went on. But when it turned its attention back to Danny, his father was gone forever. What remained of the face became a strange, shifting composite, many faces mixed imperfectly into one. Danny saw the woman in 217; the dogman; the hungry boy -- thing that had been in the concrete ring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，木槌开始起落，摧毁了它身上的最后一点杰克·托兰斯。这个东西跳着一种古怪的曳步波尔卡舞，节拍和着木槌反复敲击出的邪恶的声音。血溅到了墙纸上，碎骨片像破碎的钢琴键一样在空中飞舞。不知道这样持续了多长时间，但是，当它的注意力回到丹尼身上时，他父亲已经永远消失了。那张脸剩下来的东西成了一种陌生的、不断变化的拼凑物，许多张面孔不完善地揉合成了一张脸。丹尼看到了217房间的女人、狗人、水泥管里的那个饥饿的儿童。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anything else to say?" it inquired. "Are you sure you wouldn't like to run? A game of tag, perhaps? All we have is time, you know. An eternity of time. Or shall we end it? Might as well. After all, we're missing the party." It grinned with broken-toothed greed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有什么要说的吗？”它问。“你真的不想逃走吗？来一场捉人游戏，怎么样？我们有的是时间，你知道，永恒的时间。或者，我们就在这里算账？这也可以。毕竟，我们快错过晚会了。”他贪婪地狞笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Masks off, then," it whispered. "No more interruptions." The mallet rose for the final time. A ticking sound filled Danny's ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，面具去掉了，”它低声说。“不会再有什么干扰了。”木槌最后一次举起来，丹尼耳朵里充满了滴答声。">查看中文翻译</div>
