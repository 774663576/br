<div class="line_en">She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.

<div class="line_en">Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</div>

<div class="line_en">The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness. -- Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.</div>

<div class="line_en">The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness, the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.</div>

<div class="line_en">How was she to bear the change? -- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.</div>

<div class="line_en">The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good; and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her children were answered most satisfactorily.

<div class="line_en">"Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father. "But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的爱玛对什么事都想得开，”做父亲的说道。“不过，奈特利先生，可怜的泰勒小姐走后，她心里真是难过极了。她以后肯定要比现在料想的更加想念泰勒小姐。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛转过头去，既想哭，又想强颜欢笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr. Knightley. "We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样好的一个伙伴，爱玛不可能不想念，”奈特利先生说道。“如果我们认为她真能不想念泰勒小姐，可就不会像现在这样喜欢她了。不过爱玛知道，这桩婚事对泰勒小姐极为有利。她知道，泰勒小姐到了这个年纪多么想要有个家，多么需要有个生活保障，能过上舒舒服服的日子。因此，爱玛主要应该为之高兴，而不是为之伤心。泰勒小姐结了这门好亲事，她的朋友个个都该为她高兴才是。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma, Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, "Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你忘了我有一件值得高兴的事，”爱玛说，“一件非常值得高兴的事——是我撮合了这桩婚事。你知道，是我四年前给他们做的媒j当时好多人都说韦斯顿先生不会再结婚了，可我却帮助促成了这件好事，而且事实证明我做对了，真使我感到欣慰极了。”奈特利先生朝她摇摇头。伍德豪斯先生亲切地说道：“哦！亲爱的，我希望你不要去做媒，不要去预言什么事，因为你说的话总是很灵验。请你不要再给人做媒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such success, you know! -- Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful -- Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我答应不给我自己做媒，爸爸，不过我还非得给别人做媒不可。这真是其乐无穷啊！你瞧这次我干得多漂亮！谁都说韦斯顿先生决不会再结婚了。哦，决不会！韦斯顿先生丧妻这么多年，仿佛一个人过得十分舒服，不是去城里做买卖，就是在这里应酬朋友，到哪儿都受人欢迎，总是那么开心。他要是喜欢热闹，一年到头也不会一个人度过一个夜晚。哦，决不会！韦斯顿先生肯定不会再结婚了。有人甚至说，他妻子临终时，他曾保证决不续娶；还有人说，他儿子和内兄不让他再婚。五花八门的胡言乱语说得一本正经，可我一句也不信。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大约四年前的一天，我和泰勒小姐在布罗德韦巷遇见了他，当时正好下起了毛毛雨，他显得十分殷勤，连忙跑到法默·米切尔家，为我们借了两把伞，于是我就打定了主意。从那时候起，我就开始筹划这件好事。亲爱的爸爸，既然我在这件事上取得了这样的成功，你总不会以为我要洗手不干了吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'" said Mr. Knightley. "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不明白你说的‘成功’是什么意思，”奈特利先生说。“成功是要经过努力的。如果过去四年中你一直在努力促成这桩婚事，那你的工夫花得值得，没有白费。这是一位年轻小姐做的一件大好事！可是，依我看来，如果你所谓的促成了这桩婚事，只是指你生出了这个念头，某一天闲着没事儿，便对自己说：‘如果韦斯顿先生肯娶泰勒小姐，我看这对泰勒小姐是件美事。’后来又不时地这么自言自语。如果真是这样，你怎么能谈得上成功呢？你的功劳在哪儿？你有什么值得骄傲的？你是侥幸猜中了，充其量只能这么说罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess? -- I pity you. -- I thought you cleverer -- for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor word 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你从未尝过侥幸猜中的甜头和喜悦吧？你让我感到可怜。我原以为你比较聪明——请听着，侥幸猜中决不仅仅靠侥幸，总还需要几分天资。至于你跟我争执的‘成功’二字，我看我也并非一点功劳也没有。你概括了两种情况——可我认为还有第三种情况——介于全然无功和一手包办之间。如果不是我鼓动韦斯顿先生常来这里，不是我给了他那么多细微的鼓励，解决了那么多细微的问题，这件事压根儿就成不了。我想你很了解哈特菲尔德，定能知道这里的奥妙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands today, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him a service."</div>
