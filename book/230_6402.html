<div class="line_en">Together they made their way to Doctor Jekyll's house. It was a wild, stormy night. To Mr Utterson the streets seemed strangely empty and lonely. The square, when they reached it, was full of wind and flying dust. The thin trees were blowing wildly, and untidy grey clouds were sailing past a pale, sickly moon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们动身去杰基尔博士的家。那是个狂风呼啸、风雨交加的晚上，厄特森先生感到街上不同寻常地空旷和孤独。到了广场附近，风沙飞扬，细细的小树猛烈地摇摆着，乱七八糟、奇形怪状的黑云飘过苍白、昏暗的月亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Changed? You're right," said Poole. "I've worked for Doctor Jekyll for twenty years. That was not my master's voice. Someone has murdered my master. Eight days ago we heard his voice for the last time. 'Dear God!' he cried -- then no more. The voice you heard just now was the voice of his muderer!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“变了？您说得没错，”普尔说，“我服侍了杰基尔博士二十年，那根本不是主人的声音，主人已经给人害死了，八天前我最后一次听见他的声音。‘哦！亲爱的主啊！’他喊了一声，然后就再没有声音了。您刚才听到的是凶手的声音！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is an extraordinary story, my good man," said Mr Utterson. He tried hard to appear calm. "If Dr Jekyll has been murdered -- why is his murderer still there? What reason could he possibly have for staying?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps you don't believe me, sir, but I know what I heard. For a week now the person or thing -- in that study has been crying night and day for some special chemical powders. My master was in the habit, when he was particularly busy with his scientific work, of writing orders on pieces of paper and leaving them on the stairs. We've had nothing else this week, nothing except written orders and a locked door. I've been to every chemist in town in search of these chemicals of his, but they were never right. They weren't pure enough, he said. I had to take them back to the shop, and try another chemist. I don't know what these chemicals are, but the person in that study wants them terribly badly."</div>

<div class="line_en">Poole reached in his pocket and brought out a note. The lawyer read it carefully. It said: "I am returning your chemicals, as they are impure and therefore useless. In the year 18xx you made up a mixture of chemical powders for Doctor Henry Jekyll. Please search your cupboards for some more of the same mixture and send it to Doctor Jekyll AT ONCE. This is VERY IMPORTANT."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes! It was like this. I came suddenly into the laboratory from the garden. I think he had left the study to look for something. The study door was open and there he was at the far end of the laboratory. He was searching among some old boxes. He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry and ran upstairs and into the study. I only saw him for a moment, but my blood seemed to freeze. Sir, if that was my master, why was he wearing a mask over his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a trapped animal and run away from me? I've been his servant for twenty years. And then …" Poole paused, and covered his face with his hands, too upset to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是看见了嘛！是这样的，有一次我从花园突然去了实验室，我以为他离开书房找什么东西去了，书房的门开着，他就在实验室最里面，在旧箱子里翻什么东西。我进去时他抬头看了我一眼，大叫一声，转身就奔到书房里去了。我只看到他一眼，可血都要冻住了似的。先生，您说要是主人的话，他干吗脸上戴着面罩？要是主人的话，干吗像个四处被迫的野兽，从我跟前逃走？我给他当了20年的仆人，可他……”普尔将脸埋在手里，难过得说不下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is all very mysterious," said Mr Utterson, "but I think I begin to understand. Your master, Poole, is ill. And the illness has changed his appearance. Perhaps that also explains the change in his voice. It certainly explains the mask and the way he has been avoiding his friends. And of course, he's searching for these chemicals he cause he believes they will make him well again. Dear God, I hope he's right! Poor Jekyll -- that is my explanation. It's sad enough, Poole, but it's normal and natural, and there's nothing to be alarmed about."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确是桩怪事。”厄特森先生说，“我想我有点明白了。普尔，你的主人看来是病了，长相也变了，嗓音也变了，这样就能解释为什么他戴面罩了，因为他不愿见朋友；当然了，他拼命地找药，是因为他认为吃了药就会好了。上帝啊！希望他一切都好！哦！可怜的杰基尔！这是我的解释，想起来怪怕人的，但还算正常，也还算自然，不必那么担心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lawyer shook his head. "He's taken poison, Poole," he said. "I fear we've come too late to save Doctor Jekyll, and too late to punish his murderer too. Now we must find your master's body."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="律师摇摇头。“他吃了毒药，普尔。恐怕咱们还是来晚了，没法救杰基尔医生，也不可能惩罚凶手了。现在咱们得找到主人的尸体。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They searched everywhere, but there was no sign of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps your master has escaped," said Mr Utterson hopefully. He went to check the door from the laboratory into the narrow side-street. It was locked, and covered with dust. On the floor nearby he found a broken key.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许他早逃走了！”厄特森先生充满希望地说。他转身去查看从实验室通往小街的那扇门。门上了锁，到处是灰尘，旁边地上，他找到了一把折断的钥匙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a long time since anyone opened this door!" said Mr Utterson.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is too difficult for me, Pooh," said the lawyer. "Let's go back to the study."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这真叫我摸不着头脑了，普尔，”律师说，“咱们再回书房看看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They searched the study again. "Look, sir," said Poole, Pointing to a small table in the corner. There were bottles of liquid and some white powders lying in saucers. "He was testing his chemicals here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又在书房找了一遍。“先生，你看，”普尔指着屋角的小桌子，上面摆着盛着各种各样液体的小瓶子，碟子里有些白色粉末。“他在这儿实验这些药品。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Poole, picking up the broken key. "So how did Hyde get in?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，”普尔一边答道，一边捡起折断的钥匙。“那么，海德是怎么进来的呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the doctor's books was lying on the floor. Its cover was torn off. The lawyer picked it up. Doctor Jekyll loved his books and always took great care of them. But he had written all over this one -- the handwriting was unmistakable -- before tearing it and throwing it on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地上扔着医生的一本书，封皮已破烂不堪。律师把书捡起来。杰基尔博士一直很爱看书，也爱惜书，可这本书在没有被撕坏和扔到地上之前，上面写满了字，笔迹也没错。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How strange," said Mr Utterson. "Why did Jekyll want a mirror in his study?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Next they turned to the desk and found a large packet addressed to Mr Utterson. The handwriting was Doctor Jekyll's. The lawyer opened the packet and three envelopes fell out on to the floor. The first contained a will. It was like Doctor Jekyll's first win in every way -- except one. The doctor had left all his money, not to Edward Hyde, but to Gabriel John Utterson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又转身去看书桌，发现有一个大邮包，上面写着“厄特森先生收”，笔迹是杰基尔博士的。律师打开邮包，里面掉出三封信。第一封是遗嘱，和博士的第一份遗嘱一模一样，只有一条除外，博士把所有积蓄不是给了爱德华·海德，而是给了加布里埃尔·约翰·厄特森。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the lawyer noticed the tall mirror on the wall between the glass-fronted bookshelves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后律师又注意到两个玻璃书柜之间的墙上，镶着一面又高又大的镜子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="律师看了看遗嘱，又看了看普尔，最后把目光投向地板上的尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I just don't understand," he whispered. "Hyde has been here all this time -- why didn't he destroy this will?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还是不明白，”他喃喃说道，“海德一直呆在这儿——可他怎么没有把这份遗嘱毁掉呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He picked up the next envelope. It contained a short note in the doctor's handwriting. Mr Utterson saw the date. "Poole!" he cried, "this is today's date on the letter. Jekyll was alive here today. He can't be dead -- he has run away or is hiding somewhere. And if so, why? If he's alive, can we be sure that Hyde killed himself? We must be careful, Poole, or we may involve your master in some terrible danger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又拿起另一个信封，是博士手写的短笺，厄特森先生看了看日期。“普尔！”他叫道，“是今天的日期，杰基尔今天还活着，他肯定没有死——一定是逃跑了，要不就是躲起来了。真是那样的话，那又为什么呢？如果他还活着，我们能肯定海德是自杀的吗？普尔，咱们得小心行事，否则可能会把你的主人拖到什么惨祸里去的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
