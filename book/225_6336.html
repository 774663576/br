<div class="line_en">At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in its dangerous workings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初他想过德伐日，想再找到那家酒店，跟老板商量在这座疯狂状态下的城市里安排一个最安全的住所。但是那令他想起德伐日的念头同时也否定了他：德伐日住在骚乱最严重的地区，无疑在那儿很有影响，跟危险活动的关系很深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr. Lorry when business hours came round, was this:-- that he had no right to imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict man of business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="业务时间一到，在罗瑞先生办惯业务的心里首先要考虑的问题之一就是：他无权让一个在押的外逃分子的妻子停留在台尔森银行的屋檐下，给公司带来危险。为了露西和她的孩子他可以拿自己的生命、财产和安全去冒险，但由他负责的巨大公司却不属于他，对待业务责任他一向是个严格的办事人员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快正午了，医生还没有回来。每一分钟的耽误都可能给台尔森银行带来危险。罗瑞先生只好跟露西商量。她说她父亲曾说过要在银行大厦附近租赁一个短期住处。这不但不会影响业务，对查尔斯也是好的，因为即使他被释放出来，也还没有离开巴黎的希望。罗瑞先生便出去找住处。他在一条小街的高层楼上找到了一套合适的住房。那楼靠着一个萧条的广场，广场周围高楼的百叶窗全都关闭，说明住户早走光了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him, addressed him by his name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子好难挨，一天终于过去，银行下班了。他又回到前一天晚上那屋里思考着往下的步骤。这时他听见楼梯上传来了脚步声。不一会儿，一个人已来到他面前。那人目光犀利地打量了他一会儿，便叫出了他的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might, ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that delivered his note -- little thinking what it had been doing near him in the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人尽快穿过了途中的街道，走上了新居的楼梯，被杰瑞放进门去。他们看见露西一个人在哭。她一得到罗瑞先生带给她的有关她丈夫的消息便高兴得发了狂，攥住交给她条子的手不放——她却没想到那只手晚上对她的丈夫干过些什么，若是有机会又有可能对他干什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response -- dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寥寥数语，再也没有了。但收信人已是喜出望外。她离开了德伐日转向他的太太，吻了吻一只干着编织活儿的手。那是一种热情的、挚爱的、感谢的女性动作，但那手却毫无反应——它只冷冷地、沉重地垂了下去，又开始编织起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在和那手的接触中有某种东西很令露西扫兴。她正要把字条往胸衣里放，却怔住了，两手停在了脖子边，惶恐地望着德伐日太太——那个女人正冷漠地、无动于衷地瞪着她那抬起的眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope you are pretty well!" She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位小姐有个根深蒂固的信念：她比任何外国人强；她这信念也绝不会因任何苦难和危险而改变。此刻她抱着膀子出来了，用英语向她第一个瞧见的人复仇女神说，“晤，没问题，冒失鬼！但愿你身体还不错！”她对德伐日太太则咳嗽了一声——那是不列颠式的，可那两位谁都没大注意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My dear," said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; "there are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them -- that she may identify them. I believe," said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, "I state the case, Citizen Defarge?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的，”罗瑞先生急忙解释，“街道上常常出事，虽然未必会波及到你，但德伐日太太却想见见她在这种情况下可以保护的人，跟她认识一下——到时才能认得人，我相信是这样，”罗瑞先生说。他说着这些安慰的话，却也在犹豫，因为三个人的生硬表情给他的印象越来越深。“我说得对吧，德伐日公民？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You had better, Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, "have the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French."</div>
