<div class="line_en">The boy got a talking-to from our teacher. My mother went over to school to personally lay eyes on the kid, wanting to assess what kind of threat he posed. Southside, who must have been over at our house that day, got his grandfatherly hackles up and insisted on going over with her as well. I was not privy to it, but some sort of conversation between adults took place. Some type of punishment was meted out. I received a shamefaced apology from the boy and was instructed not to worry about him further.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was in first grade, a boy in my class punched me in the face one day, his fist coming like a comet, full force and out of nowhere. We'd been lining up to go to lunch, all of us discussing whatever felt urgent just then to six- and seven-year-olds -- who was the fastest runner or why crayon colors had such weird names -- when blam, I got whacked. I don't know why. I've forgotten the boy's name, but I remember staring at him dumbfounded and in pain, my lower lip already swelling, my eyes hot with tears. Too shocked to be angry, I ran home to my mom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上一年级的时候，曾被班里一个男生一拳打在脸上。那一拳突如其来，而且力气很大。当时我们正排队去吃午饭，还讨论着大家六七岁时最关心的事情—比如谁跑得最快，为什么蜡笔颜色的名字都那么怪—然后砰的一声，我就被打了，而且无缘无故。我忘了那个男生叫什么名字，只记得当时疼痛难忍，目瞪口呆地盯着他。我的下嘴唇肿了起来，眼泪也涌了上来，但当时我因为太震惊，以至于忘了生气，直接跑回了家找我母亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was how we talked about bullies. When I was a kid, it was easy to grasp: Bullies were scared people hiding inside scary people. I'd see it in DeeDee, the tough girl on my neighborhood block, and even in Dandy, my own grandfather, who could be rude and pushy even with his own wife. They lashed out because they felt overwhelmed. You avoided them if you could and stood up to them if you had to. According to my mother, who would probably want some sort of live-and-let-live slogan carved on her headstone, the key was never to let a bully's insults or aggression get to you personally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们就是这样谈论霸凌的。我当时还小，这样说比较容易理解：霸凌就是有些人心里害怕，所以去吓唬别人。在与我家相邻的一个社区里住着一个凶巴巴的女孩，名叫迪迪，她就是这样；还有我的祖父，他对自己的妻子都那么粗鲁又刻薄。他们之所以咄咄逼人，是因为内心充满了恐惧。面对这样的人，能躲就躲，躲不开就正面和他们对抗。我母亲是那种很想把“待人如待己”这类箴言刻在自己墓碑上的人。她认为处理这类情况的关键，是永远不要让恶霸的辱骂或欺凌真正影响到你。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">More than ever, there were calculations involved in how Barack spent every minute of every day. He was being watched, measured, evaluated. People took note of which states he visited, which diner he showed up at for breakfast, what kind of meat he ordered to go with his eggs. About twenty-five members of the press traveled with him continuously now, filling the back of the campaign plane, filling the corridors and breakfast rooms of small-town hotels, trailing him from stop to stop, their pens immortalizing everything. If a presidential candidate caught a cold, it got reported. If someone got an expensive haircut or asked for Dijon mustard at a TGI Fridays (as Barack had naively done years earlier, meriting an eventual headline in the New York Times), it would get reported and then parsed a hundred ways on the internet. Was the candidate weak? Was he a snob? A phony? A true American?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克每天每分钟如何度过，都是精心计算过的，当时这种情况比以往更甚。他时刻受人关注、指点、评估。人们记录他去了哪些州，在哪家餐厅吃早餐，点了哪种肉配煎蛋。他身边大概有二十五个记者不间断地跟着，他们坐满了竞选专机的后舱，将小镇旅店的走廊和餐厅围得水泄不通，从上一站跟到下一站，用笔记录下一切。总统候选人哪怕得了感冒，也会被大肆报道。有人理发贵了点，或是去星期五餐厅点了法式第戎芥末酱（贝拉克多年前曾这么干过，最后上了《纽约时报》的头条），立马就会被报道出去，然后引发网上各式各样的解读。这个候选人软弱无能？他是个小人？是个骗子？他真的是美国人吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'll begin by jumping ahead to a happy memory from that year, because I do have many of them. We visited Butte, Montana, on the Fourth of July, which happened to be Malia's tenth birthday and about four months ahead of the general election. Butte is a hardy, historic copper-mining town set down in the brushy southwestern corner of Montana, with the dark ridgeline of the Rocky Mountains visible in the distance. Butte was a toss-up town in what our campaign hoped could be a toss-up state. Montana had gone for George W. Bush in the last election but had also elected a Democratic governor. It seemed like a good place for Barack to visit.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was part of the process, we understood -- a test to see who had the mettle to hold up as both a leader and a symbol for the country itself. It was like having your soul X-rayed every day, scanned and rescanned for any sign of fallibility. You didn't get elected if you didn't first submit to the full-bore scrutiny of the American gaze, which ran itself over your entire history, including your social associations, professional choices, and tax returns. And that gaze was arguably more intense and open to manipulation than ever. We were just coming into an age where clicks were being measured and monetized. Facebook had only recently gone mainstream. Twitter was relatively new. Most American adults owned a cell phone, and most cell phones had a camera. We were standing at the edge of something I'm not sure any of us yet fully understood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只是过程中的一部分，我们都明白这是为了检验你是否具备领导这个国家，甚至代表这个国家的韧性，感觉就像每天给你的灵魂做透视，一遍遍地扫描，不放过任何差错。如果你不首先接受美国人民的全面审视，你就不会当选。这种审视贯穿了你过去的人生，包括你的社会关系、职业选择还有纳税申报单。尽管争议重重，但这种审视比以往任何时候都更强烈，更容易被操控。当时我们正进入一个点击量就代表着标准和金钱的时代。脸书刚刚成为主流，推特相对来说是个新事物。大多数美国成年人都有手机，大多数手机都有摄像头。我们那时正站在一个全新时代的边缘，我不确定我们是否真的了解这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack was no longer just trying to win the support of Democratic voters; he was now courting all of America. Following the Iowa caucuses, in a process that was at times as punishing and ugly as it was heartening and defining, Barack and Hillary Clinton had spent the winter and spring of 2008 slogging it out in every state and territory, battling vote by hard-earned vote for the privilege of becoming a boundary-breaking candidate. (John Edwards, Joe Biden, and the other contenders had all dropped out by the end of January.) The two candidates had tested each other mightily, with Barack opening up a small but ultimately decisive lead midway through February. "Is he president now?" Malia would ask me sometimes over the months that followed as we stood on one stage or another, with celebratory music blasting around us, her young mind unable to grasp anything but the larger purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were in Butte on the Fourth of July with twin purposes, because nearly everything had a twin purpose now. Barack had spent the previous four days campaigning in Missouri, Ohio, Colorado, and North Dakota. There was little time to waste by having him come off the campaign trail to celebrate Malia's birthday, and he couldn't slip out of voters' view on what was the country's most symbolic holiday. So instead we flew to him, for what would be a sort of attempt to have it both ways -- a family day spent mostly in full view of the public. Barack's half sister Maya and her husband, Konrad, came with us, along with their daughter Suhaila, a cute little four-year-old.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't until June that Hillary acknowledged that she lacked the delegate count to win. Her delay in conceding had wasted precious campaign resources, preventing Barack from being able to reorient the battle toward his Republican opponent, John McCain. The longtime Arizona senator had become the Republican Party's presumptive nominee all the way back in March and was running as a maverick war hero with a history of bipartisanship and deep experience in national security, the implication being that he'd lead differently than George W. Bush.</div>

<div class="line_en">Any parent of a child born on a major holiday knows that there's already a certain line to be walked between an individual celebration and more universal festivities. The good people of Butte seemed to get it. There were "Happy Birthday Malia!" signs taped inside the windows of storefronts along Main Street. Bystanders shouted out their good wishes to her over the pounding of bass drums and flutes piping "Yankee Doodle" as our family watched the town's Fourth of July parade from a set of bleachers. The people we met were kind to the girls and respectful to us, even when confessing that voting for any Democrat would be a half-crazy departure from tradition.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that day, the campaign hosted a picnic in an open field with views of the spiny mountains marking the Continental Divide. The gathering was meant to be a rally for several hundred of our local supporters as well as a kind of casual birthday celebration for Malia. I was moved by all the people who'd turned out to meet us, but at the same time I was feeling something more intimate and urgent that had nothing to do with where we were. I was struck that day by the gobsmacked tenderness that comes with being a parent, the weird telescoping of time that happens when you notice suddenly that your babies are half-grown, their limbs going from pudgy to lean, their eyes getting wise.</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, the Fourth of July 2008 was the most significant threshold we'd crossed: Ten years ago, Barack and I had shown up on the labor and delivery floor believing that we knew a lot about the world when, truly, we hadn't yet known a thing.</div>

<div class="line_en">So much of the last decade had been about trying to strike a balance between my family and my work, figuring out how to be loving and present for Malia and Sasha while also trying to be decent at my job. But the axis had shifted: I was now trying to balance parenting with something altogether different and more confusing -- politics, America, Barack's quest to do something important. The magnitude of what was happening in Barack's life, the demands of the campaign, the spotlight on our family, all seemed to be growing quickly. After the Iowa caucuses, I'd decided to take a leave of absence from my position at the hospital, knowing that it would be impossible, really, to stay on and be effective. The campaign was slowly consuming everything. I'd been too busy after Iowa to even go over and box up the things in my office or say any sort of proper good-bye. I was a full-time mother and wife now, albeit a wife with a cause and a mother who wanted to guard her kids against getting swallowed by that cause. It had been painful to step away from my work, but there was no choice: My family needed me, and that mattered more.</div>

<div class="line_en">I watched Sasha and Malia these days with a new fierceness in my heart. Like me, they now had strangers calling their names, people wanting to touch them and take their pictures. Over the winter, the government had deemed me and the girls exposed enough to assign us Secret Service protection, which meant that when Sasha and Malia went to school or their summer day camp, usually driven by my mother, it was with the Secret Service tailing them in a second car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些日子里，面对萨沙和玛利亚，我心里产生了前所未有的保护欲。跟我的处境一样，总有陌生人喊她们的名字，还有人想碰触她们，跟她们拍照。入冬以来，政府的人认为我跟女儿们的曝光率很高，因此派了特工保护我们。这意味着当萨沙和玛利亚去上学或去参加夏令营时，以往只是外祖母接送她们，以后后面则会跟着特工的车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so here I was at a campaign picnic in Montana, leading a group of mostly strangers in singing "Happy Birthday" to Malia, who sat smiling on the grass with a hamburger on her plate. Voters saw our daughters as sweet, I knew, and our family's closeness as endearing. But I did think often of how all this appeared to our daughters, what their view was looking outward. I tried to tamp down any guilt. We had a real birthday party planned for the following weekend, one involving a heap of Malia's friends sleeping over at our house in Chicago and no politics whatsoever. And that evening, we'd hold a more private gathering back at our hotel. Still, as the afternoon went on and our girls ran around the picnic grounds while Barack and I shook hands and hugged potential voters, I found myself wondering if the two of them would remember this outing as fun.</div>

<div class="line_en">The girls made campaigning more relaxing, if only because they weren't much invested in the outcome. For both me and Barack, they were a relief to be around -- a reminder that in the end our family meant more than any tallying of supporters or bump in the polls. Neither daughter cared much about the hubbub surrounding their dad. They weren't focused on building a better democracy or getting to the White House. All they really wanted (really, really wanted) was a puppy. They loved playing tag or card games with campaign staff during the quieter moments and made a point of finding an ice cream shop in every new place they went. Everything else was just noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女儿的陪伴让竞选的过程轻松了不少，因为结果如何对她们来说并不重要。对我和贝拉克来说，这是一种安慰—有她们在就是一种提醒，不管怎样，一家人在一起比支持者暴增或票数暴涨都重要。两个女儿谁都不关心爸爸闹哄哄的竞选，也不在乎建立更好的民主制度，或是住进白宫，她们只想要（而且是非常想要）一只小狗。安静的时候，她们就和团队里的人玩接龙或纸牌游戏；再就是强调，无论去哪里，那附近一定要有冰激凌店。除此之外，其他一切对她们而言只不过是噪音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the picnic, each one of us had our own agent flanking us, canvassing the gathering for any sign of threat, subtly intervening if a well-wisher got overenthused and grabby. Thankfully, the girls seemed to see the agents less as guards and more as grown-up friends, new additions to the growing knot of friendly people with whom we traveled, distinguishable only by their earpieces and quiet vigilance. Sasha generally referred to them as "the secret people."</div>

Barack gave his stump speech and shook the usual number of hands, but he also got to anchor himself back inside the unit of us. Sasha and Malia climbed all over him, giggling and regaling him with their thoughts. I saw the lightness in his smile, admiring him for his ability to block out the peripheral distractions and just be a dad when he had the chance.

<div class="line_en">We were never alone. We had staff around us, agents guarding us, members of the press waiting for interviews, onlookers snapping pictures from a distance. But this was now our normal. Over the course of the campaign, our days had become so programmed that we'd watched our privacy and autonomy slowly slip away, both Barack and I handing nearly every aspect of our lives over to a bunch of twentysomethings who were highly intelligent and capable but still couldn't know how painful it could feel to give up control over my own life. If I needed something at the store, I had to ask someone to get it for me. If I wanted to speak to Barack, I usually had to send a request through one of his young staffers. Events and activities I didn't know about would sometimes show up on my calendar.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the afternoon ended in Butte, we gave a TV interview, all four of us -- me, Barack, and the girls -- which was something we'd never done before. Usually, we insisted on keeping the press corps at a distance from our kids, limiting them to photos and then only at public campaign events. I'm not sure what prompted us to say yes this time. As I recall, the campaign staff thought it would be nice to give the public a closer glimpse of Barack as a parent, and in the moment I saw no harm in this. He loved our children, after all. He loved all children. It was precisely why he'd make a great president.</div>

<div class="line_en">We sat down for about fifteen minutes with Maria Menounos of Access Hollywood, the four of us speaking to her while sitting together on a park bench that had been draped with some sort of cloth to make it look more festive. Malia had her hair braided and Sasha wore a red tank dress. As always, they were disarmingly cute. Menounos was gracious and kept the conversation light as Malia, the family's junior professor, earnestly pondered every question. She said that her dad embarrassed her sometimes when he tried to shake hands with her friends and also that he bothered all of us when he left his campaign luggage blocking the door at home. Sasha did her best to sit still and stay focused, interrupting the interview only once, turning to me to ask, "Hey, when are we getting ice cream?" Otherwise, she listened to her sister, interjecting periodically with whatever semirelevant detail popped into her head. "Daddy had an Afro once!" she squealed at one point toward the end, and we all started to laugh.</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately, Barack and I regretted what we'd done. There was nothing salacious about the interview. There was no exploitative question asked, no especially revealing detail offered. Still, we felt like we'd made a wrong choice, putting their voices into the public sphere long before they could really understand what any of it meant. Nothing in the video would hurt Sasha or Malia. But it was out in the world now and would live forever on the internet. We'd taken two young girls who hadn't chosen this life, and without thinking it through, we'd fed them into the maw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克和我立马对自己的所作所为感到后悔。那次采访没有任何不妥，既没有爆炸性的提问，也没有披露任何特别的细节，但我们仍然觉得自己错了，过早地把她们暴露在公众的视野里，而她们根本不懂这意味着什么。电视里的内容不会伤害到萨沙和玛利亚，但已经传遍了世界，并且将永远保留在网络上面。我们把两个女儿带入了并非她们自己所选的人生，还没考虑清楚，一切就已经发生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By now, I knew something about the maw. We lived with the gaze upon us. It added a strange energy to everything. I had Oprah Winfrey sending me encouraging texts. Stevie Wonder, my childhood idol, was showing up to play at campaign events, joking and calling me by my first name as if we'd known each other forever. The amount of attention was disorienting, especially because I felt as if we hadn't really done much to deserve it. We were being lifted by the strength of the message Barack was putting forward, but also, I knew, by the promise and the symbolism of the moment. If America elected its first black president, it would say something not just about Barack but also about the country. For so many people, and for so many reasons, this mattered a lot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，我渐渐熟悉了这一切。我们生活在大家的目光下，一切也因此变得充满了某种能量。奥普拉·温弗瑞发短信鼓励我；史提夫·汪达，我儿时的偶像，在竞选活动中登台演唱，并且直呼其名地跟我开玩笑，仿佛我们已经认识了很久。巨大的关注让我无所适从，特别是我感觉，我们并没有做什么值得如此关注的事。我明白，我们被拥上高台，不仅是因为贝拉克强大的竞选宣传，更是因为这个重大历史时刻的潜在影响和象征意义。如果美国选举出第一位黑人总统，就不只关乎贝拉克个人，而是关系到整个美国。对许多人来说，无论出于什么原因，这都意义重大。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was aware of rumors and misperceptions that got pumped like toxic vapor into the campaign, but rarely did any of it bother him. Barack had lived through other campaigns.

<div class="line_en">After Barack's victory in Iowa, my message on the campaign trail grew only more impassioned, almost proportional to the size of the crowds that were turning out at rallies. I'd gone from meeting hundreds of people at a gathering to a thousand or more. I remember pulling up to an event in Delaware with Melissa and Katie and seeing a line of people five-deep and stretching around the block, waiting to get inside an already-jammed auditorium. It stunned me in the happiest of ways. I relayed this to every crowd: I was floored by what people were bringing to Barack's campaign in terms of enthusiasm and involvement. I was humbled by their investment, the work I saw everyday people doing to help get him elected.</div>

My words weren't polished, and I'd never be as eloquent as my husband, but I spoke from the heart. I described how my initial doubts about the political process had slowly diminished week by week, replaced by something more encouraging and hopeful. So many of us, I was realizing, had the same struggles, the same concerns for our kids and worries about the future. And so many believed as I did that Barack was the only candidate capable of delivering real change.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was both right and wrong about this. On February 19, 2008, Barack won the Wisconsin primary by a good margin, which seemed to suggest I'd done him no damage there. That same day, Cindy McCain took a potshot at me while speaking at a rally, saying, "I am proud of my country. I don't know about you, if you heard those words earlier -- I am very proud of my country." CNN deemed us to be in a "patriotism flap," and the bloggers did what bloggers do. But within about a week, it seemed that most of the commotion had died down. Barack and I both made comments to the press, clarifying that I felt a pride in seeing so many Americans making phone calls for the campaign, talking to their neighbors, and gaining confidence about their power inside our democracy, which to me did feel like a first. And then we moved on. In my campaign speeches, I tried to be more careful about how the words came out of my mouth, but my message remained the same. I was still proud and still encouraged. Nothing there had changed.</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet a pernicious seed had been planted -- a perception of me as disgruntled and vaguely hostile, lacking some expected level of grace. Whether it was originating from Barack's political opponents or elsewhere, we couldn't tell, but the rumors and slanted commentary almost always carried less-than-subtle messaging about race, meant to stir up the deepest and ugliest kind of fear within the voting public. Don't let the black folks take over. They're not like you. Their vision is not yours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而一粒邪恶的种子自此生根发芽—我给人们留下了这样的印象：满腹牢骚，充满恶意，根本不像期待中的那样得体。无论是贝拉克的竞争对手还是别的散播者，这些谣言和指向性极强的评论，大多数都有些微种族色彩，旨在挑起公众内心最深处的最丑陋的恐惧。“别让黑人当政。”“他们跟你们不是一伙人。”“他们想要的跟你不一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This wasn't helped by the fact that ABC News had combed through twenty-nine hours of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright's sermons, splicing together a jarring highlight reel that showed the preacher careening through callous and inappropriate fits of rage and resentment at white America, as if white people were to blame for every woe. Barack and I were dismayed to see this, a reflection of the worst and most paranoid parts of the man who'd married us and baptized our children. Both of us had grown up with family members who viewed race through a lens of cranky mistrust. I'd experienced Dandy's simmering resentment over the decades he'd spent being passed by professionally because of his skin color, as well as Southside's worries that his grandkids weren't safe in white neighborhoods. Barack, meanwhile, had listened to Toot, his white grandmother, make offhanded ethnic generalizations and even confess to her black grandson that she sometimes felt afraid when running into a black man on the street. We had lived for years with the narrow-mindedness of some of our elders, having accepted that no one is perfect, particularly those who'd come of age in a time of segregation. Perhaps this had caused us to overlook the more absurd parts of Reverend Wright's spitfire preaching, even if we hadn't been present for any of the sermons in question. Seeing an extreme version of his vitriol broadcast in the news, though, we were appalled. The whole affair was a reminder of how our country's distortions about race could be two-sided -- that the suspicion and stereotyping ran both ways.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而美国新闻网的做法让这一切雪上加霜。他们梳理了耶利米·莱特牧师长达二十九小时的布道内容，其拼凑出的场景异常刺眼，显得这位牧师冷酷又无理，将愤怒和怨恨全部发泄在了美国白人身上，仿佛所有痛苦都是他们造成的。贝拉克和我看到后大吃一惊，这位牧师曾主持过我们的婚礼，还曾为我们的女儿施行洗礼，在那二十九小时的布道内容里却显出了他最糟糕又最疑神疑鬼的一面。其实我和贝拉克的家人中，都不乏戴着愤怒和怀疑的有色眼镜看待种族问题的人。我曾感受过祖父长久以来的怨恨，就因为他的肤色，他一直找不到什么好工作。我也了解过“南城的”的顾虑，他担心自己的孙子住在白人社区不安全。贝拉克也一样，他曾听见过他的白人外祖母随意地将黑人一概而论，并且向自己的黑人外孙坦白说，有时候在街上碰到黑人令她很害怕。我们跟家族中某些保守有偏见的长辈生活了许多年，也能理解他们做不到宽容，特别是对那些经历过种族隔离时代的长辈而言。也许正因为如此，我们忽视了耶利米·莱特牧师那滔滔不绝的布道中最为荒谬的部分，即使那些有问题的布道我们一场也没有参加过。看到他那些尖刻的言论以如此极端的形式出现在新闻上，我们真是胆战心惊。整个事件提醒我们，我们美国对种族问题的扭曲是双向的—怀疑和成见始终是双向的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone, meanwhile, had dug up my senior thesis from Princeton, written more than two decades earlier -- a survey that looked at how African American alumni felt about race and identity after being at Princeton. For reasons I'll never understand, the conservative media was treating my paper as if it were some secret black-power manifesto, a threat that had been unburied. It was as if at the age of twenty-one, instead of trying to get an A in sociology and a spot at Harvard Law School, I'd been hatching a Nat Turner plan to overthrow the white majority and was now finally, through my husband, getting a chance to put it in motion. "Is Michelle Obama Responsible for the Jeremiah Wright Fiasco?" was the subtitle of an online column written by the author Christopher Hitchens. He tore into the college-age me, suggesting that I'd been unduly influenced by black radical thinkers and furthermore was a crappy writer. "To describe it as hard to read would be a mistake," he wrote. "The thesis cannot be 'read' at all, in the strict sense of the verb. This is because it wasn't written in any known language."</div>

<div class="line_en">As we carried on through primaries in Ohio and Texas, in Vermont and Mississippi, I had continued to speak about optimism and unity, feeling the positivity of people at campaign events coalescing around the idea of change. All along, though, the unflattering counternarrative about me seemed only to gain traction. On Fox News, there'd be discussions of my "militant anger." The internet would produce more rumors that a videotape existed of me referring to white people as "whitey," which was outlandish and just plainly untrue. In June, when Barack finally clinched the Democratic nomination, I'd greet him with a playful fist bump onstage at an event in Minnesota, which would then make headlines, interpreted by one Fox commentator as a "terrorist fist jab," again suggesting that we were dangerous. A news chyron on the same network had referred to me as "Obama's Baby Mama," conjuring clichéd notions of black-ghetto America, implying an otherness that put me outside even my own marriage.</div>

It was a small-minded and ludicrous insult, sure, but his mocking of my intellect, his marginalizing of my young self, carried with it a larger dismissiveness. Barack and I were now too well-known to be rendered invisible, but if people saw us as alien and trespassing, then maybe our potency could be drained. The message seemed often to get telegraphed, if never said directly: These people don't belong. A photo of Barack wearing a turban and traditional Somali clothing that had been bestowed on him during an official visit he'd made to Kenya as a senator had shown up on the Drudge Report, reviving old theories that he was secretly Muslim. A few months later, the internet would burp up another anonymous and unfounded rumor, this one questioning Barack's citizenship, floating the idea that he'd been born not in Hawaii but in Kenya, which would make him ineligible to become president.</div>

Painfully, too, my friends would sometimes call and unload their worries on me, heaping me with advice they thought I should pass on to Barack's campaign manager or wanting me to reassure them after they'd heard a negative news report about me, or Barack, or the state of the campaign. When rumors about the so-called whitey tape surfaced, a friend who knows me well called up, clearly worried that the lie was true.

Hillary's gender was used against her relentlessly, drawing from all the worst stereotypes. She was called domineering, a nag, a bitch. Her voice was interpreted as screechy; her laugh was a cackle.

<div class="line_en">Reviewing videotape with Axe and Valerie that day, I felt tears pricking at my eyes. I was upset. I could see now that there was a performative piece to politics that I hadn't yet fully mastered. And I'd been out there giving speeches already for more than a year. I'd communicated best, I realized now, in smaller venues like the ones I'd done in Iowa. It was harder to convey warmth in larger auditoriums. Bigger crowds required clearer facial cues, which was something I needed to work on. I was worried now that it was almost too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与阿昔洛和瓦莱丽一起看录像的那天，我的眼睛被泪水刺得生疼。我非常沮丧。那时我终于明白，我完全没有掌握政治表演那一套。而这一年多来，我已经做了无数场演说。我意识到，在爱荷华州那些小礼堂里，我在尽力跟听众沟通。而在更大的场地中，要传达温暖无疑更难。听众越多，演说者的表情就要越鲜明，对此我需要好好下一番功夫。然而，我担心事到如今已经太迟了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, this was a turnaround point. The campaign apparatus existed exclusively to serve the candidate, not the spouse or the family. And as much as Barack's staffers respected me and valued my contribution, they'd never given me much in the way of guidance. Until that point, no one from the campaign had bothered to travel with me or show up for my events. I'd never received media training or speech prep. No one, I realized, was going to look out for me unless I pushed for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Knowing that the gaze was only going to intensify as we moved into the last six or so months of the campaign, we agreed, finally, that I needed real help. If I was going to continue to campaign like a candidate, I needed to be supported like a candidate. I'd protect myself by being better organized, by insisting on having the resources I needed to do the job well. In the final weeks of the primaries, Barack's campaign began expanding my team to include a scheduler and a personal aide -- Kristen Jarvis, a warmhearted former staffer from Barack's U. S. Senate office whose steady demeanor would keep me grounded in high-stress moments -- plus a no-nonsense, politically savvy communications specialist named Stephanie Cutter. Working with Katie and Melissa, Stephanie helped me sharpen my message and my presentation, building toward a major speech I'd deliver late that summer at the Democratic National Convention. We were also finally granted access to a campaign plane, which allowed me to move more efficiently. I could now give media interviews during flights, get my hair and makeup done en route to an event, or bring Sasha and Malia along with me at no extra cost.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we planned my public appearances, Stephanie counseled me to play to my strengths and to remember the things I most enjoyed talking about, which was my love for my husband and kids, my connection with working mothers, and my proud Chicago roots. She recognized that I liked to joke around and told me not to hold back with my humor. It was okay, in other words, to be myself. Shortly after the primaries wrapped up, I signed on to co-host The View, spending a happy and spirited hour with Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, and the other hosts in front of a live audience, talking about the attacks against me, but also laughing about the girls and the fist bumps and the nuisance of panty hose. I felt a new ease, a new ownership of my voice. The show aired to generally positive commentary. I'd worn a $148 black-and-white dress that women were suddenly scrambling to buy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在准备我的公开演说时，史蒂芬妮建议我发挥自己的长处，专注在那些我擅于表达的事情上，比如我对丈夫和孩子的爱，我对职场母亲的理解，以及我引以为豪的芝加哥出身。她发现我喜欢跟身边的人开玩笑，就告诉我不要压抑自己的幽默感。换句话说，我可以尽情地展示自我。预选结束后不久，我担任了《视野》节目的嘉宾主持，与乌比·戈德堡、芭芭拉·沃尔特斯和其他主持人一起，面对现场的观众，度过了愉快又精彩的一个小时。我们谈论了那些针对我的攻击，但也聊了女儿们的趣事，并且取笑了那次碰拳事件和连裤袜有多难穿。我感到了一种全新的轻松，一种重新找回自己声音的感觉。节目播出后获得了多数正面的反馈。我上节目时穿的那条148美元的黑白相间的连衣裙，突然间成了女士们争相购买的款式。">查看中文翻译</div>

For me, the most humbling lessons came when I visited military communities and met with soldiers' spouses -- groups of mostly women, though sometimes with a few men mixed in.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tell me about your lives," I'd say. And then I'd listen as women with babies on their laps, some of them still teenagers themselves, told me stories. Some described being transferred between bases eight or more times in as many years, in each instance needing to start over in settling their children into things like music lessons or enrichment programs. They explained, too, how difficult it could be to maintain a career over the course of all those moves: A teacher, for instance, wasn't able to find a job because her new state didn't recognize the old state's teaching certificate; nail technicians and physical therapists faced similar problems with licensing. Many young parents had trouble finding affordable child care. All of it, of course, was shaded by the logistical and emotional burdens of having a loved one deployed for twelve months or more at a time to a place like Kabul or Mosul or on an aircraft carrier in the South China Sea. Meeting these spouses instantly put whatever hurt I was feeling into perspective. Their sacrifices were far greater than mine. I sat in these meetings, engrossed and somewhat taken aback by the fact that I knew so little about military life. I vowed to myself that if Barack was fortunate enough to be elected, I'd find some way to better support these families.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说说你们的生活吧。”我会说。然后听那些抱着孩子的女性告诉我她们的故事，她们中有的还不满二十岁。有些人说自己这些年来换过八次驻地，甚至更多，大致是一年一换，每到一个新环境，就要重新给孩子找音乐培训班或者强化班。她们还说，这样迁来迁去根本无法维持生计：例如有位找不到工作的教师，她新迁去的州不承认原来那个州的教师执业资格证；美甲师和理疗师也面临同样的执照问题；许多年轻的父母找不到一家能负担得起的托儿所。毫无疑问，所有这些问题，都隐藏在顾全大局和深明大义的担当背后。她们的爱人被派往喀布尔或摩苏尔那样的地方，服役一年或是更久。与这些军属的会面让我瞬间放下了我所受到的伤害。她们所做的牺牲远不是我可以比的。我坐在她们中间，全神贯注地听着，发现自己对军事生活一无所知。我暗暗发誓，如果贝拉克如愿当选，我一定要想办法更好地支持这些家庭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would go on to spend the summer of 2008 moving faster and working harder, convinced that I could make a positive difference for Barack. With the convention drawing close, I worked with a speechwriter for the first time, a gifted young woman named Sarah Hurwitz who helped shape my ideas into a tight seventeen-minute speech. After weeks of careful preparation, I walked onstage at the Pepsi Center in Denver in late August and stood before an audience of some twenty thousand people and a TV audience of millions more, ready to articulate to the world who I really was.</div>

At public events, I focused on making personal connections with the people I met, in small groups and in crowds of thousands, in backstage chats and harried rope lines. When voters got to see me as a person, they understood that the caricatures were untrue. I've learned that it's harder to hate up close.</div>

Stages, audiences, lights, applause. These were becoming more normal than I'd ever thought they could be.

We got together in a fluorescent-lit, low-ceilinged conference room in the basement of the hotel, with Konrad, Maya, and Suhaila, plus a handful of staffers who were close with Malia, and of course the Secret Service agents, who were always close no matter what. We had some balloons, a grocery-store cake, ten candles, and a tub of ice cream. There were a few gifts bought and wrapped on the fly by someone who was not me. The mood was not exactly desultory, but it wasn't festive, either. It had simply been too long of a day. Barack and I shared a dark look, knowing we'd failed.</div>
