<div class="line_en">He drew the chair near the fire and she sat in it. He mixed her whiskey and soda, and, sobbing still, she drank it. She looked at him with great, mournful eyes. There were large black lines under them. She was thinner and whiter than when last he had seen her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把椅子拉到壁炉边让她坐下，兑了杯威士忌苏打，看她抽抽泣泣地喝下去。她满含哀伤的眼睛看着他，眼圈又黑又肿。比上次见面时瘦了不少，更加虚弱苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>

If you'd only heard the things he said to me! But I found out precious quick that he wasn't a gentleman. He left me without a penny. He hadn't paid the rent, and I hadn't got the money to pay it, and the woman who kept the house said such things to me -- well, I might have been a thief the way she talked."</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought of Emil Miller, with his pasty, unhealthy look, his shifty blue eyes, and the vulgar smartness of his appearance; he always wore bright red knitted waistcoats. Philip sighed. She got up and went to him. She put her arm round his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普想起了埃米尔·米勒。病殃殃的煞白的脸、滴溜溜转的蓝色眼珠、总是穿一件鲜红的针织马甲，一看就是个庸俗不堪的精明小人。他长长叹了口气。米尔德里德起身向他走来，抱着他的脖子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went on talking, and soon they had returned to the familiar companionship of old days. It grew late. Philip suggested that they should dine together and go to a music-hall. She wanted some persuasion, for she had an idea of acting up to her situation, and felt instinctively that it did not accord with her distressed condition to go to a place of entertainment. At last Philip asked her to go simply to please him, and when she could look upon it as an act of self-sacrifice she accepted. She had a new thoughtfulness which delighted Philip. She asked him to take her to the little restaurant in Soho to which they had so often been; he was infinitely grateful to her, because her suggestion showed that happy memories were attached to it. She grew much more cheerful as dinner proceeded. The Burgundy from the public house at the corner warmed her heart, and she forgot that she ought to preserve a dolorous countenance. Philip thought it safe to speak to her of the future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们继续聊，很快就像过去一样熟悉、亲密。天渐渐黑了。菲利普请她一起吃晚饭，再去杂耍剧院看戏。她扭捏作态，想让菲利普再劝劝她。因为按眼下这种情况，她不该表现得太无所谓，也不该去那种娱乐场所，甚至一副痛苦不堪的惨样才最合时宜。最后，菲利普说就当是陪他去放松一下，她大可把这当成是为菲利普所做的自我牺牲。她比以前心思细腻了许多，这让菲利普刮目相看。她请菲利普带自己去索霍街的那家他们常去的小馆子。这个提议简直让菲利普感激不已，因为她似乎还在念着旧情和曾经发生在那里的幸福回忆。餐桌上，她兴致越来越高。从街角酒馆里买来的勃艮第酒让她心里慢慢热乎起来，甚至忘了这个节骨眼儿上应该表现得愁眉苦脸才对。菲利普觉得现在不妨跟她谈谈将来。">查看中文翻译</div>

He needed rigid economy to make his own money last till he was qualified, and he must have something over to keep him during the year he intended to spend as house physician and house surgeon either at his own or at some other hospital.

<div class="line_en">By degrees Philip learned how the separation had come about. It appeared that the fellow's wife had discovered the adventure he was engaged in during his periodical visits to London, and had gone to the head of the firm that employed him. She threatened to divorce him, and they announced that they would dismiss him if she did. He was passionately devoted to his children and could not bear the thought of being separated from them. When he had to choose between his wife and his mistress he chose his wife. He had been always anxious that there should be no child to make the entanglement more complicated; and when Mildred, unable longer to conceal its approach, informed him of the fact, he was seized with panic. He picked a quarrel and left her without more ado.</div>
