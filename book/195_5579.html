<div class="line_en">The following day was Tuesday. Philip as usual hurried through his breakfast and dashed off to get to his lecture at nine. He had only time to exchange a few words with Mildred. When he came back in the evening he found her seated at the window, darning his socks.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a frugal supper Philip filled his pouch with tobacco and put on his hat.

<div class="line_en">"I'm sure Lawson would love that green skin of yours," said Philip. "He'd say it was so paintable, but I'm terribly matter of fact nowadays, and I shan't be happy till you're as pink and white as a milkmaid."</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip always went to the tavern with a sense of pleasure. Macalister, the philosophic stockbroker, was generally there and glad to argue upon any subject under the sun; Hayward came regularly when he was in London; and though he and Macalister disliked one another they continued out of habit to meet on that one evening in the week. Macalister thought Hayward a poor creature, and sneered at his delicacies of sentiment: he asked satirically about Hayward's literary work and received with scornful smiles his vague suggestions of future masterpieces; their arguments were often heated; but the punch was good, and they were both fond of it; towards the end of the evening they generally composed their differences and thought each other capital fellows. This evening Philip found them both there, and Lawson also; Lawson came more seldom now that he was beginning to know people in London and went out to dinner a good deal. They were all on excellent terms with themselves, for Macalister had given them a good thing on the Stock Exchange, and Hayward and Lawson had made fifty pounds apiece. It was a great thing for Lawson, who was extravagant and earned little money: he had arrived at that stage of the portrait-painter's career when he was noticed a good deal by the critics and found a number of aristocratic ladies who were willing to allow him to paint them for nothing (it advertised them both, and gave the great ladies quite an air of patronesses of the arts); but he very seldom got hold of the solid philistine who was ready to pay good money for a portrait of his wife. Lawson was brimming over with satisfaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普每次到酒馆去都觉得一身轻松。那个张口闭口净是哲学理论的股票经纪人麦卡利斯特通常也在那儿，普天之下的东西没有他不喜欢讨论的。海沃德只要在伦敦也会定期去那儿碰面。尽管他和麦卡利斯特互相瞧不上，可还是习惯每周在这儿聚一次。麦卡利斯特觉得海沃德是个很可怜的人，总要拿他多愁善感的性格挖苦一通。他故意酸溜溜地问海沃德写过什么文学作品，当海沃德含糊其辞地说将来准备创作几部杰作时，他便轻蔑地笑着点点头。他俩经常争得面红耳赤，言辞激烈，可这家酒馆的鸡尾酒着实可口，他们都很喜欢喝，所以每次酒过三巡，该回家了，他俩都能握手言和，觉得对方怎么看怎么顺眼。这天晚上，两个活宝都来酒馆了，劳森竟然也在。他最近和在伦敦认识的人交往频繁，经常一块出去吃饭，来酒馆的次数少之又少。这些人今晚表现得特别亲热，大概是因为麦卡利斯特在证券交易所上给他们寻了笔好买卖吧，海沃德和劳森都各挣了五十英镑。这笔收入对劳森来说可真算雪中送炭了，他花钱大手大脚，可惜挣得又不多。作为一个肖像画师，他的职业生涯到达了这样一个阶段：评论家都非常关注他的作品，很多贵族太太都愿意让他给画肖像，可是一分钱报酬都没有（这种行为对双方都有益，显得贵夫人们对艺术行为很慷慨）。有些荷包满满、头脑空空的人愿意出大钱请人来给自己的夫人画像，可他又很少能逮住这种机会。跟着麦卡利斯特挣了点钱后，他乐得下巴都合不拢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I heard of a good thing last Tuesday, and I asked these fellows if they'd like to have a flutter, I bought them a thousand shares on Wednesday morning, and there was a rise in the afternoon so I sold them at once. I made fifty pounds for each of them and a couple of hundred for myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was sick with envy. He had recently sold the last mortgage in which his small fortune had been invested and now had only six hundred pounds left. He was panic-stricken sometimes when he thought of the future. He had still to keep himself for two years before he could be qualified, and then he meant to try for hospital appointments, so that he could not expect to earn anything for three years at least. With the most rigid economy he would not have more than a hundred pounds left then. It was very little to have as a stand-by in case he was ill and could not earn money or found himself at any time without work. A lucky gamble would make all the difference to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普嫉妒得眼都红了。他最近刚把最后一张抵押契据卖出去，现在手头上只剩了六百镑。有时一想起以后的事，他就有点心慌。还得两年才能取得从医资格，之后还要在医院任职一段时间，这么看来，未来至少三年内都别指望能挣到什么钱。即使把一分钱掰成八瓣花，他也很难在三年之后剩下一百多镑的积蓄。万一到时候生个病，或者没能及时找到工作，这点钱都不一定够用。一场幸运的赌博可是能帮上他大忙。">查看中文翻译</div>

They ate very simply, but she liked to take a long time to buy the few things they needed; she could not be bothered to cook anything for her dinner, but made herself some cocoa and ate bread and butter; then she took the baby out in the gocart, and when she came in spent the rest of the afternoon in idleness. She was tired out, and it suited her to do so little. She made friends with Philip's forbidding landlady over the rent, which he left with Mildred to pay, and within a week was able to tell him more about his neighbours than he had learned in a year.</div>

The baby was asleep and could be safely left; Mildred said she had always left it alone at night when she went out; it never woke. She was in high spirits when she came back with her hat on. She had taken the opportunity to put on a little rouge. Philip thought it was excitement which had brought a faint colour to her pale cheeks; he was touched by her child-like delight, and reproached himself for the austerity with which he had treated her. She laughed when she got out into the air. The first tram they saw was going towards Westminster Bridge and they got on it. Philip smoked his pipe, and they looked at the crowded street. The shops were open, gaily lit, and people were doing their shopping for the next day. They passed a music-hall called the Canterbury and Mildred cried out:</div>

They got capital seats for sixpence each, high up but not in the gallery, and the night was so fine that there was plenty of room. Mildred's eyes glistened. She enjoyed herself thoroughly. There was a simple-mindedness in her which touched Philip. She was a puzzle to him. Certain things in her still pleased him, and he thought that there was a lot in her which was very good: she had been badly brought up, and her life was hard; he had blamed her for much that she could not help; and it was his own fault if he had asked virtues from her which it was not in her power to give. Under different circumstances she might have been a charming girl. She was extraordinarily unfit for the battle of life. As he watched her now in profile, her mouth slightly open and that delicate flush on her cheeks, he thought she looked strangely virginal. He felt an overwhelming compassion for her, and with all his heart he forgave her for the misery she had caused him. The smoky atmosphere made Philip's eyes ache, but when he suggested going she turned to him with beseeching face and asked him to stay till the end. He smiled and consented. She took his hand and held it for the rest of the performance. When they streamed out with the audience into the crowded street she did not want to go home; they wandered up the Westminster Bridge Road, looking at the people.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip's heart was full, and he was thankful to the fates because he had carried out his sudden impulse to take Mildred and her baby into his flat. It was very pleasant to see her happy gratitude. At last she grew tired and they jumped on a tram to go home; it was late now, and when they got down and turned into their own street there was no one about. Mildred slipped her arm through his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普心里很满足，他感谢命运的安排，让自己能突发奇想要米尔德里德和孩子搬过来一起住。看她过得开开心心的，还心怀感激，莫不是件值得高兴的事？最后，她终于走累了，坐上回家的电车。天色已经很晚，等下了车拐到他们住的那条街时，外面早就看不到什么人了。米尔德里德挽着菲利普的手臂，说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had never called him Phil before, that was what Griffiths called him; and even now it gave him a curious pang. He remembered how much he had wanted to die then; his pain had been so great that he had thought quite seriously of committing suicide. It all seemed very long ago. He smiled at his past self. Now he felt nothing for Mildred but infinite pity. They reached the house, and when they got into the sitting-room Philip lit the gas.</div>
