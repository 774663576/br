<div class="line_en">Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school. Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit).</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted "Hogwarts!" He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys' kitchen and Mrs. Weasley's tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagall's office. She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走进碧绿的炉火，喊了一声“霍格沃茨！”最后瞥了一眼韦斯莱家的厨房和韦斯莱夫人的泪容，就被火焰包围了。在高速旋转中他模糊地看见一些巫师的房间，都是没等看清就一闪而过了。然后他转得慢下来，端端正正地停在麦格教授的壁炉里。他爬出来时，正在工作的教授几乎连头都没抬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall's office and off toward Gryffindor Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed; the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利戴正眼镜，抹平头发，罗恩也旋转着出现了。金妮到了之后，三人一起走出麦格教授的办公室，朝格兰芬多塔楼走去。哈利望了望走廊窗户外面，太阳已经落到地平线上，场地上的积雪比陋居花园里还要深。远处可以看到海格在他的小屋前喂巴克比克。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But at that moment there was a loud squeal of "Won-Won!" and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron's arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said, "There's a cable over here… Coming. Ginny?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，他们忽然听见了一声响亮的尖叫：“罗－罗！”拉文德不知从哪儿冲了出来，扑进罗恩的怀里。旁边有几个人吃吃地笑着。赫敏银铃般地笑了一声，说道：“那边有张桌子……过去吗，金妮？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Great," said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night. "I've got loads to tell him -- and you. Let's sit down --"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，谢谢，我说好要去见迪安的。”金妮说。哈利不禁注意到她不是很热心。罗恩和拉文德纠缠在一种直立式摔跤中，哈利就带着赫敏走到了那张空桌子前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore's writing on it.</div>

Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped up to walk with Neville.</div>

It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts.

<div class="line_en">It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts' house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots. The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left.</div>

Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded across the valley to 'the big house over the way.' There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him.

He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain.

<div class="line_en">"Good gracious, is it that time already?" said Slughorn. "You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery."</div>

<div class="line_en">And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn's voice boomed out again, just as it had done before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又来了：屋里浓雾弥漫，哈利既看不见斯拉格霍恩也看不见里德尔了，只有邓布利多在他身边安详地微笑着。然后斯拉格霍恩的声音再次洪亮地响起，跟刚才一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, that's that," said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry. "Time to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，就这样。”邓布利多在哈利旁边平静地说，“该走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多说过这是最重要的记忆，可他看不出重要在哪里。当然，那突如其来的白雾，并且似乎没人注意到它，是很奇怪，但除此之外好像没发生什么，只是里德尔问了一个问题，没得到回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers," said Dumbledore. "He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see.

<div class="line_en">"Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both," said Dumbledore. "He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯拉格霍恩教授是个非常有能耐的巫师，会防到这两招的。他大脑封闭的功夫比可怜的莫芬高多了。自从我逼他交给我这个失真的记忆之后，他不随身带着吐真剂的解药才怪呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry… How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good luck… and good night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，企图强行从斯拉格霍恩教授那儿获取真相是愚蠢的，弊大于利。我不希望他离开霍格沃茨。不过，他像我们大家一样有自己的弱点，我相信你是能够突破他防线的人。拿到真实的记忆非常重要，哈利……具体有多重要，只有在看了真东西之后才知道。所以，祝你好运……晚安。”">查看中文翻译</div>
