<div class="line_en">Remember my party, remember my party, said Peter Walsh as he stepped down the street, speaking to himself rhythmically, in time with the flow of the sound, the direct downright sound of Big Ben striking the half-hour. (The leaden circles dissolved in the air.) Oh these parties, he thought; Clarissa's parties. Why does she give these parties, he thought. Not that he blamed her or this effigy of a man in a tail-coat with a carnation in his buttonhole coming towards him. Only one person in the world could be as he was, in love. And there he was, this fortunate man, himself, reflected in the plate-glass window of a motor-car manufacturer in Victoria Street. All India lay behind him; plains, mountains; epidemics of cholera; a district twice as big as Ireland; decisions he had come to alone -- he, Peter Walsh; who was now really for the first time in his life, in love. Clarissa had grown hard, he thought; and a trifle sentimental into the bargain, he suspected, looking at the great motor-cars capable of doing -- how many miles on how many gallons? For he had a turn for mechanics; had invented a plough in his district, had ordered wheel-barrows from England, but the coolies wouldn't use them, all of which Clarissa knew nothing whatever about.</div>

Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame. Where there is nothing, Peter Walsh said to himself; feeling hollowed out, utterly empty within. Clarissa refused me, he thought. He stood there thinking, Clarissa refused me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The way she said "Here is my Elizabeth!"-- that annoyed him. Why not "Here's Elizabeth" simply? It was insincere. And Elizabeth didn't like it either. (Still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him; the half-hour; still early; only half-past eleven still.) For he understood young people; he liked them. There was always something cold in Clarissa, he thought. She had always, even as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes conventionality, and then it's all up, it's all up, he thought, looking rather drearily into the glassy depths, and wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her; overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool; wept; been emotional; told her everything, as usual, as usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah, said St. Margaret's, like a hostess who comes into her drawing- room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already. I am not late. No, it is precisely half-past eleven, she says. Yet, though she is perfectly right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some grief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present. It is half-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret's glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest -- like Clarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with the moment. But what room? What moment? And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking? Then, as the sound of St. Margaret's languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the sound expressed languor and suffering. It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing-room. No! No! he cried. She is not dead! I am not old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending, his future.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not old, or set, or dried in the least. As for caring what they said of him -- the Dalloways, the Whitbreads, and their set, he cared not a straw -- not a straw (though it was true he would have, some time or other, to see whether Richard couldn't help him to some job). Striding, staring, he glared at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge. He had been sent down from Oxford -- true. He had been a Socialist, in some sense a failure -- true. Still the future of civilisation lies, he thought, in the hands of young men like that; of young men such as he was, thirty years ago; with their love of abstract principles; getting books sent out to them all the way from London to a peak in the Himalayas; reading science; reading philosophy. The future lies in the hands of young men like that, he thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">I can't keep up with them, Peter Walsh thought, as they marched up Whitehall, and sure enough, on they marched, past him, past every one, in their steady way, as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly, and life, with its varieties, its irreticences, had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline. One had to respect it; one might laugh; but one had to respect it, he thought. There they go, thought Peter Walsh, pausing at the edge of the pavement; and all the exalted statues, Nelson, Gordon, Havelock, the black, the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them, as if they too had made the same renunciation (Peter Walsh felt he too had made it, the great renunciation), trampled under the same temptations, and achieved at length a marble stare. But the stare Peter Walsh did not want for himself in the least; though he could respect it in others. He could respect it in boys. They don't know the troubles of the flesh yet, he thought, as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the Strand -- all that I've been through, he thought, crossing the road, and standing under Gordon's statue, Gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed,-- poor Gordon, he thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is, thought Peter Walsh, beginning to keep step with them, a very fine training. But they did not look robust. They were weedy for the most part, boys of sixteen, who might, to-morrow, stand behind bowls of rice, cakes of soap on counters.

I haven't felt so young for years! thought Peter, escaping (only of course for an hour or so) from being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs out of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong window. But she's extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking across Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a young woman who, as she passed Gordon's statue, seemed, Peter Walsh thought (susceptible as he was), to shed veil after veil, until she became the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately; merry, but discreet; black, but enchanting.</div>

<div class="line_en">And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except Clarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an island to him, the strangeness of standing alone, alive, unknown, at half-past eleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him. What is it? Where am I? And why, after all, does one do it? he thought, the divorce seeming all moonshine. And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and finally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight; as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues, down which if he chose he might wander.

There was colour in her cheeks; mockery in her eyes; he was an adventurer, reckless, he thought, swift, daring, indeed (landed as he was last night from India) a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned proprieties, yellow dressing-gowns, pipes, fishing-rods, in the shop windows; and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats. He was a buccaneer. On and on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent Street, ahead of him, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement, as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她开心地笑着，穿过了牛津街和大波特兰街，拐进了一条小巷，就在此时，就在此刻，伟大的时刻降临了！她放慢了脚步，打开包，朝他的方向看了一眼，但没有正眼瞧他，这是一个告别的眼神，它总结了整个形势，随后又得意洋洋地将其丢弃，永远丢弃。她把钥匙插入锁眼，打开了门，就此消失了！克拉丽莎的声音响起来：记得我的派对，记得我的派对。这句话鸣响在他的耳畔。眼前的这幢房子是那种庸俗的红房子，花篮垂挂在窗外，隐隐地透露出一股淫邪之气。他的浪漫之旅就此结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, I've had my fun; I've had it, he thought, looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums. And it was smashed to atoms -- his fun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented, this escapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better part of life, he thought -- making oneself up; making her up; creating an exquisite amusement, and something more. But odd it was, and quite true; all this one could never share -- it smashed to atoms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，我已经得到了乐趣，我得到过了，他想，一边抬头望着白天竺葵的花篮在风中摇摆。它被彻底粉碎了——他的乐趣，因为那多半是编造出来的，他自己也很清楚的。它是幻想，与那姑娘的这场邂逅；是编造，就像人们喜欢把生活编造得更美好，他想——给自己编造出一份浪漫，编造出一个美人，编造出一份精美的乐趣，诸如此类。可它也很怪异，而且相当真实。人们从来也无法把它拿出来与人分享——因为它被彻底粉碎了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a splendid morning too. Like the pulse of a perfect heart, life struck straight through the streets. There was no fumbling -- no hesitation. Sweeping and swerving, accurately, punctually, noiselessly, there, precisely at the right instant, the motor-car stopped at the door. The girl, silk-stockinged, feathered, evanescent, but not to him particularly attractive (for he had had his fling), alighted. Admirable butlers, tawny chow dogs, halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing, Peter saw through the opened door and approved of. A splendid achievement in its own way, after all, London; the season; civilisation. Coming as he did from a respectable Anglo-Indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent (it's strange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking India, and empire, and army as he did), there were moments when civilisation, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal possession; moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls in their security. Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought. And the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly admirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one's life, companions in the art of living, who would see one through. What with one thing and another, the show was really very tolerable; and he would sit down in the shade and smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这也是个美好的早晨。如遒劲有力的心跳，大街上涌动着欣欣向荣的生命力。不要再摸索了，不要再犹豫了。就在那一刻，就在那儿，一辆汽车呼啸而来，猛然拐弯，准确地、准时地、悄悄地，停在了一个门口。一个姑娘，穿着长筒丝袜，戴着羽饰，娉娉婷婷地，但对他也没什么特别的魅力（因为他已有过自己的艳遇），走下车来。可敬的管家，中国种的小黄狗，铺着菱形的黑白地砖，飘动着白色百叶的大厅，彼德透过打开的房门看见了这一切，他对此十分赞许。毕竟，伦敦以它独特的方式取得了辉煌的成绩：社交季节，城市文明。他出生于一个可敬的驻印度的英国家庭，他家至少有三代曾管理过那片大陆的事务（多奇怪呀，他想，我竟会有那样的感情，尽管我如此讨厌印度，讨厌帝国，也讨厌军队）。有时候哪怕是这样的一种文明，也会像他的私人物品一般令他觉得亲切，为英国感到骄傲，为管家，为小黄狗，为安全有保障的姑娘。真够荒谬的，但确实是事实，他想。所有的医生们、生意人们、女强人们都在忙着自己的事情，他们遵守时间，小心谨慎，精力充沛，他觉得他们都值得钦佩，都是些好人，你可以把自己的生命托付给他们，他们可以成为和你探讨生活艺术的良师益友，可以和你风雨同舟。这里那里的场景，真的令人非常满意。现在，他要在树荫下坐下来，抽支香烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned; went up the street, thinking to find somewhere to sit, till it was time for Lincoln's Inn -- for Messrs. Hooper and Grateley. Where should he go? No matter. Up the street, then, towards Regent's Park. His boots on the pavement struck out "no matter"; for it was early, still very early.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身，走上大街，想要找个地方坐一坐，直到该去林肯律师协会——胡珀和格雷特利律师事务所——的时候。他该去哪里呢？无所谓。那么，就走上街去，就朝摄政公园走吧。他的皮靴在地面上橐橐地敲击出“无所谓”三个字，因为时辰还早，还早得很哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes, he remembered Regent's Park; the long straight walk; the little house where one bought air-balls to the left; an absurd statue with an inscription somewhere or other. He looked for an empty seat. He did not want to be bothered (feeling a little drowsy as he did) by people asking him the time. An elderly grey nurse, with a baby asleep in its perambulator -- that was the best he could do for himself; sit down at the far end of the seat by that nurse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，他还记得摄政公园：那条笔直的、悠长的人行道，人们在那里买气球的位于左侧的小房子，在某个地方还有座刻着铭文的傻乎乎的雕塑。他在寻找一张空凳子。他不愿意有人上前来问他时间（他感觉有点昏昏欲睡），来打搅他。一位白发苍苍的老保姆，带着个睡在童车里的小宝宝——那是他能找到的最佳位子了，他在老保姆坐着的那张长椅的另一头坐下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was Regent's Park. Yes. As a child he had walked in Regent's Park -- odd, he thought, how the thought of childhood keeps coming back to me -- the result of seeing Clarissa, perhaps; for women live much more in the past than we do, he thought. They attach themselves to places; and their fathers -- a woman's always proud of her father. Bourton was a nice place, a very nice place, but I could never get on with the old man, he thought. There was quite a scene one night -- an argument about something or other, what, he could not remember. Politics presumably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿是摄政公园。不错，他小时候在摄政公园里散过步——多奇怪，他想，童年的情景总会回到我的脑海里——也许是因为见到了克拉丽莎的缘故，因为女人比男人更容易沉湎于过去，他寻思。她们喜欢把自己和地点联系在一起，还有她们的父亲——女人总是为自己的父亲骄傲。伯尔顿是个好地方，一个非常好的地方，但我永远也无法和她的老头子搞好关系，他想。有天晚上我和克拉丽莎吵得简直不可开交——为了什么事吵了起来，到底为了啥，他记不起来了。想必是关于政治吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She's a queer-looking girl, he thought, suddenly remembering Elizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother. Grown big; quite grown-up, not exactly pretty; handsome rather; and she can't be more than eighteen. Probably she doesn't get on with Clarissa. "There's my Elizabeth"-- that sort of thing -- why not "Here's Elizabeth" simply?-- trying to make out, like most mothers, that things are what they're not. She trusts to her charm too much, he thought. She overdoes it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是个长相古怪的姑娘，他想，他突然想起伊丽莎白走进房间站在她母亲旁边的那一幕。她个子高大，几乎已是个成熟女人了，不能算严格意义上的美女，但也相当漂亮了，她肯定还未满十八岁。她或许和克拉丽莎处不好。“这是我的伊丽莎白”——那种说法——为什么不简单地说“这是伊丽莎白”呢？——是为了向人家证明，她们母女关系没什么不好，就像大多数母亲的做法一样。克拉丽莎过分相信自己的魅力了，他想，她太自负了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat; he puffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a moment; blue, circular -- I shall try and get a word alone with Elizabeth to-night, he thought -- then began to wobble into hour- glass shapes and taper away; odd shapes they take, he thought. Suddenly he closed his eyes, raised his hand with an effort, and threw away the heavy end of his cigar. A great brush swept smooth across his mind, sweeping across it moving branches, children's voices, the shuffle of feet, and people passing, and humming traffic, rising and falling traffic. Down, down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep, sank, and was muffled over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="味道醇厚的雪茄烟被他舒舒服服地吸进了喉咙，然后又一圈圈地吐出来，刹那间放肆地迎着空气而上，蓝色的，圆形的——我要试一下，今晚要单独和伊丽莎白谈一谈，彼德心里盘算着——然后摇晃着变成为沙漏形，渐渐消失。它们的形状多奇怪呀，他想。他突然闭上眼睛，奋力举起手来，把粗壮的雪茄烟蒂扔掉了。一把大刷子柔和地拂过他的大脑，将摇曳的树枝、孩子的声音、沉重的脚步、过往的路人、辚辚的车流声，将所有的一切统统扫入他的脑海。他不断下沉、下沉，沉入了羽毛般柔软的梦乡中，沉入了酣甜之乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
