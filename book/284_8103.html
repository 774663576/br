<div class="line_cn" title="“我要走到那个树那里，”他说，指着几英尺（1英尺=0.305米）外的一棵树，“老季进来的时候我要站着。要是我想，可以靠在树上休息。等我想坐了就坐下，但是不是在我想坐之前。从椅子上拿条毯子来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully steady. When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that he supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight that he looked tall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走向那棵树，虽然迪肯搀着他的胳膊，他完全稳当。当他靠树干站着，不是太明显他靠它支撑，他仍然保持直立，看着很高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! You can do it! You can!" She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep him on his feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should give in before Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted by a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness. He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能行！你能行！我告诉过你能行！你能行！你能行！你行！”她在对柯林说，因为她想制造魔法，让他用自己的脚站着，就像那样。要是他在季元本面前屈服，她不能忍受。她突然精神一振：虽然他很瘦，看上去仍然很美。他把眼睛盯上了季元本，带着一种可笑的皇帝做派。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understanding in his manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could as they had come down the Long Walk.

<div class="line_en">On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretched out his hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and he began to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough but presently as they watched him -- Mary with quite breathless interest -- he drove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽把泥刀扔在树下的草地上。柯林伸出手拿起来。一个奇怪的表情来到他的脸上，他开始挖土。他的瘦手够弱的，可是现在当他们看着他——玛丽带着令人屏息的兴趣——他把泥刀尖推进土里，翻转了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Colin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke exultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire. "Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk -- an' tha' said tha'd have me diggin'. I thowt tha' was just leein' to please me. This is th' first day an' I've walked -- an' here I am diggin'."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his way forgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it. Mary slipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had deepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over. He looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new exercise, slight as it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实很快就办了。季元本一路走去，忘了风湿。迪肯拿铁锹挖了个坑，比一个双手瘦弱雪白的新手能挖的要深，要大。玛丽溜出去跑去拿来一个水壶。等迪肯加深了坑，柯林接着把柔软的泥土翻了又翻。他抬头看天，脸红、发光，因为奇怪的新型锻炼，尽管锻炼很轻巧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on purpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the greenhouse. He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could. He had begun to be excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from the mould.</div>

<div class="line_en">The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.

Nut and Shell chattered about it from a cherry-tree.</div>
