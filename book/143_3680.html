<div class="line_en">But the mountain air was deceiving. It would take two hours to make his way down to the town and four hours to get back up. Guiliano and Pisciotta had played here as children; they knew every rock on this mountain and every cave and every tunnel. Further back on this cliff was the Grotta Bianca, the favorite cave of their childhood, bigger than any house in Montelepre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是在大山里，空间是具有欺骗性的。从山上走下去到镇里需要两个小时，从山下走上来却需要四个小时。吉里安诺和皮肖塔从小就在这里玩耍，他们对山上的每一块岩石、每一个洞穴和每一条隧道都了如指掌。比安卡洞就在这块悬崖上，那是他们最喜欢去的地方，里面的空间比蒙特莱普雷任何一幢房子都大。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From a jutting cliff edge near the top of Monte d'Ora, Guiliano and Pisciotta could look down on the town of Montelepre. Only a few miles below them, the house lights were coming on to fight the falling darkness. Guiliano even imagined he could hear the music coming from the loudspeakers in the square, which always played Rome radio station broadcasts to serenade the town's strollers before their evening meal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aspanu had followed his orders well, Turi Guiliano thought. The cave was stocked with sleeping bags, cooking pans, boxes of ammunition and sacks of food and bread. There was a wooden box holding flashlights, lanterns and knives, and there were also some cans of kerosene. He laughed. "Aspanu, we can live up here forever."</div>

<div class="line_en">A great cloak of darkness had fallen over the mountains, but the sky was so full of stars that they could see each other clearly. Pisciotta opened the duffel bag and started pulling out weapons and clothes. Slowly and ceremonially, Turi Guiliano armed himself. Taking off his monk's cassock, he donned the moleskin trousers, then the huge sheepskin jacket with its many pockets. He put two pistols in his waistband and strapped the machine pistol inside the jacket so it could be covered and yet swung into action immediately. He buckled an ammunition belt around his waist and put extra boxes of bullets in the jacket pockets. Pisciotta handed him a knife, which he put in the army boots he had drawn on. Then another small pistol, which fit into a string holster tied into the inside of the collar flap of the sheepskin jacket. He checked all the guns and ammunition carefully.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano was still smiling, the secret smile of a child who believes he has the world at bay. The huge scar on his body ached with the weight of the weapons and ammunition, but he welcomed that ache. It gave him absolution. "I'm ready to see my family or meet my enemies," he said to Pisciotta. The two young men started down the long winding path from the top of Monte d'Ora to the town of Montelepre below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺依然在微笑，就像一个孩子相信自己的诡计得逞之后的窃笑。武器和弹药的重量压得他身上那个大伤疤隐隐作痛，但是他需要这样的疼痛，因为这使他感到一种赦罪的解脱。“我做好了两手准备，不是与家人见上一面，就是与敌人狭路相逢。”他对皮肖塔说。两个年轻人踏上从德奥拉山山顶通向蒙特莱普雷那条蜿蜒而漫长的小路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rifle he carried openly, its sling over his shoulder. Finally he was ready. He smiled at Pisciotta, who carried only a lupara out in the open and his knife in a holster at his back. Pisciotta said, "I feel naked. Can you walk with all that iron on your body? If you fall down I'll never be able to lift you up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那支步枪他就公然斜挎在肩上。在终于装束齐备之后，他对皮肖塔微微一笑。皮肖塔仅背着一把短筒猎枪，他把小刀插在背后的刀鞘里。“我觉得自己像没穿衣服一样，”皮肖塔说，“你身上带那么多钢铁玩意儿还能走路吗？你要是摔倒了，我可扶不动你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked below a vault of stars. Armed against death and his fellow man, drinking in the smell of far-off lemon orchards and wild flowers, Turi Guiliano felt a serenity he had never known. He was no longer helpless against some random foe. He no longer had to entertain the enemy within himself that doubted his courage. If he had willed himself not to die, had willed his torn body to knit together, he now believed that he could make his body do this over and over again. He no longer doubted that he had some magnificent destiny before him. He shared the magic of those medieval heroes who could not die until they came to the end of their long story, until they had achieved their great victories.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在缀满繁星的天幕下行走，身上的装备足以抵抗死亡和敌人，图里闻到远处果园里飘来的柠檬清香以及野花的扑鼻香气，感到一种从未有过的静谧。面对不期而遇的仇敌，他再也不会那样无可奈何，再也不必质疑自己的勇气。他以坚强意志战胜死神，让受重伤的身体得以康复，他相信自己的身体一定能反复经受这样的磨难。他相信等待他的是一番宏图伟业，像神奇的中世纪英雄那样，在取得了辉煌的胜利之后，才会走向漫长的人生尽头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were coming down out of the mountains now and onto the roads that lead to Montelepre. They passed a padlocked roadside shrine of the Virgin Mary and child, the blue plaster robes shining like the sea in moonlight. The smell of the orchards filled the air with a sweetness that made Guiliano almost dizzy. He saw Pisciotta stoop and pick a prickly pear made sweet by the night air, and he felt a love for this friend who had saved his life, a love with its root in their childhood spent together. He wanted to share his immortality with him. It was never their fate to die two nameless peasants on a mountainside in Sicily. In a great exuberance of spirit Guiliano called out, "Aspanu, Aspanu, I believe, I believe," and started running down the final slope of the mountain, out of the ghostly white rocks, past the holy shrines of Christ and martyred saints standing in padlocked boxes. Pisciotta ran beside him, laughing, and they raced together into the arc of moonlight that showered the road to Montelepre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻他们已经走出大山，踏上了通往蒙特莱普雷的道路。他们路过一个神龛，神龛中的圣母玛利亚手抱孩子，身上那件蓝色石膏长袍就像月光下闪烁的海面。空气中弥漫着果园散发的香甜味，使吉里安诺如痴如醉。他看见皮肖塔弯腰摘了一个在夜晚的空气中发出甜味的仙人果。他由衷地热爱这个救过他性命的朋友，这种感情植根于他们共同度过的童年。他想与他分享自己的神奇力量。他们绝对不会无声无息地死在西西里的一个山坡上，他们的命运不会如此。吉里安诺兴奋地大喊起来：“阿斯帕努，阿斯帕努，我相信，我相信。”接着便从最后一截山坡跑下去，从耶稣和其他死难圣贤的神龛前跑过去，离开了幽灵般的白色山岩。皮肖塔在他身边奔跑，并发出阵阵笑声。他们一起跑上通向蒙特莱普雷那条洒满月光的道路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now nearly midnight, the moon still bright, and they hurried into the house to escape observation by spies. The windows were shuttered, and relatives of the Guiliano and Pisciotta families had been posted along all the streets to warn of police patrols. In the house Guiliano's friends and family waited to celebrate his homecoming. A feast worthy of Holy Easter had been laid out. They had this one night with him before Turi went to live in the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时已近午夜，月光依然皎洁。他们匆匆走进屋内，以免被监视的人看见。窗户上的百叶窗帘是放下的，吉里安诺和皮肖塔两家的亲戚都分布在各条街上望风，只要发现巡逻警察就会随时通报。屋子里，吉里安诺的朋友和家人等着为他庆贺。他们摆了一桌可以与复活节大餐媲美的酒席。今晚他们与他相聚，今后他就要生活在大山里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mountains ended in a hundred yards of green pasture that led to the back walls formed by the houses on the Via Bella. Behind these walls, each house had its garden of tomatoes, and some, a lonely olive or lemon tree. The gate to the Guiliano garden fence was unlocked, and the two young men slipped through quietly and found Guiliano's mother waiting for them. She rushed into Turi Guiliano's arms, the tears streaming down her face. She kissed him fiercely and whispered, "My beloved son, my beloved son," and Turi Guiliano found himself standing in the moonlight not responding to her love for the first time in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山路尽头是一片牧场，百米开外就是贝拉大街上那些房子的后墙。在这些墙后边是每家每户种植西红柿的菜园，有的园子里还有一棵橄榄树或者柠檬树。吉里安诺家园子的篱笆没有上锁，两个年轻人悄悄溜进去后，发现吉里安诺的母亲正在等他们。她跑向吉里安诺张开的双臂，泪水像断线的珠子直往下掉。她热烈地亲吻儿子并小声说：“我的心肝，我的儿子。”图里发现自己站在月光下，有生以来第一次没有回应母亲的爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano's father embraced him and slapped him on the back to show his approval. His two sisters were there, and Hector Adonis. Also there was a neighbor, a woman called La Venera. She was a widow of about thirty-five. Her husband had been a famous bandit named Candeleria, who had been betrayed, then ambushed by the police, only a year ago. She had become a close friend of Guiliano's mother, but Turi was surprised that she was present at this reunion. Only his mother could have invited her. For a moment he wondered why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺的父亲与儿子拥抱，并用手拍拍他的后背表示赞赏。在场的有他的两个姐姐，还有赫克特·阿多尼斯，此外还有一个叫拉韦内拉的邻家妇女，是个约摸三十五岁的寡妇。她丈夫叫坎德列里亚，是个赫赫有名的土匪，一年前因被人出卖，遭到警察伏击。她成了吉里安诺母亲的挚友。但是看见她出现在聚会中，吉里安诺颇为惊讶，只有他母亲才会邀请她。一时之下，他弄不清是为什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They ate and drank and treated Turi Guiliano as if he had returned from a long holiday in foreign countries. But then his father wanted to see his wound. Guiliano lifted his shirt out of his trousers and revealed the great flaming scar, the tissue around it still blue-black from the trauma of the gunshot. His mother broke into lamentations. Guiliano said to her with a smile, "Would you rather have seen me in prison with the marks of the bastinado?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃饭时，他们频频举杯，为吉里安诺接风，好像他刚从国外度长假回来。不过他父亲想看看他的伤口。吉里安诺把衬衣从裤子里拉出，露出了一块肉红色的大伤疤，伤口四周的组织依然呈现出枪伤造成的青紫。他母亲伤心得哭起来。吉里安诺微笑着对她说：“难道你愿意看到我蹲大牢，留下受杖刑的疤痕？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though the familiar scene duplicated the happiest days of his childhood, he felt a great distance from them all. There were all his favorite dishes, the inky squid, the fat macaroni with its herbed sauce of tomato, the roasted lamb, the great bowl of olives, green and red salad doused with the pure first pressing of olive oil, bamboo-covered bottles of Sicilian wine. Everything from the earth of Sicily. His mother and father told their fairy tales about life in America. And Hector Adonis regaled them on the glories of the history of Sicily. Of Garibaldi and his famous Redshirts. Of the day of the Sicilian Vespers, when the people of Sicily had risen to slaughter the French occupying army so many hundreds of years ago. All the tales of Sicily oppressed starting with Rome, followed by the Moors and Normans and the French and the Germans and the Spanish. Woe was Sicily! Never free, its people always hungry, their labor sold so cheap, their blood spilled so easily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺很熟悉眼前这个场面，觉得它就像他儿时经历的最高兴的日子一样，但他觉得自己与他们之间已然有了很大的距离。桌上都是他喜欢吃的，有墨鱼、番茄酱汁粗通心面、烤羊羔、一大碗橄榄果、初榨纯橄榄油调制的红绿色拉、竹篓瓶装酒，总之，西西里产的好东西应有尽有。吉里安诺的父母亲讲述了他们在美国生活的那段童话般的经历。赫克特·阿多尼斯则大谈西西里历史上的辉煌：加里波第2和红衫军，西西里晚祈祷事件3。历史上，最早压迫西西里人的是罗马人，随后是摩尔人、诺曼人、法国人、德国人、西班牙人。西西里的历史充满了辛酸！它从来就没有自由，劳动力被贱卖，流血冲突是家常便饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

He saw that her face was still handsome, bold and strong with jet-black eyebrows and lips so dark and red that they seemed almost purple in this smoky curtained light. There was no way to tell what her figure was like, for she wore the Sicilian widow's shapeless black dress.</div>

<div class="line_en">He watched Aspanu smoking a cigarette over his coffee. Even at this joyful reunion, Aspanu had an ironic smile on his lips. Guiliano could tell what he was thinking and what he would say later: All you have to do is to be stupid enough to get shot by a policeman, commit murder, become an outlaw, and then your loved ones will show their affection and treat you like a saint from heaven. And yet Aspanu was the only one he did not feel cut off from.</div>

His father, a little drunk with wine, emitted growls of approval at the death of the policeman. His mother was silent. His father told the story of how the farmer had come looking for his donkey and his own remark to the farmer: "Stay content you have lost a donkey. I have lost a son."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图里·吉里安诺不得不把在四岔路口发生的枪击事件一五一十地告诉他们。他父亲此时已有几分醉意，听到警察被打死的时候，大声吼叫着表示赞赏。他母亲则一言不发。他父亲说那个农民来找他来要驴子，他对那个农民说：“得了吧，你失去的不过是驴子，我失去的可是儿子啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally Hector Adonis outlined his plans to save Turi. The family of the dead man would be paid an indemnity. Guiliano's parents would have to mortgage their little piece of land to raise the money. Adonis himself would contribute a sum. But this tactic would have to wait until feelings of anger had died down. The influence of the great Don Croce would be brought to bear on government officials and the family of the slain man. After all it had been more or less an accident. There had been no real ill will on either side. A farce could be played out as long as the victim's family and key government officials cooperated. The only drawback was the identity card at the scene of the killing. But in a year's time Don Croce could cause that to vanish from the prosecutor's files. Most important, Turi Guiliano must remain out of trouble for that year. He must disappear into the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，赫克特·阿多尼斯大致讲了帮助图里的计划。吉里安诺的父母要抵押土地，筹措资金赔偿死者家属。阿多尼斯本人将捐赠一笔钱，但是这一切要等到对方怒气平息之后，让唐·克罗切向政府官员和死者家属施压。这毕竟可以是个偶然事故，双方都没有真正的恶意，只要死者家属和政府一些要员合作，就可能上演一出闹剧。唯一不利的就是杀人现场的那张身份证。但是一年之后，唐·克罗切就能使它从被告的档案中消失。更重要的是，图里·吉里安诺这一年不能出事。他必须隐身匿迹于大山之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

He could not eat. He could not sleep. When we were in bed together every little noise would make him jump. We slept with guns on the floor beside the bed. But that didn't help him.

<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano watched all this with interest. The police raid was based on the assumption that the targets would never be in a position to launch a counterattack; that their only alternative would be to run from a superior force.

<div class="line_cn" title="图里·吉里安诺把一切都看在眼里，觉得很有意思。警察的袭击是基于这样的设想：目标根本不可能实施反击，面临占优势的对手，他们唯一的选择就是避其锋芒。也就是在这时候，图里·吉里安诺确立了一条基本原则，那就是，在受到追捕时，一定要处于能进行反击的位置，不论力量强弱多悬殊，也许差距大了反而更好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was Guiliano's first tactical operation and he was astonished at how easily he could command the situation if he chose to shed blood.

But he could easily slaughter the two men commanding the street and the two drivers in their vehicles. If he wished, he could do this as soon as the Maresciallo and his men were in the Guiliano house. They would not dare come out, and he and Pisciotta could make their way through the fields at their leisure.

As if he could have been caught in such a trap. What could they have been thinking of? Was that a sample of official cleverness? He switched to another side street to bring him to the back entrance of the church that dominated the square, Pisciotta following him. Inside, they both vaulted the altar rail and then both stopped for a fraction of a second on the holy stage where long ago they had performed as altar boys and served their priest while he was giving the people of Montelepre Sunday Mass and Communion. Holding their guns at the ready they genuflected and crossed themselves clumsily; for a moment the power of the wax statues of Christ crowned with thorns, the gilded chalky blue-robed Virgin Marys, the batteries of saints blunted their lust for battle.

At the same moment he fired his machine pistol into the blocking van, aiming at the tires and the engine. Suddenly the square flamed with light as the engine blew up and the van caught fire. The two carabinieri in the front seat tumbled out like loose-jointed puppets, their surprise not giving their bodies time to tighten against the shock. Beside him Pisciotta was firing his rifle at the cab of the truck holding the prisoners. Turi Guiliano saw the driver leap out and fall still. The other armed carabinieri jumped out and Pisciotta fired again. The second policeman went down. Turi turned to Pisciotta to reproach him but suddenly the stained glass windows of the church shattered with machine gun fire and the colored bits scattered on the church floor like rubies.
