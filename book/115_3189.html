<div class="line_en">We watched the car disappear round the sweep of the drive, and then Maxim took my arm and said, "Thank God that's that. Get a coat quickly, and come out. Damn the rain, I want a walk. I can't stand this sitting about." He looked white and strained, and I wondered why the entertaining of Beatrice and Giles, his own sister and brother-in-law, should have tired him so.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robert came running out of the hall carrying a raincoat, and I struggled into it hurriedly, fumbling with the collar. It was too big, of course, and too long, but there was no time to change it, and we set off together across the lawn to the woods, Jasper running in front.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗伯特抱着一件雨衣从屋子里奔出来。我匆匆把它套上，胡乱拉了拉领子。雨衣显然太大又太长，可是没时间再去换一件了。就这样，我们穿过草坪向林子走去，杰斯珀在前开路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait while I run upstairs for my coat," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower-room, get one of them," he said impatiently, "women are always half an hour when they go to their bedrooms. Robert, fetch a coat from the flower-room, will you, for Mrs de Winter? There must be half a dozen raincoats hanging there left by people at one time or another." He was already standing in the drive, and calling to Jasper, "Come on, you lazy little beggar, and take some of that fat off." Jasper ran round in circles, barking hysterically at the prospect of his walk. "Shut up, you idiot," said Maxim. "What on earth is Robert doing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不耐烦地说：“花房里有一大堆胶布雨衣，随便穿上一件得了。女人一进卧室，不拖上半个钟头就不肯出来。罗伯特，到花房去给德温特夫人拿件雨衣来。好吗？人们前前后后丢在那里的雨衣起码总有六七件。”说着，他已站在车道上，一边招呼杰斯珀：“过来，你这小懒鬼，走，去遛遛腿，跑掉点脂肪。”杰斯珀绕着他的脚跟打转，因为就要出发去溜达而激动得汪汪直叫。迈克西姆说：“住嘴，傻瓜！这个罗伯特，怎么磨蹭个没完？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We climbed the grass bank above the lawns, and plunged into the woods. The trees grew very close together, and it was dark. We trod upon broken twigs, and last year's leaves, and here and there the fresh green stubble of the young bracken, and the shoots of the bluebells soon to blossom. Jasper was silent now, his nose to the ground. I took Maxim's arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们登上草坪边上的草坡，钻进林子。树木长得很密，林子里十分幽暗。我们踏过断技残叶，不时还踩上刚刚露头的羊齿嫩绿的梗茎和行将开花的野风信子的新枝。此刻，杰斯珀已变得很老实，不住地用鼻子嗅着地面。我挽起迈克西姆的手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="看来，这会儿他又恢复发了常态，神情轻松愉快。这才是我所了解并深爱着的迈克西姆。他开始谈到总管事弗兰克—克劳利，说这个人怎么怎么好，多么周到，何其可靠，对曼陀丽确是赤胆忠心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She must know him, of course; she was his sister. But it was not what I had thought; it was not my idea of Maxim. I could see him moody, difficult, irritable perhaps, but not angry as she had inferred, not passionate. Perhaps she had exaggerated; people very often were wrong about their relatives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，她是了解他的，毕竟是姐姐嘛！可她说的这些与我理想中的迈克西姆不是一回事。我能够想象他郁郁寡欢，跟人闹别扭的样子，也许有时脾气也很急躁；可我无法想象她话里所暗示的迈克西姆：金刚怒目，大发雷霆。也许她在夸张，人们对于自己亲人的看法往往是不正确的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is better," I thought; "this is like it was in Italy", and I smiled up at him, squeezing his arm, relieved that the odd strained look on his face had passed away, and while I said "Yes," and "Really?" and "Fancy, darling," my thoughts wandered back to Beatrice, wondering why her presence should have disturbed him, what she had done; and I thought too of all she had said about his temper, how he lost it, she told me, about once or twice a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想：“两人这样在一起多好，这才像在意大利度蜜月的那些日子。”我抬头朝他微笑，把他的手臂挽得更紧些。看到他脸上刚才那种反常的疲惫神态渐渐散去，我松了一口气。我一边应着“是的”，“真的吗”，“真想不到，亲爱的”等等，一边却又不由自主地想起比阿特丽斯。姐姐来访为什么使他不高兴呢？她做错了什么事？我还想到她关于迈克西姆的脾气的那些话，说什么他在一年里头总要发作一两次，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There," said Maxim suddenly, "take a look at that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆突然叫起来：“喂，看那边！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We stood on a slope of a wooded hill, and the path wound away before us to a valley, by the side of a running stream.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were no dark trees here, no tangled undergrowth, but on either side of the narrow path stood azaleas and rhododendrons, not blood-coloured like the giants in the drive, but salmon, white, and gold, things of beauty and of grace, drooping their lovely, delicate heads in the soft summer rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿没有黑压压的大树，也没有纷乱交错的矮树丛。小径两边是杜鹃和石南。这儿的石南花与车道上血红色的巨怪也不同，有的呈检红，有的呈白色和金黄，在蒙蒙夏雨之中低垂着婀娜娇柔的花穗，既秀美又优雅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the birds began. First a blackbird, his note clear and cool above the running stream, and after a moment he had answer from his fellow hidden in the woods behind us, and soon the still air about us was made turbulent with song, pursuing us as we wandered down into the valley, and the fragrance of the white petals followed us too. It was disturbing, like an enchanted place. I had not thought it could be as beautiful as this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，鸟儿开始啾鸣。起初是一只画眉，它的歌声清越而爽朗，在泪泪流水之上飘过。过了一会儿，藏在我们背后林子里的鸟儿应和着唱起来，四下的沉寂顿时化作一片嘈杂的鸟语。鸟儿的歌声尾随我们步入山谷；白色花瓣的清香一路伴着我们。这儿简直像个魔境，我不禁一怔。我没想到一切竟是如此之美…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was full of their scent, sweet and heady, and it seemed to me as though their very essence had mingled with the running waters of the stream, and become one with the falling rain and the dank rich moss beneath our feet. There was no sound here but the tumbling of the little stream, and the quiet rain. When Maxim spoke, his voice was hushed too, gentle and low, as if he had no wish to break upon the silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气里洋溢着花香，其甜美熏人欲醉。我觉得鲜花的芬芳仿佛和潺潺的溪水融合在一起，同落地的雨滴以及我们脚下湿漉漉的茂盛的苦薛融成了一体。这儿除了小溪流水声和恬静的雨声，再没有别的声响。迈克西姆说话的时候，把声音压得很低，很轻，仿佛不想去打扰四下的宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We stood quite still, not speaking, looking down upon the clear white faces of the flowers closest to us, and Maxim stooped, and picked up a fallen petal and gave it to me. It was crushed and bruised, and turning brown at the curled edge, but as I rubbed it across my hand the scent rose to me, sweet and strong, vivid as the living tree from which it came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们默不作声地站着，观赏距我们最近的那些洁白的花朵。迈克西姆弯身捡起一片落地花瓣，塞在我手里。花瓣已经压碎，皱卷的边沿处开始变色，可是当我搓着手里的花瓣时，仍然闻到浓香，简直同长在树上那活生生的鲜花没什么两样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We call it the Happy Valley," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky, now overcast and sullen, so changed from the early afternoon, and the steady insistent rain could not disturb the soft quietude of the valley; the rain and the rivulet mingled with one another, and the liquid note of the blackbird fell upon the damp air in harmony with them both. I brushed the dripping heads of azaleas as I passed, so close they grew together, bordering the path. Little drops of water fell on to my hands from the soaked petals. There were petals at my feet too, brown and sodden, bearing their scent upon them still, and a richer, older scent as well, the smell of deep moss and bitter earth, the stems of bracken, and the twisted buried roots of trees. I held Maxim's hand and I had not spoken. The spell of the Happy Valley was upon me. This at last was the core of Manderley, the Manderley I would know and learn to love. The first drive was forgotten, the black, herded woods, the glaring rhododendrons, luscious and overproud. And the vast house too, the silence of that echoing hall, the uneasy stillness of the west wing, wrapped in dust-sheets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空乌云密布，十分阴沉，与午饭后的晴朗相经，大不一样。雨不住地下着，却丝毫不去惊扰山谷的静谧。雨声和溪水声交融在一起，而画眉那婉转的曲调在湿润的空气里回荡，与前面两者非常协调。我一路走去，身子擦过杜鹃往下渐沥滴水的花朵。杜鹃花沿着小径的边沿生长，成簇成团。小水滴从浸湿透了的花瓣里落在我手上。我的脚边也有不少花瓣，因浸泡多时已开始变色，可芳泽犹存，甚至变得更浓郁，同时却又不免带点陈腐。此外，还有多年苔藓的清香，泥土的苦涩味，羊齿梗和扭曲入地的树根的气息。我紧紧抓着迈克西姆的手，不敢出声。幸福谷的魔力把我整个儿摄住了。这儿才是曼陀丽的精随，我将熟识这个地方，并逐渐爱上它。站在这儿，我忘记了给我留下第一个印象的车道，忘记了黑糊糊的密林，和那色彩过于俗艳、姿态过于矜持、冲着你瞪眼的石南花。此外，我也忘了曼陀丽大宅，忘了那回响着脚步声的肃穆的大厅和蒙着罩单的哑寂的西侧厢房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim smiled down at me, watching the bewilderment on my face. "It's a shock, isn't it?" he said; "no one ever expects it. The contrast is too sudden; it almost hurts." He picked up a stone and flung it across the beach for Jasper. "Fetch it, good man," and Jasper streaked away in search of the stone, his long black ears flapping in the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆低头看着我脸上痴狂的表情，微微一笑。他说：“太美了，对吗？谁都没想到在这儿会突然见到大海。景色的骤变出人意料，甚至有点惊心动魄哩。”她拾起一块石子，丢到海滩那一头，让杰斯珀去追逐。小狗飞奔而去，它那黑色的长耳朵在风中啪啪扇动着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We came to the end of the path, and the flowers formed an archway above our heads. We bent down, passing underneath, and when I stood straight again, brushing the raindrops from my hair, I saw that the valley was behind us, and the azaleas, and the trees, and, as Maxim had described to me that afternoon many weeks ago in Monte Carlo, we were standing in a little narrow cove, the shingle hard and white under our feet, and the sea was breaking on the shore beyond us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走到小径的尽头，鲜花在我们头顶构成拱形，我们不得不弓着腰从下边钻过去。当我再次站直身子，抹去头发上的雨珠时，我发现幸福谷已同杜鹃花和树林一起被抛在后头。好几个星期前的一个下午，迈克西姆在蒙特卡洛曾对我描绘过这儿的景色。一点不错，我们此刻正站在一个狭小的海湾上，脚下是坚硬的白色圆卵石。再过去一点，流潮冲刷着海岸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The enchantment was no more, the spell was broken. We were mortal again, two people playing on a beach. We threw more stones, went to the water's edge, flung ducks and drakes, and fished for driftwood. The tide had turned, and came lapping in the bay. The small rocks were covered, the seaweed washed on the stones. We rescued a big floating plank and carried it up the beach above high-water mark. Maxim turned to me, laughing, wiping the hair out of his eyes, and I unrolled the sleeves of my mackintosh caught by the sea spray. And then we looked round, and saw that Jasper had disappeared. We called and whistled, and he did not come. I looked anxiously towards the mouth of the cove where the waves were breaking upon the rocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，我俩不再痴狂出神，就好像魔法突然被解除了，我俩又变成在海滨嬉戏的普通凡人。我俩走到水边又扔出不少石片，看它们在水面上漂削而过；我们伸手到水里去捞取随波逐流的木片。涨潮了！波浪冲进海湾。小礁岩顿时被海水淹没，流潮带着水草，冲上岩石。我们捞起一块漂浮的木板，把它拖上岸，搁在满潮水标上方。迈克西姆大笑着向我转过身来，把技在眼睛处的头发掠上去。我卷起被海水打湿的胶布雨衣袖子。接着，我们回头四望，这才发现杰斯珀不见了。我们吆喝着，打着唿哨，可小狗还是没有出现。我焦急地朝海湾口子望去，只见潮水冲刷着礁岩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There I was an interloper, wandering in rooms that did not know me, sitting at a desk and in a chair that were not mine. Here it was different. The Happy Valley knew no trespassers.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the distance, beyond the rocks to the right of the beach, I heard a short, sharp bark. "Hear that?" I said. "He's climbed over this way." I began to scramble up the slippery rocks in the direction of the bark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远远地，从海滩右边的礁石堆背后传来一声短促而凶恶的狗吠声。我对迈克西姆说：“听见吗？它从它儿翻越到那边去了。”说着，我便爬上那些滑溜溜的礁岩，朝狗吠方向赶去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hesitated, looked down from my rock. "Perhaps he's fallen," I said, "poor little chap. Let me fetch him." Jasper barked again, further away this time. "Oh, listen," I said, "I must get him. It's quite safe, isn't it? The tide won't have cut him off?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站在礁岩上，往下张望，迟疑着说：“也许它摔下去了。可怜的小家伙，让我去把它带过来。”这时候，杰斯珀的吠声再次传来，不过，这回像是离得更远。我接着说：“啊，你听。我得把它叫回来，该不会有危险吧？潮水不会把它隔绝在那一边吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Maxim, "we should have seen him, he can't have fallen. Jasper, you idiot, where are you? Jasper, Jasper?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆说：“不会的，要是被海水卷走，我们肯定会看见的；它不会掉进大海。杰斯珀，你这个笨蛋，你在哪里？杰斯珀！杰斯珀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I pretended not to hear, and began scrambling over the rocks towards Jasper. Great jagged boulders screened the view, and I slipped and stumbled on the wet rocks, making my way as best I could in Jasper's direction. It was heartless of Maxim to leave Jasper, I thought, and I could not understand it. Besides, the tide was coming in. I came up beside the big boulder that had hidden the view, and looked beyond it. And I saw, to my surprise, that I was looking down into another cove, similar to the one I had left, but wider and more rounded. A small stone breakwater had been thrown out across the cove for shelter, and behind it the bay formed a tiny natural harbour.</div>

There must have been a garden once, but now the grass was long and overgrown, crowded with nettles. The windows were boarded up. No doubt the door was locked, and I lifted the latch without much hope. To my surprise it opened after the first stiffness, and I went inside, bending my head because of the low door. I expected to find the usual boat store, dirty and dusty with disuse, ropes and blocks and oars upon the floor. The dust was there, and the dirt too in places, but there were no ropes or blocks. The room was furnished, and ran the whole length of the cottage. There was a desk in the corner, a table, and chairs, and a bed-sofa pushed against the wall. There was a dresser too, with cups and plates.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bookshelves, the books inside them, and models of ships standing on the top of the shelves. For a moment I thought it must be inhabited -- perhaps the poor man on the beach lived here -- but I looked around me again and saw no sign of recent occupation. That rusted grate knew no fire, this dusty floor no footsteps, and the china there on the dresser was blue-spotted with the damp. There was a queer musty smell about the place. Cobwebs spun threads upon the ships' models, making their own ghostly rigging. No one lived here. No one came here.</div>

A ball of twine lay on a shelf, a rusted clasp knife beside it. This would be all I needed for Jasper. I opened the knife, and cut a length of twine, and came back into the room again. The rain still fell upon the roof, and into the grate.</div>

She who had worn the coat then was tall, slim, broader than me about the shoulders, for I had found it big and overlong, and the sleeves had come below my wrist. Some of the buttons were missing.

<div class="line_en">I felt very weary now, very tired in a dull, spent way. I looked at Maxim but he was reading his paper, he had folded it over to another page. My fingers were messy with the butter from the crumpet, and I felt in my pocket for a handkerchief. I drew it out, a tiny scrap of a thing, lace-edged. I stared at it, frowning, for it was not mine. I remembered then that Frith had picked it up from the stone floor of the hall. It must have fallen out of the pocket in the mackintosh. I turned it over in my hand. It was grubby; little bits of fluff from the pocket clung to it. It must have been in the mackintosh pocket for a long time. There was a monogram in the corner. A tall sloping R, with the letters de W interlaced. The R dwarfed the other letters, the tail of it ran down into the cambric, away from the laced edge. It was only a small handkerchief, quite a scrap of a thing. It had been rolled in a ball and put away in the pocket and forgotten.</div>
