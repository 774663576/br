<div class="line_en">"Come on," said Aravis, who was trembling herself. "They've gone back to the new palace. Once we're out of this room we're safe enough. But it's wasted a terrible time. Get me down to that water-gate as quick as you can."</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the end she had to give in to Aravis. She led the way down the steps they had already descended, and along another corridor and so finally out into the open air. They were now in the palace garden which sloped down in terraces to the city wall. The moon shone brightly. One of the drawbacks about adventures is that when you come to the most beautiful places you are often too anxious and hurried to appreciate them; so that Aravis (though she remembered them years later) had only a vague impression of grey lawns, quietly bubbling fountains, and the long black shadows of cypress trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但最后她还是不得不向阿拉维斯屈服了。她带路走下她们刚才下去过的石级，沿着另一条通道走去，终于走到了空旷的地方。现在她们是在御花园里了，花园的一层层台地迤逦而下，直达城墙。月亮明朗地照耀着。冒险行动中的一大缺憾是：当你来到最美丽的地方时，你往往太焦急、太匆忙，无法欣赏当前美景，所以，阿拉维斯只有一个模模糊糊的印象（虽然几年后还记得很劳）：银灰色的草地，安静的泪泪流动的泉水，以及柏树的长长的黑色阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they reached the very bottom and the wall rose frowning above them, Lasaraleen was shaking so that she could not unbolt the gate. Aravis did it. There, at last, was the river, full of reflected moonlight, and a little landing stage and a few pleasure boats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她们到达山麓，墙垣颦眉皱额地耸立在她们面前时，拉斯阿拉莉恩浑身发抖，无力打开水门上的门闩。阿拉维斯把门打开。最后终于看到了河流，河上到处反照着月光，还有一个小小的码头，几艘游艇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She tore herself away from her friend's affectionate embraces, stepped into a punt, cast off, and a moment later was out in midstream with a huge real moon overhead and a huge reflected moon down, deep down, in the river. The air was fresh and cool and as she drew near the farther bank she heard the hooting of an owl. "Ah! That's better!" thought Aravis. She had always lived in the country and had hated every minute of her time in Tashbaan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从朋友的多情拥抱中挣脱出来，踏上一条方头平底船，用篙子把船撑离河岸，一会儿船就到了河中！司。头上是一轮巨大的真正的明月，河底深处是一个巨大明月的倒影。空气新鲜而凉爽，船靠近对岸时，她听到了一只猫头鹰的叫声。“啊！好极了。”她一直生活在乡村里，因此憎恨她住在塔什班城里的每一分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she stepped ashore she found herself in darkness for the rise of the ground, and the trees, cut off the moonlight. But she managed to find the same road that Shasta had found, and came just as he had done to the end of. the grass and the beginning of the sand, and looked (like him) to her left and saw the big, black Tombs. And now at last, brave girl though she was, her heart quailed. Supposing the others weren't there! Supposing the ghouls were! But she stuck out her chin (and a little bit of her tongue too) and went straight towards them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她登上对岸时，由于地势上升，树木遮住了月光，她觉得自己置身于黑暗之中了。但她设法找到了沙斯塔发现的那条路，就像他一样走到了妻萎芳草的尽头和沙漠的开端，（像他一样）向左望去，瞧见了巨大的黑魁魁的坟场。尽管她是个勇敢的姑娘，现在她的心里终于害怕起来了。说不定其他人马不在那儿！说不定食尸鬼倒在那儿！她冒险伸出下巴颏儿（舌头也伸出了一点儿），笔直地向坟场走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can go back to your mistress now," said Aravis (quite forgetting that he couldn't, until the city gates opened next morning). "Here is money for your pains."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在你可以回到你的女主人那儿去了，”阿拉维斯说道（完全忘了在第二天清晨打开城门之前那侍从是无法回去的），“这儿是给你的酬劳。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“听到命令，就遵命照办。”侍从说道，立刻以相当快的速度向塔什班城跑去。无需告诉他赶紧回去，他也已经对食尸鬼想得很多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This seemed to last for hours. Then there came a time when there was no longer any moon. They seemed to ride in the dead darkness for hours and hours. And after that there came a moment when Shasta noticed that he could see Bree's neck and head in front of him a little more clearly than before; and slowly, very slowly, he began to notice the vast grey flatness on every side. It looked absolutely dead, like something in a dead world; and Shasta felt quite terribly tired and noticed that he was getting cold and that his lips were dry. And all the time the squeak of the leather, the jingle of the bits, and the noise of the hoofs-not Propputtypropputty as it would be on a hard road, but Thubbudythubbudy on the dry sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种情况似乎持续了几个钟头。接下来一段时间，不再见到明月。他们仿佛是在死一般的黑暗中一个钟头又一个钟头地奔驰着。这之后，有一会儿，沙斯塔注意到他能看见前面布里的脖子和脑袋，比先前看得清楚一点儿；于是，慢慢地，十分缓慢地，他开始看到前后左右辽阔而平坦的灰茫茫的大漠。看上去绝对没有生命，像是阴间地府的什么东西似的；而沙斯塔感到疲倦得可怕，注意到自己在发冷，嘴唇是干燥的。自始至终，但听得皮带吱嘎作响，马嚼子丁丁当当，马蹄声不断——不是踩在坚硬道路上的唱唱声，而是踏在干燥沙子上的沙沙声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now," said Bree. "All that about galloping for a day and a night, like in stories, can't really be done. It must be walk and trot: but brisk trots and short walks. And whenever we walk you two humans can slip off and walk too. Now. Are you ready, Hwin? Off we go. Narnia and the North!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听我说，”布里说道，“像故事里那样飞驰一天一夜，事实上是无法办到的。必须是行走和小跑互相配合调剂轻快的小跑，短时间的行走。我们行走时，你们两个也可以下来散散步。喂，你们准备好了吗，赫温？我们走吧。奔向纳尼亚，奔向北方！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first it was delightful. The night had now been going on for so many hours that the sand had almost finished giving back all the sun-heat it had received during the day, and the air was cool, fresh, and clear. Under the moonlight the sand, in every direction and as far as they could see, gleamed as if it were smooth water or a great silver tray. Except for the noise of Bree's and Hwin's hoofs there was not a sound to be heard. Shasta would nearly have fallen asleep if he had not had to dismount and walk every now and then.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开头是愉快的。黑夜已经持续了好几个小时，沙漠已经把它在白天吸收进去的太阳的热量差不多散发掉了，空气是凉快、新鲜和纯净的。四面八方极目可见的沙漠，在月光之下闪闪发亮，仿佛是一泓光滑平静的水，或是一只巨大银盆。除了布里和赫温的蹄声外，一点儿别的声音也听不见。沙斯塔几乎要沉沉入睡了，若不是他不得不时而爬下马来散步的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But not for long. Though Tashbaan looked very far away when they first saw it, it refused to look any further away as they went on. Shasta gave up looking back at it, for it only gave him the feeling that they were not moving at all. Then the light became a nuisance. The glare of the sand made his eyes ache: but he knew he mustn't shut them. He must screw them up and keep on looking ahead at Mount Pire and shouting out directions. Then came the heat. He noticed it for the first time when he had to dismount and walk: as he slipped down to the sand the heat from it struck up into his face as if from the opening of an oven door. Next time it was worse. But the third time, as his bare feet touched the sand he screamed with pain and got one foot back in the stirrup and the other half over Bree's back before you could have said knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而好景不长。他们第一次回头望塔什班城时，虽然看上去已经距离很远了，可他们继续前进时，这城却不见得更远些。沙斯塔不再回头望，因为遥望之际，给了他压根儿滞留原地未动的感觉。于是光芒也变成了讨厌的东西。沙漠炫目的反光使他眼睛发痛，但他知道不能闭上眼睛。他必须使劲儿眯起眼睛，不断地瞅着前边的皮尔峰，大声喊出前进的方向来。随之而来的是炙热。他不得不下马散步时，第一次感觉到了炙热；他从马身上滑到沙地上，沙地上腾起的热气往他的脸上直冲过来，就像从炉灶门口冲出来的。第二次下马时更糟。第三次，他的光脚丫子刚碰到沙子就痛得叫喊起来，说时迟那时快，他一只脚缩回马镫上，另一只脚半己跨到了布里的脊背上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last, after hours of riding, far away on his right there came a single long streak of paler grey, low down on the horizon. Then a streak of red. It was the morning at last, but without a single bird to sing about it. He was glad of the walking bits now, for he was colder than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骑马走了几个钟头以后，终于在他右边的远方出现了一道淡灰色，低低地镶在天边上。随后是一道红色。终于是早晨了，但没有一只鸟来歌唱早晨。现在他倒高兴散散步了，因为他比先前更觉得冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then suddenly the sun rose and everything changed in a moment. The grey sand turned yellow and twinkled as if it was strewn with diamonds. On their left the shadows of Shasta and Hwin and Bree and Aravis, enormously long, raced beside them. The double peak of Mount Pire, far ahead, flashed in the sunlight and Shasta saw they were a little out of the course. "A bit left, a bit left," he sang out. Best of all, when you looked back, Tashbaan was already small and remote. The Tombs were quite invisible: swallowed up in that single, jagged-edged hump which was the city of the Tisroc. Everyone felt better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后太阳突然升起来了，片刻之间一切都变了。灰色的沙漠变成黄色，闪闪烁烁，仿佛里边撒满了钻石。沙斯塔、赫温、布里、阿拉维斯的影子又长又大，在他们的左边竞逐。皮尔峰的双峰在前边儿的远方，在阳光中熠熠生辉。沙斯塔看出他们走得稍微有点儿偏。“靠左边一点儿，靠左边一点儿。”他叫道。最妙的是，当你回头望时，塔什班城已经又小又遥远了。坟场完全看不见了，被吞没在边缘参差不齐的驼峰里了，那驼峰就是蒂斯罗克的城市。大家都觉得比刚才好多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a very short rest they went on again. Same noises, same smells, same glare, till at last their shadows began to fall on their right, and then got longer and longer till they seemed to stretch out to the Eastern end of the world. Very slowly the sun drew nearer to the Western horizon. And now at last he was down and, thank goodness, the merciless glare was gone, though the heat coming up from the sand was still as bad as ever. Four pairs of eyes were looking out eagerly for any sign of the valley that Sallowpad the Raven had spoken about. But, mile after mile, there was nothing but level sand. And now the day was quite definitely done, and most of the stars were out, and still the Horses thundered on and the children rose and sank in their saddles, miserable with thirst and weariness. Not till the moon had risen did Shasta -- in the strange, barking voice of someone whose mouth is perfectly dry-shout out:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休息短短一会儿后又重新赶路了。同样的声音，同样的气味，同样的眩目的反光，终于，影子开始落在他们的右边，愈来愈长，仿佛要伸展到世界的尽头。太阳十分缓慢地挨近西边的地平线，现在太阳终于落山了，感谢老天爷，残酷的反射光芒消失了，尽管从沙漠里升腾起来的热气仍旧咄咄逼人。四对眼睛都在迫切地张望着山谷的踪影，萨罗帕德和渡鸦都提到过山谷的。然而，一英里一英里地走过去了，依旧只见一片平沙。如今白昼肯定是完全结束了，大部分的星星也都出来了，马儿仍旧嘚嘚前行，孩子们在马鞍上起伏不定，又渴又累，苦极了。月亮还没有升上来，沙斯塔用嘴里干到极点的人那种奇怪的粗糙声音喊道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last there was something different -- a mass of rock sticking up out of the sand about fifty yards long and thirty feet high. It did not cast much shadow, for the sun was now very high, but it cast a little. Into that shade they crowded. There they ate some food and drank a little water. It is not easy giving a horse a drink out of a skin bottle, but Bree and Hwin were clever with their lips. No one had anything like enough. No one spoke. The Horses were flecked with foam and their breathing was noisy. The children were pale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后终于出现了个有点儿不同的东西——沙土里隆起一大块石头，高三十英尺，长五十码光景。大石头并不投下多少阴影，因为此刻太阳升得高高的，只形成一点儿遮阴的地方。他们挤到遮阴之处，在那儿吃些食物，喝了一点儿水。盛在皮囊里的水是很难给马喝的，但布里和赫温都巧妙地运用了它们的嘴唇。谁也没有吃够喝够。谁也不说话。马儿浑身都是斑斑点点的汗渍，呼吸的声音很大。孩子们脸色苍白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no mistaking it now. Ahead, and a little to their right, there was at last a slope: a slope downward and hummocks of rock on each side. The Horses were far too tired to speak but they swung round towards it and in a minute or two they were entering the gully. At first it was worse in there than it had been out in the open desert, for there was a breathless stuffiness between the rocky walls and less moonlight. The slope continued steeply downwards and the rocks on either hand rose to the height of cliffs. Then they began to meet vegetation -- prickly cactus-like plants and coarse grass of the kind that would prick your fingers. Soon the horse-hoofs were falling on pebbles and stones instead of sand. Round every bend of the valley -- and it had many bends -- they looked eagerly for water. The Horses were nearly at the end of their strength now, and Hwin, stumbling and panting; was lagging behind Bree. They were almost in despair before at last they came to a little muddiness and a tiny trickle of water through softer and better grass. And the trickle became a brook, and the brook became a stream with bushes on each side, and the stream became a river and there came (after more disappointments than I could possibly describe) -a moment when Shasta, who had been in a kind of doze, suddenly realized that Bree had stopped and found himself slipping off. Before them a little cataract of water poured into a broad pool: and both the Horses were already in the pool with their heads down, drinking, drinking, drinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在可错不了啦。前边儿，稍稍偏右，终于出现了一个斜坡：一个迤逦而下的斜坡，两边都是石块垒成的小丘。马儿累得话也说不出来，只是摇摇晃晃地向前跑去，一两分钟后他们就进了隘谷。一开头，在隘谷里要比在空旷的沙漠上更不舒服，因为夹在石墙之间，闷热得气也透不过来，而且月光也少了。斜坡峻急地往下延伸，两边的岩石高耸成峭壁。接着，他们开始遇见植物了——仙人掌似的多刺植物，以及会扎痛手指的粗糙野草。不久，马蹄不复踏在沙上了，而是踏在卵石上了。他们在山谷的每一个转弯处——拐弯可多哩——迫不及待地寻找着水。马儿几乎到了筋疲力尽的地步，赫温脚步蹒跚、气喘吁吁，落在布里的后面。终于在他们几乎绝望时遇到了一点儿泥浆，和一条从茂盛柔软的青草之间渗过来的涓滴细流。细流变成了小溪，小溪变成了两岸灌木丛生的小河，小河又变成了大河。在经历了我无法形容的许多失望之后，竟出现了喜出望外的时刻：一直处于瞌睡状态的沙斯塔，突然发觉布里停步不走了，他自己也滑下马来了。他们面前有一道小瀑布泻入一个宽阔的水池：两匹马儿已经在水池里了，它们低着脑袋，喝啊，喝啊，喝啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"O-o-oh," said Shasta and plunged in -- it was about up to his knees -- and stooped his head right into the cataract. It was perhaps the loveliest moment in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢——噢——喔。”沙斯塔说，向池塘里跳了进去——池水漫到他的膝头上——他干脆把脑袋伸到小瀑布里去。也许这是他生平最轻松愉快的时刻了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was about ten minutes later when all four of them (the two children wet nearly all over) came out and began to notice their surroundings. The moon was now high enough to peep down into the valley. There was soft grass on both sides of the river, and beyond the grass, trees and bushes sloped up to the bases of the cliffs. There must have been some wonderful flowering shrubs hidden in that shadowy undergrowth for the whole glade was full of the coolest and most delicious smells. And out of the darkest recess among the trees there came a sound Shasta had never heard beforea nightingale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约十分钟以后，他们四个（两个孩子几乎浑身上下都湿透了）才从池塘里出来，看看周围的环境。月亮现在升得高高的，足以照进山谷里来。大河的两边都长着柔嫩的青草，青草外，大树和灌木往上绵延到悬崖绝壁的底部。在那阴暗的灌木丛里必定隐藏着一些奇花香草，因为林中空地里弥漫着最清凉最芳香的气息。从树木间最幽暗的隐秘之地传来了一个声音——沙斯塔以前从未听见过的——夜莺的歌声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Aravis who awoke first. The sun was already high in the heavens and the cool morning hours were already wasted. "It's my fault," she said to herself furiously as she jumped up and began rousing the others. "One wouldn't expect Horses to keep awake after a day's work like that, even if they can talk. And of course that Boy wouldn't; he's had no decent training. But I ought to have known better."</div>

<div class="line_en">"P-please," said Hwin, very shyly, "I feel just like Bree that I can't go on. But when Horses have humans (with spurs and things) on their backs, aren't they often made to go on when they're feeling like this? and then they find they can. I m-mean -- oughtn't we to be able to do even more, now that we're free. It's all for Narnia."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，”赫温十分腼腆地说道，“我的感觉跟布里一样，没法儿赶路了。但有人骑在马背上（还配上了马刺之类的东西），马儿不是在感到饥饿时也往往被驱策着赶路吗？那时，马儿发觉它们能赶路。我的意思是说——现在我们既然自由了，那就应该能赶更多的路。这全是为了纳尼亚啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He didn't say anything about shorter," answered Shasta. "He only said better, because you got to a river this way. If the oasis is due North of Tashbaan, then I'm afraid this may be longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它并没说比较近，”沙斯塔答道，“它只是说比较好，因为在这条路上你碰得到一条河流。如果绿洲是在塔什班城的正北方，那么我想那条路就可能要长些。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think, Ma'am," said Bree very crushingly, "that I know a little more about campaigns and forced marches and what a horse can stand than you do."</div>

<div class="line_en">So they had to wait while Bree had a snack and a drink, and of course Hwin and the children had a snack and a drink too. It must have been nearly eleven o'clock in the morning before they finally got going again. And even then Bree took things much more gently than yesterday. It was really Hwin, though she was the weaker and more tired of the two, who set the pace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，他们不得不等待布里吃东西唱水；当然，赫温和孩子们也跟着吃一点喝一点。他们最后重新赶路时，必定是上午靠近十一点钟光景了。而且即使到了这个时辰，布里干起活来也比昨天更加斯文了。虽然赫温是两匹马儿中比样弱小和更加疲乏的，真正领先的倒是赫温。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The valley itself, with its brown, cool river, and grass and moss and wild flowers and rhododendrons, was such a pleasant place that it made you want to ride slowly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山谷本身以及山谷里棕色的清凉河流，青草、苍苔、野花和杜鹊花，是那么赏心悦目，使你很想放慢驰骋脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To this Hwin made no answer, being, like most highly bred mares, a very nervous and gentle person who was easily put down. In reality she was quite right, and if Bree had had a Tarkaan on his back at that moment to make him go on, he would have found that he was good for several hours' hard going. But one of the worst results of being a slave and being forced to do things is that when there is no one to force you any more you find you have almost lost the power of forcing yourself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫温对此未作答复，像出身高贵的马儿一样，秉性胆怯温和，是容易被吃瘪的。事实上，它的意见是十分正确的，如果此时此刻有个泰坎骑在布里的背上，布里是能拼命跑上好几个钟头的。但做着奴隶而又被迫干活的最坏结果是：没有人强迫你干活时，你发觉自己几乎已经丧失了强迫自己干活的力量。">查看中文翻译</div>
