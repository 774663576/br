<div class="line_en">My mother was there, but she had better things to do than kick a soccer ball around. So she said, anyway. At the time I didn't think there was anything better than kicking a soccer ball around, especially not the likes of laundry or dishes or vacuuming, but my mother didn't agree. And the danger of being home alone with her was that she'd recruit me to help her wash or dust or vacuum, and she wouldn't tolerate the dribbling of a soccer ball around the house as I moved from chore to chore.</div>

<div class="line_en">To play it safe, I waited outside for weeks, just in case the new neighbors moved in early. Literally, it was weeks. I entertained myself by playing soccer with our dog, Champ. Mostly he'd just block because a dog can't exactly kick and score, but once in a while he'd dribble with his nose. The scent of a ball must overwhelm a dog, though, because Champ would eventually try to chomp it, then lose the ball to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bryce wasn't really doing much of anything. He was more hanging back, watching his father move boxes onto the lift-gate.

<div class="line_en">Looking back on the second grade, I like to think it was at least partly scientific curiosity that made me chase after that kiss, but to be honest, it was probably more those blue eyes. All through the second and third grades I couldn't seem to stop myself from following him, from sitting by him, from just wanting to be near him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再看看二年级，我想不仅仅是对吻强烈的好奇心我才一直追着他，但是诚实地说，更多的因素可能是那双蓝眼睛。整个二年级和三年级我都不能阻止自己跟着他，想坐在他边上，想离他近一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then in the fifth grade Shelly Stalls came into the picture. Shelly Stalls is a ninny. A whiny, gossipy, backstabbing ninny who says one thing to one person and the opposite to another. Now that we're in junior high, she's the undisputed diva of drama, but even back in elementary school she knew how to put on a performance. Especially when it came to P. E. I never once saw her run laps or do calisthenics. Instead, she would go into her "delicate" act, claiming her body would absolutely collapse from the strain if she ran or jumped or stretched.</div>

<div class="line_en">It worked. Every year. She'd bring in some note and be sure to swoon a little for the teacher the first few days of the year, after which she'd be excused from anything that required muscles. She never even put up her own chair at the end of the day. The only muscles she exercised regularly were the ones around her mouth, and those she worked out nonstop. If there was an Olympic contest for talking, Shelly Stalls would sweep the event. Well, she'd at least win the gold and silver -- one medal for each side of her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一年她都成功。她会带来什么假条然后在学年开始时在老师面前假装昏倒，她会拒绝任何会损害到肌肉的事。她甚至从来不在放学前把椅子翻起来。她正常锻炼的唯一肌肉就是在她嘴巴周围的那些，它们从来不休息。如果奥林匹克里有讲话比赛的话，雪莉·斯塔尔斯会横扫千军。嗯，她至少能得金牌和银牌——分别分给她嘴巴的两侧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What bugged me about it was not the fact that she got out of P. E.-- who'd want her on their team, anyway? What bugged me about it was that anyone who bothered to look would know that it wasn't asthma or weak ankles or her being "delicate" that was stopping her. It was her hair. She had mountains of it, twisted this way or that, clipped or beaded, braided or swirled. Her ponytails rivaled the ones on carousel horses. And on the days she let it all hang down, she'd sort of shimmy and cuddle inside it like it was a blanket, so that practically all you saw of her face was her nose.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我甚至没有想到仔细看看周围有没有别的学生——两秒钟之内我就把她从他身上拉下来了。布莱斯在他自由的一刻立即跑走了，但是雪莉没有。哦，不，不，不！她立刻冲着我过来，用尽办法又抓又推又拧，告诉我布莱斯是她的，而她绝不会把他让出来。多么难缠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end, Shelly went home early with a bad case of mussed-up hair, while I told my side of things to the principal. Mrs. Shultz is a sturdy lady who probably secretly appreciates the value of a swift kick well placed, and although she told me that it would be better if I let other people work out their own dilemmas, she definitely understood about Shelly Stalls and her hair and told me she was glad I'd had the self-control to do nothing more than restrain her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，雪莉顶着一头乱糟糟的头发提前回家，而我把我的事告诉了校长。夏尔特兹小姐是个很坚定的女士，她大概在暗自感激我快速出击，虽然她告诉我让其他人自己解决问题可能更好些，她绝对了解雪莉·斯塔尔斯和她的头发，然后告诉我她很高兴我控制住了自己没有做比遏制住她更过分的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That's not to say that Bryce held my hand after that, but he did start being a little friendlier to me. Especially in the sixth grade, after Mr. Mertins sat us right next to each other in the third row back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然不是说那之后布莱斯牵了我的手，但是他开始对我更友好了。特别是六年级，在马丁斯先生让我们一起坐在倒数第三排之后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We talked to each other more, too. Especially after Mr. Mertins moved me behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们说的话也更多了。特别是马丁斯先生让我坐在他后面之后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shelly was back the next day with a head full of braids. And of course she got everybody whispering about me, but I just ignored them. The facts spoke for themselves. Bryce didn't go anywhere near her for the rest of the year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪莉第二天顶着满头的辫子回来了。当然她让所有人对我窃窃私语，不过我无视了他们。公道自在人心。剩下的一整年布莱斯都没有再靠近她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sitting next to Bryce was nice. He was nice. He'd say Hi, Juli to me every morning, and once in a while I'd catch him looking my way. He'd always blush and go back to his own work, and I couldn't help but smile. He was so shy. And so cute!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在布莱斯边上很好。他也很好。他每天早上都会对我说“嗨，朱莉”，偶尔我会发现他看着我的方向。他每次都会脸红然后继续做他的作业，我没有办法，就只有微笑。他真的很害羞，很可爱！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pressure of detention made Bryce panic. And even though it bothered my conscience, I'd lean in and whisper answers to him, hoping that maybe I could spend lunch with him instead. His hair smelled like watermelon, and his ear- lobes had fuzz. Soft, blond fuzz. And I wondered about that. How does a boy with such black hair wind up with blond ear fuzz? What's it doing there, anyway? I checked my own ear-lobes in the mirror but couldn't find much of anything on them, and I didn't spot any on other people's either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="留校的压力让布莱斯很是恐慌。而且尽管烦扰到我的良心，我还是会向前倾然后告诉他答案，希望我可以和他一起吃午饭作为代替。他的头发带着西瓜味，而且他的耳垂上有茸毛。柔软的，金色的茸毛。我对此很奇怪。一个有这样黑色头发的男孩怎么会有金色的茸毛呢？到底是怎么回事？我对着镜子查看了我的耳垂，但是上面什么都没有，而且我也没有在别人身上发现过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Mertins had a detention policy about spelling, where if you missed more than seven out of twenty-five words, you had to spend lunch inside with him, writing your words over and over and over again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马丁斯先生有一个关于拼写的留校察看，只要二十五个词里你拼错多于七个，你就得在午饭时间留下来，一次又一次写你的单词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought about asking Mr. Mertins about earlobe fuzz when we were discussing evolution in science, but I didn't. Instead, I spent the year whispering spelling words, sniffing watermelon, and wondering if I was ever going to get my kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想到在我们讨论进化论时问问马丁斯先生关于耳朵茸毛的事，但是我没有。相反的，我用了一年的时间拼写单词，闻西瓜味，幻想我究竟什么时候能得到我的初吻。">查看中文翻译</div>
