<div class="line_en">Many years ago, there was an Emperor, who was so excessively fond of new clothes, that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase, except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor, one is accustomed to say, "he is sitting in council," it was always said of him, "The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe."</div>

<div class="line_en">Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital; strangers arrived every day at the court. One day, two rogues, calling themselves weavers, made their appearance. They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns, the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held, or who was extraordinarily simple in character.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他住的那个大城市里，生活很轻松，很愉快。每天有许多外国人到来。有一天来了两个骗子。他们说他们是织工。他们说，他们能织出谁也想象不到的最美丽的布。这种布的色彩和图案不仅是非常好看，而且用它缝出来的衣服还有一种奇异的作用，那就是凡是不称职的人或者愚蠢的人，都看不见这衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"These must, indeed, be splendid clothes!" thought the Emperor. "Had I such a suit, I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office, and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish! This stuff must be woven for me immediately." And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那正是我最喜欢的衣服！”皇帝心里想。“我穿了这样的衣服，就可以看出我的王国里哪些人不称职；我就可以辨别出哪些人是聪明人，哪些人是傻子。是的，我要叫他们马上织出这样的布来！”他付了许多现款给这两个骗子，叫他们马上开始工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the two pretended weavers set up two looms, and affected to work very busily, though in reality they did nothing at all. They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread; put both into their own knapsacks; and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们摆出两架织机来，装做是在工作的样子，可是他们的织机上什么东西也没有。他们接二连三地请求皇帝发一些最好的生丝和金子给他们。他们把这些东西都装进自己的腰包，却假装在那两架空空的织机上忙碌地工作，一直忙到深夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth," said the Emperor to himself, after some little time had elapsed; he was, however, rather embarrassed, when he remembered that a simpleton, or one unfit for his office, would be unable to see the manufacture. To be sure, he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person; but yet, he would prefer sending somebody else, to bring him intelligence about the weavers, and their work, before he troubled himself in the affair. All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess; and all were anxious to learn how wise, or how ignorant, their neighbors might prove to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很想知道他们织布究竟织得怎样了，”皇帝想。不过，他立刻就想起了愚蠢的人或不称职的人是看不见这布的。他心里的确感到有些不大自在。他相信他自己是用不着害怕的。虽然如此，他还是觉得先派一个人去看看比较妥当。全城的人都听说过这种布料有一种奇异的力量，所以大家都很想趁这机会来测验一下，看看他们的邻人究竟有多笨，有多傻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers," said the Emperor at last, after some deliberation, "he will be best able to see how the cloth looks; for he is a man of sense, and no one can be more suitable for his office than be is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要派诚实的老部长到织工那儿去看看，”皇帝想。“只有他能看出这布料是个什么样子，因为他这个人很有头脑，而且谁也不像他那样称职。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What!" thought he again. "Is it possible that I am a simpleton? I have never thought so myself; and no one must know it now if I am so. Can it be, that I am unfit for my office? No, that must not be said either. I will never confess that I could not see the stuff."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, it is excellent!" replied the old minister, looking at the loom through his spectacles. "This pattern, and the colors, yes, I will tell the Emperor without delay, how very beautiful I think them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，美极了！真是美妙极了！”老大臣说。他戴着眼镜仔细地看。“多么美的花纹！多么美的色彩！是的，我将要呈报皇上说我对于这布感到非常满意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We shall be much obliged to you," said the impostors, and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff. The old minister listened attentively to their words, in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor; and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold, saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun. However, they put all that was given them into their knapsacks; and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我们听到您的话真高兴，”两个织工一起说。他们把这些稀有的色彩和花纹描述了一番，还加上些名词儿。这位老大臣注意地听着，以便回到皇帝那里去时，可以照样背得出来。事实上他也就这样办了。这两个骗子又要了很多的钱，更多的丝和金子，他们说这是为了织布的需要。他们把这些东西全装进腰包里，连一根线也没有放到织机上去。不过他们还是继续在空空的机架上工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on, and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready. It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister; he surveyed the looms on all sides, but could see nothing at all but the empty frames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了不久，皇帝派了另一位诚实的官员去看看，布是不是很快就可以织好。他的运气并不比头一位大臣的好：他看了又看，但是那两架空空的织机上什么也没有，他什么东西也看不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister?" asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador; at the same time making the same gestures as before, and talking of the design and colors which were not there.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I certainly am not stupid!" thought the messenger. "It must be, that I am not fit for my good, profitable office! That is very odd; however, no one shall know anything about it." And accordingly he praised the stuff he could not see, and declared that he was delighted with both colors and patterns. "Indeed, please your Imperial Majesty," said he to his sovereign when he returned, "the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我并不愚蠢！”这位官员想。“这大概是因为我不配担当现在这样好的官职吧？这也真够滑稽，但是我决不能让人看出来！”因此他就把他完全没有看见的布称赞了一番，同时对他们说，他非常喜欢这些美丽的颜色和巧妙的花纹。“是的，那真是太美了，”他回去对皇帝说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now the Emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture, while it was still in the loom. Accompanied by a select number of officers of the court, among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth, he went to the crafty impostors, who, as soon as they were aware of the Emperor's approach, went on working more diligently than ever; although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当这布还在织的时候，皇帝就很想亲自去看一次。他选了一群特别圈定的随员——其中包括已经去看过的那两位诚实的大臣。这样，他就到那两个狡猾的骗子住的地方去。这两个家伙正以全副精神织布，但是一根线的影子也看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is not the work absolutely magnificent?" said the two officers of the crown, already mentioned. "If your Majesty will only be pleased to look at it! What a splendid design!

<div class="line_cn" title="“这是怎么一回事儿呢？”皇帝心里想。“我什么也没有看见！这真是荒唐！难道我是一个愚蠢的人吗？难道我不配做皇帝吗？这真是我从来没有碰见过的一件最可怕的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，它真是美极了！”皇帝说。“我表示十二分地满意！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he smiled most graciously, and looked closely at the empty looms; for on no account would he say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much. All his retinue now strained their eyes, hoping to discover something on the looms, but they could see no more than the others; nevertheless, they all exclaimed, "Oh, how beautiful!" and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material, for the approaching procession. "Magnificent! Charming! Excellent!" resounded on all sides; and everyone was uncommonly gay. The Emperor shared in the general satisfaction; and presented the impostors with the riband of an order of knighthood, to be worn in their button-holes, and the title of "Gentlemen Weavers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他点头表示满意。他装做很仔细地看着织机的样子，因为他不愿意说出他什么也没有看见。跟他来的全体随员也仔细地看了又看，可是他们也没有看出更多的东西。不过，他们也照着皇帝的话说：“啊，真是美极了！”他们建议皇帝用这种新奇的、美丽的布料做成衣服，穿上这衣服亲自去参加快要举行的游行大典。“真美丽！真精致！真是好极了！”每人都随声附和着。每人都有说不出的快乐。皇帝赐给骗子每人一个爵士的头衔和一枚可以挂在纽扣洞上的勋章；并且还封他们为“御聘织师”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place, and had sixteen lights burning, so that everyone might see how anxious they were to finish the Emperor's new suit. They pretended to roll the cloth off the looms; cut the air with their scissors; and sewed with needles without any thread in them. "See!" cried they, at last. "The Emperor's new clothes are ready!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨游行大典就要举行了。在头天晚上，这两个骗子整夜不睡，点起１６支蜡烛。你可以看到他们是在赶夜工，要完成皇帝的新衣。他们装做把布料从织机上取下来。他们用两把大剪刀在空中裁了一阵子，同时又用没有穿线的针缝了一通。最后，他们齐声说：“ 请看！新衣服缝好了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
