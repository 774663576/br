<div class="line_en">Mr Gordon was the teacher at the little village school. He was a kind old man and the children liked him. They enjoyed his lessons and he enjoyed teaching them. There was no piano at the school. This sometimes made him a little unhappy, because he loved music very much. But he sang with the children. He filled their young minds with songs and stories. It was a happy school.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tony turned round. His face was white. "Don't tell the police," he said. "Please. I haven't stolen anything. I haven't done anything wrong."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这里有点不对头，”他自言自语道。他仔细地研究着细细的黑色线条上挂着的一个个黑色小音符。“左手应该这样弹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no, of course not," said the teacher. "But who are you? What are you doing in my classroom? And how did this piano get here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tony is very special," said Mr Gordon. "I have been a teacher for forty years, but I have never met a boy like Tony. He must have music lessons at once. Then he must go to the College of Music in London. He needs to work with other musical boys and girls."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“托尼很特别，”戈登先生说道，“我教了四十年书，还从来没有遇到过像托尼这样的孩子。他一定得立即开始学习音乐课程，然后他应该去伦敦音乐学院上学。他必须和其他学音乐的孩子们一起学习。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can give Tony his first lessons," said Mr Gordon. "I don't want any money -- I'll be very happy to teach this wonderful boy. I feel -- oh, how can I explain to you?… This is a very exciting time for me. Last night I came to school to look for a book, and I found a musician!… But Tony learns very quickly. Soon he will need a really good teacher. Then we'll have to think about money. Perhaps Tony can go to the College of Music in the daytime and work in a restaurant in the evenings…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以先给托尼上启蒙课，”戈登先生说，“我不要钱——能教这个出色的孩子我觉得非常高兴。我觉得——噢，该怎么说呢？…这对我来说是非常令人激动的时刻。昨晚我到学校去找书，结果却发现了一个音乐家！…可是托尼学得很快，要不了多久，他就会需要一个真正出色的老师了。那时我们就必须考虑钱的问题了。或许托尼可以白天上音乐学院的课，晚上在餐馆里打工…”">查看中文翻译</div>
