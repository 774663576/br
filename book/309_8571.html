<div class="line_en">When she came to write her story, she would wonder exactly when the books and the words started to mean not just something, but everything. Was it when she first set eyes on the room with shelves and shelves of them? Or when Max Vandenburg arrived on Himmel Street carrying handfuls of suffering and Hitler's Mein Kampf? Was it reading in the shelters? The last parade to Dachau? Was it The Word Shaker? Perhaps there would never be a precise answer as to when and where it occurred. In any case, that's getting ahead of myself. Before we make it to any of that, we first need to tour Liesel Meminger's beginnings on Himmel Street and the art of saumensching:</div>

<div class="line_en">I should hasten to admit, however, that there was a considerable hiatus between the first stolen book and the second. Another noteworthy point is that the first was stolen from snow and the second from fire. Not to omit that others were also given to her. All told, she owned fourteen books, but she saw her story as being made up predominantly of ten of them. Of those ten, six were stolen, one showed up at the kitchen table, two were made for her by a hidden Jew, and one was delivered by a soft, yellow-dressed afternoon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过我要澄清一下，她隔了很长一段时间，才偷了第二本书。还有一点值得一提，第一本书是从雪地里偷来的，第二本书是从火里偷来的。而且不得不说的是，有几本是别人送她的。她一共有十四本书，不过在她的故事中举足轻重的只有十本。这十本中有六本是偷来的。余下的四本中，有一本出现在餐桌上，有两本是一个躲起来的犹太人为她创作的，最后一本则来自一个阳光和煦而昏黄的午后的馈赠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hair was a close enough brand of German blond, but she had dangerous eyes. Dark brown. You didn't really want brown eyes in Germany around that time. Perhaps she received them from her father, but she had no way of knowing, as she couldn't remember him. There was really only one thing she knew about her father. It was a label she did not understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her hands and the frosty blood on her fingers. Everything about her was undernourished. Wirelike shins. Coat hanger arms. She did not produce it easily, but when it came, she had a starving smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她刚到这里的时候，你还能看到她手上被冰雪噬咬的痕迹，以及手指上冻结成冰的血迹。她的每一寸肌肤都透露出营养不良的意味，比如说瘦如干柴的小腿、衣服架子一样的胳膊。笑对她来说很不容易，就算勉强挤出一个笑容，也总有一种忍饥挨饿的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were boardinghouses crammed with people, rooms filled with questions. And that word. That strange word was always there somewhere, standing in the corner, watching from the dark. It wore suits, uniforms. No matter where they went, there it was, each time her father was mentioned. She could smell it and taste it. She just couldn't spell or understand it. When she asked her mother what it meant, she was told that it wasn't important, that she shouldn't worry about such things. At one boardinghouse, there was a healthier woman who tried to teach the children to write, using charcoal on the wall. Liesel was tempted to ask her the meaning, but it never eventuated. One day, that woman was taken away for questioning. She didn't come back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时候的公寓里总是挤满了人，房间里总有人在问话。那儿就有这个词。这个奇怪的词总是在场，它躲在角落里，在黑暗中窥视。它穿着西装，穿着制服。无论走到哪里，只要有人提及她的父亲，人们就会听到这个词。她问母亲这个词是什么意思，母亲说这个词并不重要，她不必为此担心。在另一间公寓里，有一位看起来挺健康的女人用炭笔在墙上写字，打算教孩子们读书认字。莉泽尔很想问问她，这个词到底是什么意思，但她没能开口。有一天，这个女人被带走问话，从此再也没有回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Liesel arrived in Molching, she had at least some inkling that she was being saved, but that was not a comfort. If her mother loved her, why leave her on someone else's doorstep? Why? Why?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来到莫尔辛的时候，莉泽尔隐隐约约意识到母亲这么做是为了让她活下去，但她没有因此感到宽慰。如果母亲真的爱她，为什么要把她留在别人家里。为什么？为什么？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="为什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fact that she knew the answer -- if only at the most basic level -- seemed beside the point. Her mother was constantly sick and there was never any money to fix her. Liesel knew that. But that didn't mean she had to accept it. No matter how many times she was told that she was loved, there was no recognition that the proof was in the abandonment. Nothing changed the fact that she was a lost, skinny child in another foreign place, with more foreign people. Alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她其实知道答案，但那又怎么样。母亲总是生病，一直都没有钱治病。这些她都知道。可这并不意味着她必须寄人篱下。有多少次，母亲告诉她自己是爱她的，但她怎么也没法认同，因为这份爱的证据明明是抛弃。事情已成定局，她是一个没人要的瘦弱的孩子，与陌生人同住在一个陌生的地方。孤身一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hubermanns lived in one of the small, boxlike houses on Himmel Street. A few rooms, a kitchen, and a shared outhouse with neighbors. The roof was flat and there was a shallow basement for storage. It was supposedly not a basement of adequate depth. In 1939, this wasn't a problem. Later, in '42 and '43, it was. When air raids started, they always needed to rush down the street to a better shelter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="胡伯曼一家住在希默尔街上一栋狭小的砖房里。家里统共只有几个房间、一间厨房和一个与邻居共用的厕所。房子没有阁楼，地下室用来储物。地下室不够深。在一九三九年，这还不成问题，到了一九四二年和一九四三年，问题就来了。空袭来临时，他们总得狂奔过大街，跑向更安全的避难所。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Saumensch, du dreckiges!" Liesel's foster mother shouted that first evening when she refused to have a bath. "You filthy pig! Why won't you get undressed?" She was good at being furious. In fact, you could say that Rosa Hubermann had a face decorated with constant fury. That was how the creases were made in the cardboard texture of her complexion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一天晚上，莉泽尔不肯洗澡，她的养母就骂她：“你这头肮脏的母猪，干吗不肯脱衣服？”她特别擅长发火。实际上，你甚至可以说，罗莎·胡伯曼的脸上常年都挂着怒火。这也是她那张纸板箱一样的脸上会长那么多皱纹的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the beginning, it was the profanity that made an immediate impact. It was so vehement and prolific. Every second word was either Saumensch or Saukerl or Arschloch. For people who aren't familiar with these words, I should explain. Sau, of course, refers to pigs. In the case of Saumensch, it serves to castigate, berate, or plain humiliate a female. Saukerl (pronounced "saukairl") is for a male. Arschloch can be translated directly into "asshole." That word, however, does not differentiate between the sexes. It simply is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，那些骂人的脏话给莉泽尔留下的印象最深。它们是如此猛烈，如此丰富。每句话里必有“Saumensch”、“Saukerl”或“Arschloch”这样的词儿。有些读者想必不了解这些词，那么我来解释一下。前缀“Sau”当然是指猪，“Sau”加上后缀“mensch”则用来责骂、斥责或是单纯地羞辱女人。后缀“kerl”（这个词读作“凯尔”）指代男人。“Arschloch”可以直接翻译成混账。这个词不分男女。混账是指所有混账的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liesel, naturally, was bathed in anxiety. There was no way she was getting into any bath, or into bed for that matter. She was twisted into one corner of the closetlike washroom, clutching for the nonexistent arms of the wall for some level of support. There was nothing but dry paint, difficult breath, and the deluge of abuse from Rosa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚住进新家的莉泽尔，浑身上下都焦虑得不行。这种状态下，她当然既不肯洗澡，也不愿上床睡觉。她蜷缩在盥洗室逼仄的一角，多希望墙壁能长出一副臂膀让她抓住，可是墙壁上没有臂膀，只有干透的油漆。罗莎如洪水般袭来的辱骂令她喘不上气。">查看中文翻译</div>
