<div class="line_en">Within, the seven walls were cracked and crooked. God is one, Septon Osmynd had taught her when she was a girl, with seven aspects, as the sept is a single building, with seven walls. The wealthy septs of the cities had statues of the Seven and an altar to each. In Winterfell, Septon Chayle hung carved masks from each wall. Here Catelyn found only rough charcoal drawings. Ser Wendel set the torch in a sconce near the door, and left to wait outside with Robar Royce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣堂之内，七面高墙皆已破碎倾塌。我们的上帝独一无二，但他有七种位态，正如我们的圣堂是一座建筑，却有着七面高墙，她还是个小女孩时，奥密德修士便如此教诲她。大城市里那些繁华的圣堂中七神总有各自的雕像，而每一位都有专门的祭坛。在临冬城，柴尔修士只在每面墙上悬挂不同的雕刻面具。在此地，凯特琳只看得到粗糙的素描画。文德尔爵士把火把插进门边的壁台，退回门外去陪伴罗拔·罗伊斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was full dark before they found the village. Catelyn found herself wondering if the place had a name. If so, its people had taken that knowledge with them when they fled, along with all they owned, down to the candles in the sept. Ser Wendel lit a torch and led her through the low door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走到村庄之前，天便已全黑。凯特琳默默地思量，不知这村子是否有名字。就算曾经有过，也早已被逃难的人群所带走。他们带走了每一件东西，甚至没放过圣堂的蜡烛。文德尔爵士点起一根火把，领她穿过低矮的门楣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catelyn studied the faces. The Father was bearded, as ever. The Mother smiled, loving and protective. The Warrior had his sword sketched in beneath his face, the Smith his hammer. The Maid was beautiful, the Crone wizened and wise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯特琳仔细端详那些面孔。和别处一样，天父留着胡须。圣母笑意不减，慈祥和蔼。战士擎着巨剑。铁匠拿着锤子。少女青春又美丽。老妪枯瘦而睿智。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the seventh face… the Stranger was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable. Here the face was a black oval, a shadow with stars for eyes. It made Catelyn uneasy. She would get scant comfort there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而那第七张脸…陌客的脸孔分辨不出男女，更像两者同体。他是从遥远之地来的流浪人，天边永恒的放逐者，既像人又不像人，不被了解更无从了解。在此地，他的脸被画成一个黑色的椭圆，黑影之中加上两点星光权作眼睛。这张面庞让凯特琳不安。从陌客那里她无法寻求安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A crack ran down through the Mother's left eye. It made her look as if she were crying. Catelyn could hear Ser Wendel's booming voice, and now and again Ser Robar's quiet answers, as they talked of the coming battle. Otherwise the night was still. Not even a cricket could be heard, and the gods kept their silence. Did your old gods ever answer you, Ned? she wondered. When you knelt before your heart tree, did they hear you?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣母的左眼上横贯着一道裂痕，看来好似哭泣。凯特琳听见文德尔爵士的大嗓门，时不时还有罗拔爵士低声的回答，他们应在谈论即将来临的战斗。舍此之外，夜晚一片沉寂，连蟋蟀的声音都听不到。诸神保持沉默。奈德呀，你的远古诸神回应过你吗？她不禁想，当你跪在心树之下，它们真的在倾听你的话语吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She knelt before the Mother. "My lady, look down on this battle with a mother's eyes. They are all sons, every one. Spare them if you can, and spare my own sons as well. Watch over Robb and Bran and Rickon. Would that I were with them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她在圣母面前跪下。“夫人啊，请用您慈母的眼光来看护这场战争。他们都是您的子孙，每个人都是。求您眷顾他们，眷顾我的儿子。求您看护罗柏、布兰和瑞肯，一如我在他们身旁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flickering torchlight danced across the walls, making the faces seem half-alive, twisting them, changing them. The statues in the great septs of the cities wore the faces the stonemasons had given them, but these charcoal scratchings were so crude they might be anyone. The Father's face made her think of her own father, dying in his bed at Riverrun. The Warrior was Renly and Stannis, Robb and Robert, Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow. She even glimpsed Arya in those lines, just for an instant. Then a gust of wind through the door made the torch sputter, and the semblance was gone, washed away in orange glare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火炬发出的摇曳光芒在墙壁上舞蹈，那些脸庞似乎被赋予了生命，火光扭曲着它们，改变着它们。城市里大圣堂中的塑像总能留下石匠雕工的心机，然而此处的木炭图画却粗拙得无有特点。天父的脸让她想起了自己的父亲，此刻正在奔流城卧床不起，奄奄一息。战士让她想起了蓝礼和史坦尼斯，罗柏和劳勃，詹姆·兰尼斯特和琼恩·雪诺。恍惚之间，在那些线条中她甚至看见了艾利亚的神色。一阵风穿过门槛，火炬劈啪摇荡，这种意象便随之而去，湮没在橘红色的光辉中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her head swam, and the sept seemed to move around her. The shadows swayed and shifted, furtive animals racing across the cracked white walls. Catelyn had not eaten today. Perhaps that had been unwise. She told herself that there had been no time, but the truth was that food had lost its savor in a world without Ned. When they took his head off, they killed me too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的头脑开始发晕，整个圣堂在身旁旋转。四周暗影摇晃轮换，诡异的禽兽在破碎的白墙上奔波。凯特琳整天没有进食。这并不明智。她对自己无力地分辩说都是因为没有时间，然而她又深知，在失去了奈德的世界里一切都没了滋味。他们砍下他的头颅，一次杀了两人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The smoke was making her eyes burn. She rubbed at them with the heels of her scarred hands. When she looked up at the Mother again, it was her own mother she saw. Lady Minisa Tully had died in childbed, trying to give Lord Hoster a second son. The baby had perished with her, and afterward some of the life had gone out of Father. She was always so calm, Catelyn thought, remembering her mother's soft hands, her warm smile. If she had lived, how different our lives might have been. She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her eldest daughter, kneeling here before her. I have come so many thousands of leagues, and for what? Who have I served? I have lost my daughters, Robb does not want me, and Bran and Rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother. I was not even with Ned when he died…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火炬散发的烟尘熏得她眼睛隐隐作痛。她用伤残的手掌努力擦拭。当她再度抬眼凝视圣母时，却看见了自己的母亲。米妮莎·徒利夫人因难产过世，当时是为给霍斯特公爵产下次子。孩子和她一同离去，父亲的一部分也随她走了。她总那么沉静，凯特琳想着，想着母亲柔和的手臂，温暖的笑意。如果她还在世上，我们的生活将变得多么不同啊。她不知米妮莎夫人是否了解她的长女，这个跪在她面前的女人的心境。呵，我跋涉了千山万水，为了什么？我到底是为了谁？我失去了自己的女儿们，罗柏不要我，布兰和瑞肯想必认为我是个冷酷无情的母亲。甚至奈德临终时，我到底在哪儿…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had seen enough of Robert Baratheon at Winterfell to know that the king did not regard Joffrey with any great warmth. If the boy was truly Jaime's seed, Robert would have put him to death along with his mother, and few would have condemned him. Bastards were common enough, but incest was a monstrous sin to both old gods and new, and the children of such wickedness were named abominations in sept and godswood alike. The dragon kings had wed brother to sister, but they were the blood of old Valyria where such practices had been common, and like their dragons the Targaryens answered to neither gods nor men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在临冬城和劳勃·拜拉席恩相处的短短时日，她已知国王没有给过乔佛里多少温暖。假如知道那男孩是詹姆的种，想必劳勃会毫不犹豫将他和他母亲一并处死，而对此任何人都无法责难。私生子固然司空见惯，然而乱伦之举却为新旧诸神所不容，由此邪行而生的孩子将在圣堂里或神木林中被公开宣布为孽种。龙王们兄妹通婚，然而他们是古老瓦雷利亚的血统，遵循瓦雷利亚人的习俗。像他们的龙一样，高傲的坦格利安家族从不听从神人的呼唤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Does Cersei pray to you too, my lady?" Catelyn asked the Mother. She could see the proud, cold, lovely features of the Lannister queen etched upon the wall. The crack was still there; even Cersei could weep for her children. "Each of the Seven embodies all of the Seven," Septon Osmynd had told her once. There was as much beauty in the Crone as in the Maiden, and the Mother could be fiercer than the Warrior when her children were in danger. Yes…</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind her the torch spit, and suddenly it seemed to her that it was her sister's face on the wall, though the eyes were harder than she recalled, not Lysa's eyes but Cersei's.

<div class="line_en">Ned must have known, and Lord Arryn before him. Small wonder that the queen had killed them both. Would I do any less for my own? Catelyn clenched her hands, feeling the tightness in her scarred fingers where the assassin's steel had cut to the bone as she fought to save her son. "Bran knows too," she whispered, lowering her head. Gods be good, he must have seen something, heard something, that was why they tried to kill him in his bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奈德一定已了解这事实，如同在他之前的艾林公爵。难怪王后把他们都杀了。换作是我，会这么做吗？凯特琳握紧拳头，伤残的手指上有从刺客的刀下拯救儿子而留下的伤痕，深可见骨，至今未愈。“布兰也知道，”她轻声说，低下了头。诸神在上，他一定看见或听到了什么，所以他们要把他扼杀于病床。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. She knelt before the Smith, who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give her sweet Bran his protection. She went to the Maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard them in their innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield him in his battles. Lastly she turned to the Crone, whose statues often showed her with a lamp in one hand. "Guide me, wise lady," she prayed. "Show me the path I must walk, and do not let me stumble in the dark places that lie ahead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在失落和疲惫中，凯特琳·史塔克投身于神灵的怀抱。她跪在铁匠面前，因为他负责修复破损的事物，她请求他给予她可爱的甜心布兰以关注和保护；她跪在少女面前，恳求她将她的勇气赐予艾莉亚和珊莎，保护她们的清白之身；在天父面前，她祈求公正，祈求追寻正义的力量和知晓正义的智慧；在战士面前，她祈求他让罗柏变得强壮，护佑他平安地穿越战场。最后，她来到老妪跟前，老妪的形象总是一手擎灯。“指引我吧，睿智的夫人，”她祷告，“指引我该走的路，别让我在前方的黑暗中迷失方向。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They rode in silence through sparse woodland where the trees leaned drunkenly away from the sea. The nervous whinny of horses and the clank of steel guided them back to Renly's camp. The long ranks of man and horse were armored in darkness, as black as if the Smith had hammered night itself into steel. There were banners to her right, banners to her left, and rank on rank of banners before her, but in the predawn gloom, neither colors nor sigils could be discerned. A grey army, Catelyn thought. Grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners. As they sat their horses waiting, Renly's shadow knights pointed their lances upward, so she rode through a forest of tall naked trees, bereft of leaves and life. Where Storm's End stood was only a deeper darkness, a wall of black through which no stars could shine, but she could see torches moving across the fields where Lord Stannis had made his camp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沉默地策马穿越稀疏的树林，高大的树木因海风的吹刮而东倒西歪地侧向海的反面。马群紧张的嘶鸣和铁器叮当的交击是他们天然的向导，指引他们回到蓝礼的营地。在黑暗之中，人和马排列成长长的纵队。他们漆黑无垠，好似“铁匠”将黑夜本身锻造进了钢铁中。她的左边有飘扬的旗帜，右边也是，前方的旗帜更是一排接着一排，然而在黎明前的黑暗之中，看不到一种颜色，分不出一个纹章。这是一支灰色的军队，凯特琳想，灰色的战士骑着灰色的骏马打着灰色的旗号。蓝礼的阴影骑士们高举长枪，静坐在马鞍上等待。她穿过这片由裸露而高大的林木组成的森林，将这些被剥夺了绿叶和生机的大树抛在身后。抬眼望去，风息堡矗立之处是一片更深沉的黑暗，黑色的墙壁无法反射夜晚的星光，隔着原野，只见史坦尼斯公爵扎营之地正有火把来来往往。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The candles within Renly's pavilion made the shimmering silken walls seem to glow, transforming the great tent into a magical castle alive with emerald light. Two of the Rainbow Guard stood sentry at the door to the royal pavilion. The green light shone strangely against the purple plums of Ser Parmen's surcoat, and gave a sickly hue to the sunflowers that covered every inch of Ser Emmon's enameled yellow plate. Long silken plumes flew from their helms, and rainbow cloaks draped their shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">"In a moment, Lady Catelyn," Renly replied. Brienne fit backplate to breastplate over his quilted tunic.

<div class="line_en">Brienne moved faster than Catelyn would have believed. Her own sword was not to hand, so she snatched Renly's from its scabbard and raised it to catch Emmon's axe on the downswing. A spark flashed bluewhite as steel met steel with a rending crash, and Brienne sprang to her feet, the body of the dead king thrust rudely aside. Ser Emmon stumbled over it as he tried to close, and Brienne's blade sheared through the wooden haft to send his axehead spinning. Another man thrust a flaming torch at her back, but the rainbow cloak was too sodden with blood to burn. Brienne spun and cut, and torch and hand went flying. Flames crept across the carpet. The maimed man began to scream. Ser Emmon dropped the axe and fumbled for his sword. The second man-at-arms lunged, Brienne parried, and their swords danced and clanged against each other. When Emmon Cuy came wading back in, Brienne was forced to retreat, yet somehow she held them both at bay. On the ground, Renly's head rolled sickeningly to one side, and a second mouth yawned wide, the blood coming from him now in slow pulses.</div>

"Brienne, with me," Catelyn commanded. The girl was not slow to see the chance. A slash, and the green silk parted. They stepped out into darkness and the chill of dawn.
