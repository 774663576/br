<div class="line_en">Eugene began the year earnestly as room-mate of a young man who had been the best student in the Altamont High School. His name was Bob Sterling. Bob Sterling was nineteen years old, the son of a widow. He was of middling height, always very neatly and soberly dressed; there was nothing conspicuous about him. For this reason, he could laugh good-naturedly, a little smugly, at whatever was conspicuous. He had a good mind -- bright, attentive, studious, unmarked by originality or inventiveness. He had a time for everything: he apportioned a certain time for the preparation of each lesson, and went over it three times, mumbling rapidly to himself. He sent his laundry out every Monday. When in merry company he laughed heartily and enjoyed himself, but he always kept track of the time. Presently, he would look at his watch, saying: "Well, this is all very nice, but it's getting no work done," and he would go.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he returned to the university for his second year, he found the place adjusted soberly to war. It seemed quieter, sadder -- the number of students was smaller and they were younger. The older ones had gone to war. The others were in a state of wild, but subdued, restlessness. They were careless of colleges, careers, successes -- the war had thrilled them with its triumphing Now. Of what use To-morrow! Of what use all labor for To-morrow! The big guns had blown all spun schemes to fragments: they hailed the end of all planned work with a fierce, a secret joy. The business of education went on half-heartedly, with an abstracted look: in the classroom, their eyes were vague upon the book, but their ears cocked attentively for alarums and excursions without.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他返回大学读二年级的时候，尤金发现学校里气氛很严肃，这跟当时的战争有关。与以前相比，现在的校园更加安静、更加阴沉了——因为学生数量少了许多，他们的年龄都不大。年龄稍大一些的全都打仗去了。剩下的学生虽然仍有人管束，但是大都处于狂热的状态，一个个心绪不宁。他们对读书、对毕业以后的就业和成功都心存各种顾忌——唯有前线的胜利让他们感到激动和鼓舞。用不着操心明天！为明天而用功读书又有什么用！大炮已经把所有的计划轰成了碎片，所有按部就班的工作已经结束，对此他们内心感到狂热，并且欣喜地欢呼。学校的教学工作仍然漫不经心地进行着，学生们个个心不在焉：人虽然在教室里，眼睛虽然盯着书本，但是耳朵却竖得老高，正凝神聆听外边传来的战报。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he roomed the remainder of the term in one of the dormitories. He had two room-mates -- one, an Altamont young man who answered to the name of L. K. Duncan (the "L" stood for Lawrence, but every one called him "Elk") and the other, the son of an Episcopal minister, Harold Gay. Both were several years older than Eugene: Elk Duncan was twenty-four, and Harold Gay, twenty-two. But it is doubtful whether a more precious congress of freaks had ever before gathered in two small rooms, one of which they used as a "study."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那个学期剩下的日子里，他却搬进了学校的一间集体宿舍。他有两位室友——一位也是阿尔特蒙人，名叫L.K。邓肯（“L”代表劳伦斯，但大家都叫他“老鹿”），另一位是圣公会一位牧师之子，名叫哈罗德·盖伊。两人都比尤金年长几岁：“老鹿”24岁，哈罗德·盖伊22岁。这3个性情古怪的人能够聚在一起，真是很不容易。他们把两间屋子的其中一间当作“书房”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elk Duncan was the son of an Altamont attorney, a small Democratic politician, mighty in county affairs. Elk Duncan was tall -- an inch or two over six feet -- and incredibly thin, or rather narrow. He was already a little bald, he had a high prominent forehead, and large pale bulging eyes: from that point his long pale face sloped backward to his chin. His shoulders were a trifle bowed and very narrow; the rest of his body had the symmetry of a lead pencil. He always dressed very foppishly, in tight suits of blue flannel, with high stiff collars, fat silken cravats, and colored silk handkerchiefs. He was a student in the Law School, but he spent a large part of his time, industriously, in avoiding study.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老鹿是阿尔特蒙一位律师的儿子，他的父亲是民主党的一名小政客，在当地影响很大。老鹿的身材很高——大概有六英尺一二，但却非常瘦，或者说非常单薄。他的脑袋已经有些秃顶了，前额高高的，大而浅色的眼睛向外鼓出着。苍白的长脸从眼部开始就往里斜下去，一直斜到下巴的位置。他的肩膀有些弯曲，而且非常窄；他身体的其余部分像铅笔一样匀称。他经常打扮得像个花花公子，穿着紧身的法兰绒西装、高高的硬领、宽大的丝绸领结，胸前的口袋里还塞着花花绿绿的丝质手帕。他是法学院的学生，但是却把大量的时间花在勤奋钻研逃避读书上去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

His posture toward life was very much that of the barker of a carnival sideshow: loquacious, patronizing, and cynical.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年纪较小的学生——尤其是一年级的新生——吃完饭后常常围在老鹿的身边，目瞪口呆地听他吹牛聊天。他吹得越神奇，他们就越是渴望听下去。他的生活态度就像游乐场里那些专门吆喝拉拢观众的人：夸夸其谈、神气十足、玩世不恭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other room-mate, Harold Gay, was a good soul, no older than a child. He wore spectacles, which gave the only glister to the dull grayness of his face; he was plain and ugly without any distinction: he had been puzzled so long by at least four-fifths of the phenomena of existence that he no longer made any effort to comprehend them. Instead, he concealed his shyness and bewilderment under a braying laugh that echoed at all the wrong places, and a silly grin full of an absurd and devilish knowingness. His association with Elk Duncan was one of the proud summits of his life: he weltered in the purple calcium which bathed that worthy, he smoked cigarettes with a debauched leer, and cursed loudly and uneasily with the accent of a depraved clergyman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一位室友的名字叫哈罗德·盖伊，他是个心地善良的大孩子。他戴着一副眼镜，这是他灰暗的脸上唯一富有光彩的东西。他的长相既平庸又丑陋，没有一点特别之处。周围的事物至少有4/5令他迷感不解，因而他也不需再费心思了解它们了。相反，为了掩饰他的胆怯和困惑，他动辄就会像驴一样哈哈地笑起来，但是往往都笑错了时机。他笑的时候呲牙咧嘴、得意极了。能跟老鹿结成一帮，是他一生中最值得骄傲的事了。他整天跟在这位花花公子的身后到处乱转，嘴里还叼着烟，一双放荡不羁的眼睛四下乱瞅。他一边大声咒骂，一边又深感不安，活像一个堕落的牧师。">查看中文翻译</div>

If you go on like this, you'll begin to chew gum, and fritter away your Sunday-school money at the movies. Think of the rest of us, please. 'Gene here's only a young boy, as pure as a barnyard privy, and, as for me, I've always moved in the best circles, and associated with only the highest class of bartenders and ladylike streetwalkers.

<div class="line_en">She had frequent periods of sickness. She went constantly to the doctors for treatment and advice. Sometimes she went to the hospital for several days. Her illness manifested itself in various ways -- sometimes in a terrible mastoid pain, sometimes in nervous exhaustion, sometimes in an hysterical collapse in which she laughed and wept by turns, and which was governed partly by Gant's illness and a morbid despair over her failure to bear a child. She drank stealthily at all times -- she drank in nibbling draughts for stimulants, never enough for drunkenness. She drank vile liquids -- seeking only the effect of alcohol and getting at it in strange ways through a dozen abominations called "tonics" and "extracts." Almost deliberately she ruined her taste for the better sort of potable liquors, concealing from herself, under the convenient labellings of physic, the ugly crawling hunger in her blood.

<div class="line_en">But, unless actually bedridden, she was never absent from her father for many hours. The shadow of his death lay over their lives. They shuddered below its horror; its protracted menace, its unsearchable enigma, deprived them of dignity and courage. They were dominated by the weary and degrading egotism of life, which is blandly philosophical over the death of the alien, but sees in its own the corruption of natural law. It was as hard for them to think of Gant's death as of God's death: it was a great deal harder, because he was more real to them than God, he was more immortal than God, he was God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，除非她真的病倒在床上爬不起来，否则她从来不会长时间离开她的父亲。甘特即将死去的阴影笼罩在他们的生命里。在死亡的恐怖之下，在死亡挥之不去的威胁之中，在那无法探究的神秘里，他们全都战栗不已。他们的尊严和勇气都被剥夺一空。他们不顾一切、神情疲惫、不顾自尊地想保全自己的生命。每当死神降临在陌生人身上的时候，人们都能够平静、达观地接受；可一旦轮到自己的时候，人人都会觉得死亡是一件违背自然规律的事。他们不敢想象甘特会死，就像不敢想象上帝会死一样；事实上他们更难想象前者，因为在他们眼里，甘特比上帝更加真实，比上帝更加不朽，他就是上帝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This hideous twilight into which their lives had passed froze Eugene with its terror, and choked him with fury. He would grow enraged after reading a letter from home and pound the grained plaster of the dormitory wall until his knuckles were bloody. They have taken his courage away! he thought. They have made a whining coward out of him! No, and if I die, no damned family about. Blowing their messy breaths in your face! Snuffling down their messy noses at you! Gathering around you till you can't breathe. Telling you how well you're looking with hearty smiles, and boo-hooing behind your back. O messy, messy, messy death! Shall we never be alone?

<div class="line_en">The campus had its candidates, its managers, its bosses, its machines, as had the State. A youngster developed in college the political craft he was later to exert in Party affairs. The son of a politician was schooled by his crafty sire before the down was off his cheeks: at sixteen, his life had been plotted ahead to the governorship, or to the proud dignities of a Congressman. The boy came deliberately to the university to bait and set his first traps: deliberately he made those friendships that were most likely to benefit him later. By his junior year, if he was successful, he had a political manager, who engineered his campus ambitions; he moved with circumspection, and spoke with a trace of pomp nicely weighed with cordiality:</div>

Obviously, he would never be governor. Obviously, he would never be a politician, because he said funny things. He was not the man to lead a class or say a prayer; he was a man for curious enterprise. Well, thought they benevolently, we need some such. We are not all made for weighty business.</div>

His escape from the bleak horror of disease and hysteria and death impending, that hung above his crouched family, left him with a sense of aerial buoyance, drunken freedom. He had come to the place alone, without companions. He had no connections. He had, even now, not one close friend. And this isolation was in his favor. Every one knew him at sight: every one called him by name, and spoke to him kindly. He was not disliked. He was happy, full of expansive joy, he greeted every one with enthusiastic gusto. He had a vast tenderness, an affection for the whole marvellous and unvisited earth, that blinded his eyes. He was closer to a feeling of brotherhood than he had ever been, and more alone. He was filled with a divine indifference for all appearance. Joy ran like a great wine through his young expanding limbs; he bounded down the paths with wild cries in his throat, leaping for life like an apple, trying to focus the blind desire that swept him apart, to melt down to a bullet all of his formless passion, and so, slay death, slay love.</div>

It began to sprinkle, then it rained. He was initiated into literary fraternities, dramatic fraternities, theatrical fraternities, speaking fraternities, journalistic fraternities, and in the Spring into a social fraternity.

<div class="line_en">His father spent most of the day staring vacantly into the parlor fire. Miss Florry Mangle, the nurse, gave him the morbid comfort of her silence: she rocked incessantly before the fire, thirty heel-taps to the minute, with arms tight-folded on her limp breasts. Occasionally she talked of death and disease. Gant had aged and wasted shockingly. His heavy clothes wound round his feeble shanks: his face was waxen and transparent -- it was like a great beak. He looked clean and fragile. The cancer, Eugene thought, flowered in him like some terrible but beautiful plant. His mind was very clear, not doting, but sad and old. He spoke little, with almost comical gentleness, but he ceased to listen almost as soon as one answered.</div>

For three months he had wandered alone through the South, selling to the merchants in small towns space for advertisements upon laundry cards.

<div class="line_en">The terrible draught smote him with the speed and power of a man's fist. He was made instantly drunken, and he knew instantly why men drank. It was, he knew, one of the great moments in his life -- he lay, greedily watching the mastery of the grape over his virgin flesh, like a girl for the first time in the embrace of her lover. And suddenly, he knew how completely he was his father's son -- how completely, and with what added power and exquisite refinement of sensation, was he Gantian. He exulted in the great length of his limbs and his body, through which the mighty liquor could better work its wizardry. In all the earth there was no other like him, no other fitted to be so sublimely and magnificently drunken. It was greater than all the music he had ever heard; it was as great as the highest poetry.

Already the earth was full of Christmas. He remembered that he had bought no gifts. He had a few dollars in his pocket; before the shops closed he must get presents for the family. Bareheaded he set off for the town. He knew that he was drunk and that he staggered; but he believed that with care and control he could hide his state from any one who saw him.

When he got into the town the streets were thronged with late shoppers. An air of completion was on everything. The people were streaming home to Christmas.

<div class="line_en">The boy was doing a multiple penance -- he had committed his first great wrong in being at once so remote from them and so near to them. His present trouble was aggravated by the cross-complication of Eliza's thrusts at his father, and the latent but constantly awakening antagonism of mother and daughter. In addition, he bore directly Eliza's nagging and carping attack. All this he was prepared for -- it was the weather of his mother's nature (she was as fond of him as of any of them, he thought), and the hostility of Helen and Luke was something implacable, unconscious, fundamental, that grew out of the structure of their lives. He was of them, he was recognizably marked, but he was not with them, nor like them. He had been baffled for years by the passionate enigma of their dislike -- their tenders of warmth and affection, when they came, were strange to him: he accepted them gratefully and with a surprise he did not wholly conceal. Otherwise, he had grown into a shell of sullenness and quiet: he spoke little in the house.</div>

He felt that he was being unfairly dealt with, but as the hammering went on he drew his head bullishly down and held his tongue, counting the hours until his holiday should end.

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，上帝当然是公正的，一定是公正的！”尤金大声地嚷嚷着，“因为我已经得到了报应。天啊，我要花这一生把我失落的心重新找回来，要想办法医治并忘掉你留在我童年里的每一处疮疤。我离开摇篮后的第一个举动，就是要爬到门口。从那时起，我的每一个举动都在设法逃离你们。现在，我终于摆脱你们而获得自由了，虽然你们可能还要再控制我几年。就算我不自由，那也只是关在自己的牢狱里，我要为自己寻找美好的事物，我一定要在我生命的荒野里找到某种秩序：我发誓一定要找到逃离这个牢笼的途径，尽管这可能要花20多年的时间——独自一个人去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
