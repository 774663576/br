<div class="line_en">I ran my fingers across the page, feeling the dents where he had pressed the pen to the paper so hard that it had nearly broken through. I could picture him writing this -- scrawling the angry letters in his rough handwriting, slashing through line after line when the words came out wrong, maybe even snapping the pen in his too-big hand; that would explain the ink splatters. I could imagine the frustration pulling his black eyebrows together and crumpling his forehead. If I'd been there, I might have laughed. Don't give yourself a brain hemorrhage, Jacob, I would have told him. Just spit it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我用手指一行一行地划过纸上的文字，碰到那些凹痕，他用笔写字时用力过猛几乎把纸都戳破了。我能想象出他写这些话时的样子——他笔迹潦草，横七竖八地画出这些字母，用以宣泄他心中的愤怒，然后一行又一行地划掉那些措辞有误的话语，也许他甚至还会用那只过大的手生气地拧断钢笔。我想象得出沮丧挫败的感觉使他漆黑的眉毛紧皱在一起的样子。要是我在那里的话，我可能会大笑起来。别让你自己脑出血，雅各布。我会这样告诉他，吐出来就可以了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ha. Good one." He shrugged out of the jacket as if my glance had reminded him he still had it on, and hung it on the peg reserved for his gear. His gun belt was already slung in place -- he hadn't felt the need to wear that to the station for a few weeks.

<div class="line_en">Afternoons were the hardest part of my day. Ever since my former best friend (and werewolf), Jacob Black, had informed on me about the motorcycle I'd been riding on the sly -- a betrayal he had devised in order to get me grounded so that I couldn't spend time with my boyfriend (and vampire), Edward Cullen -- Edward had been allowed to see me only from seven till nine-thirty p. m., always inside the confines of my home and under the supervision of my dad's unfailingly crabby glare.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was an escalation from the previous, slightly less stringent grounding that I'd earned for an unexplained three-day disappearance and one episode of cliff diving.</div>

<div class="line_en">I reached for his hand, and sighed when his cold fingers found mine. His touch brought with it the strangest sense of relief -- as if I'd been in pain and that pain had suddenly ceased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拉起他的手，当他冰冷的手指碰到我的手指时，我叹了叹气。他的触碰给我带来一阵最陌生的解脱感——好像我痛苦万分时感受到的那种痛苦突然停止了一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No. I didn't believe that. I felt guilty for even thinking it, and was glad -- as I was often glad -- that I was the one person whose thoughts were a mystery to Edward.</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled my wrist up to his face, our hands still twisted together. His eyes closed as his nose skimmed along the skin there, and he smiled gently without opening them. Enjoying the bouquet while resisting the wine, as he'd once put it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把我的手腕举到脸庞，我们的手还是挽在一起。他的鼻子轻轻地滑过我的皮肤时闭起了眼睛，然后没有睁开眼就温柔地微笑起来。抵抗美酒的诱惑，品尝美酒的芳香，他曾经如是说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew that the scent of my blood -- so much sweeter to him than any other person's blood, truly like wine beside water to an alcoholic -- caused him actual pain from the burning thirst it engendered. But he didn't seem to shy away from it as much as he once had. I could only dimly imagine the Herculean effort behind this simple gesture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道我的血液的味道——与其他人的血相比对他而言更加甜美，的确就像嗜酒如命的人面前的美酒和水一样——由此而产生灼烧的干渴实际上会令他痛苦不堪，但是他好像不再像以前那样逃避它了。我只能模模糊糊地想象出在这个简单的动作背后，他所做出的努力就像赫尔克里斯那样巨大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A sharp jolt of unease pierced my stomach as I realized how short the time really was. Of course this change was necessary -- and the key to what I wanted more than everything else in the world put together -- but I was deeply conscious of Charlie sitting in the other room enjoying his game, just like every other night. And my mother, Renee, far away in sunny Florida, still pleading with me to spend the summer on the beach with her and her new husband. And Jacob, who, unlike my parents, would know exactly what was going on when I disappeared to some distant school. Even if my parents didn't grow suspicious for a long time, even if I could put off visits with excuses about travel expenses or study loads or illnesses, Jacob would know the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我意识到余下的时间是如此短暂之时，一记刺骨的重击穿透我的胃，令我痛彻心扉。当然这种改变是必要的——把世界上所有其他的东西都放在一起也比不过我最想要的东西，而这就是通向它的钥匙——但是我深深地意识到查理还坐在另一个房间看球赛，就像其他夜晚一样，而我的母亲蕾妮在遥远的阳光灿烂的佛罗里达，仍然在请求我与她和她的新婚丈夫一起共度夏天呢。还有雅各布，他不像我的父母那样，要是我消失到某个遥远的学校，他会千真万确地知道到底发生了什么事儿。即使我父母在很长一段时间不起疑心，即使我找到借口推辞去看望他们，如昂贵的旅费或功课紧或生病了，雅各布还是会知道真相的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't like to talk about that barren time with anyone, and especially not Edward. He had only been trying to save me when he'd left, trying to save my soul. I didn't hold him responsible for all the stupid things I'd done in his absence, or the pain I had suffered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不愿意和任何人谈起那一段行尸走肉般的日子，尤其是和爱德华。他离开我只是为了挽救我，挽救我的灵魂。我不会将他不在的时候我所做的蠢事怪罪到他头上，也不能把我所承受的痛苦归咎于他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew I must be patient with Edward. It wasn't that he was unreasonable, it was just that he didn't understand. He had no idea how very much I owed Jacob Black -- my life many times over, and possibly my sanity, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道我必须对爱德华加以耐心，并不是他不讲道理，只是因为他不了解。他不知道我欠雅各布？布莱克的有多么多——有许多次，我的人生都要结束了，很可能我的理智也结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I would have to word my explanation very carefully.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而他却这样认为。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I got up and walked around the table. He opened his arms for me and I sat on his lap, nestling into his cool stone embrace. I looked at his hands while I spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站了起来，绕着桌子走动着，他朝我张开双臂，我则坐在他的腿上，依偎在他如石头般冰冷的怀抱里，我说话的时候看着他的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please just listen for a minute. This is so much more important than some whim to drop in on an old friend. Jacob is in pain." My voice distorted around the word. "I can't not try to help him -- I can't give up on him now, when he needs me. Just because he's not human all the time… Well, he was there for me when I was… not so human myself. You don't know what it was like…" I hesitated. Edward's arms were rigid around me; his hands were in fists now, the tendons standing out. "If Jacob hadn't helped me… I'm not sure what you would have come home to. I owe him better than this, Edward."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请你听我说一下，这件事情非常重要，比某种突然想看看老朋友的冲动要重要得多。雅各布现在很痛苦，”我说这个词的时候声音有些变调了，“我不能不帮他——我现在不能抛弃他，当他需要我的时候。因为他并不总是人类……好吧，当我……当我自己不那么像人类的时候，他在我身边。你不知道这意味着什么……”我犹豫不决地说道，爱德华的手臂在我身边变僵硬起来；现在他双手握拳，青筋暴露，“如果雅各布没有帮助我的话……我不确信你回到家看到的会是什么。我欠他的太多，不该让他承受这些，爱德华。”">查看中文翻译</div>
