<div class="line_en">He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity. Ruined! And by the blundering of the detective! After having steadily traversed that long journey, overcome a hundred obstacles, braved many dangers, and still found time to do some good on his way, to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen, and against which he was unarmed; it was terrible! But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him. There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings, and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club. So great had been the expense of his tour that, even had he won, it would not have enriched him; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself, being a man who rather laid wagers for honour's sake than for the stake proposed. But this wager totally ruined him. Mr. Fogg's course, however, was fully decided upon; he knew what remained for him to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位绅士受了这次打击仍然和往常一样不动声色。他垮台了！都是那笨蛋侦探的罪过！他在这次漫长的旅途中稳步前进，他扫除了无数障碍，经历了无数危险，路上还抽出时间做了些好事，然而，就在大功告成的时候，却碰上了这一场突如其来的祸事，使他一败涂地，不可收拾，这样的结局太可怕了！他离开伦敦时带了那么多钱，如今只剩下一点点儿了。他的全部财产就只是存在巴林兄弟那儿的两万英镑了。而这两万英镑还要付给改良俱乐部的那些会友。按照旅途中他花的这么多钱来说，即使是赌赢了，他也赚不到钱。显然福克先生决不是为赢钱才打赌的，他打赌是为了荣誉；但是这一回要是输了，他就会彻底破产，再说，这位绅士的命运现在已经决定了。他很清楚自己该如何处理善后问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide, Passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master, though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing. First of all, the worthy fellow had gone up to his room, and had extinguished the gas burner, which had been burning for eighty days. He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company, and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense, which he had been doomed to bear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Fogg called him in the morning, and told him to get Aouda's breakfast, and a cup of tea and a chop for himself.

His heart was full, and his conscience tortured by remorse; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Fogg, therefore, had no reason for going out, and so he remained at home. He shut himself up in his room, and busied himself putting his affairs in order. Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs. The hours were long for him. He listened at his master's door, and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do, and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment. Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger. Fix, like all the world, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout… This thought haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Why should he present himself at the Reform? His friends no longer expected him there. As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine), he had lost his wager. It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands, and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit.</div>

The sincerity, rectitude, firmness, and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all, at first astonished, then penetrated him.
