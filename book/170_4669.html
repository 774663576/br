<div class="line_en">"The gods of the north have unleashed their wroth on Lord Stannis," Roose Bolton announced come morning as men gathered in Winterfell's Great Hall to break their fast. "He is a stranger here, and the old gods will not suffer him to live."</div>

<div class="line_en">His men roared their approval, banging their fists on the long plank tables. Winterfell might be ruined, but its granite walls would still keep the worst of the wind and weather at bay. They were well stocked with food and drink; they had fires to warm them when off duty, a place to dry their clothes, snug corners to lie down and sleep. Lord Bolton had laid by enough wood to keep the fires fed for half a year, so the Great Hall was always warm and cozy. Stannis had none of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的人高声欢呼，拳头砸在木头长桌上咚咚作响。临冬城虽然残破不全，但是厚厚的花岗岩城墙足以抵御最猛烈的暴风雪。他们囤足了吃喝，不站岗的时候有暖身的火堆，在那儿可以烘干衣服，躺下去舒舒服服地睡上一觉。剥顿大人存的柴火足够烧上半年，临冬城大厅永远温暖又舒服。这些东西，史坦尼斯没有一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theon Greyjoy did not join the uproar. Neither did the men of House Frey, he did not fail to note. They are strangers here as well, he thought, watching Ser Aenys Frey and his half-brother Ser Hosteen. Born and bred in the riverlands, the Freys had never seen a snow like this. The north has already claimed three of their blood, Theon thought, recalling the men that Ramsay had searched for fruitlessly, lost between White Harbor and Barrowton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩并没有加入欢呼的人群。他注意到弗雷家的人也没有。他们也是外来汉，席恩看着Aenys Frey和他的异母兄弟Hosteen爵士这样想道。弗雷们是土生土长的河间人，从没见过这么大的雪。北境之地已经夺去了他们三个血亲。席恩想起在白港和荒冢屯之间失踪的三个弗雷，拉姆斯找了他们很久，最终无功而返。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the dais, Lord Wyman Manderly sat between a pair of his White Harbor knights, spooning porridge into his fat face. He did not seem to be enjoying it near as much as he had the pork pies at the wedding. Elsewhere one-armed Harwood Stout talked quietly with the cadaverous Whoresbane Umber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在高台上，韦曼·鳗得利大人坐在一双白港骑士之间，将一勺粥送到胖脸前面。比起婚宴上的猪肉派，这顿早餐显然不太合他的胃口。独臂的Harwood Stout坐在一旁，与脸色惨白的Whoresbane Umber小声交谈着什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theon queued up with the other men for porridge, ladled into wooden bowls from a row of copper kettles. The lords and knights had milk and honey and even a bit of butter to sweeten their portions, he saw, but none of that would be offered him. His reign as prince of Winterfell had been a brief one. He had played his part in the mummer's show, giving the feigned Arya to be wed, and now he was of no further use to Roose Bolton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩和其他人一起排着队，用长勺从一排铜壶里打粥喝。大人和骑士们可以在自己的碗里加些牛奶、蜂蜜，甚至是一小块奶油来调味，但是席恩没那个待遇。临冬城亲王的统治早已被草草了结，之后他又粉墨登场，扮演起奈德·史塔克的养子，把假艾丽娅嫁给拉姆斯。现在对剥顿大人来讲，他再没有任何利用价值了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Last night, unable to sleep, Theon had found himself brooding on escape, of slipping away unseen whilst Ramsay and his lord father had their attention elsewhere. Every gate was closed and barred and heavily guarded, though; no one was allowed to enter or depart the castle without Lord Bolton's leave. Even if he found some secret way out, Theon would not have trusted it. He had not forgotten Kyra and her keys. And if he did get out, where would he go? His father was dead, and his uncles had no use for him. Pyke was lost to him. The nearest thing to a home that remained to him was here, amongst the bones of Winterfell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨夜，他发现自己难以成眠，念念不忘逃出生天，想象着自己趁着拉姆斯和他的父亲不注意的时候偷偷溜走，无人觉察。然而每一道大门都上了锁，卫兵们重重把守，没有剥顿大人的许可任何人都不得出入。就算发现了一条密道，他也无法确定那是一条可信的路。他还没忘记凯拉和她的钥匙带来的教训。再说就算是侥幸逃了，又能上哪儿去呢？父亲死了，叔叔们不会帮他的的忙，他失去了派克岛。对他来讲，最像个家的地方就在这里，在临冬城的遗骸里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Arya was not there to share the merriment. She had not been seen outside her chambers since her wedding night. Sour Alyn had been saying that Ramsay kept his bride naked and chained to a bedpost, but Theon knew that was only talk. There were no chains, at least none that men could see. Just a pair of guards outside the bedchamber, to keep the girl from wandering. And she is only naked when she bathes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不在场的艾丽娅夫人却无法分享众人的喜悦。婚礼那晚过后，人们再也没有见过她离开自己的卧室。Sour Alyn说拉姆斯把新娘剥光了锁在床柱上，但是席恩知道那只是谣言。从来都没有什么锁链，起码不是人们看得见的那种。顶多是卧室外面安排两个守卫，防止女孩到处乱跑。她只在洗澡的时候才会脱光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was still waiting for his porridge when Ramsay swept into the hall with his Bastard's Boys, shouting for music. Abel rubbed the sleep from his eyes, took up his lute, and launched into "The Dornishman's Wife," whilst one of his washerwomen beat time on her drum. The singer changed the words, though. Instead of tasting a Dornishman's wife, he sang of tasting a northman's daughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续等着粥的工夫，拉姆斯带着他的私生子伙伴们趾高气昂地走进大厅，嚷着要听歌。亚伯揉去眼里的睡意，抓起鲁特琴，拨起“多恩人的妻子”，一个洗衣妇在旁敲鼓伴奏。歌手改编了歌词，“品尝多恩人的妻子”被唱成了“品尝北方人的女儿”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could lose his tongue for that, Theon thought, as his bowl was being filled. He is only a singer. Lord Ramsay could flay the skin off both his hands, and no one would say a word. But Lord Bolton smiled at the lyric and Ramsay laughed aloud. Then others knew that it was safe to laugh as well. Yellow Dick found the song so funny that wine snorted out his nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他会因此被拔掉舌头。席恩一边想着，一边看着自己的碗被注满。他不过是个歌手，拉姆斯大人会剥掉他双手的皮，没人敢对此说个不字。然而剥顿大人对歌手报以微笑，拉姆斯也纵声大笑。笑是安全的，其他人心领神会，纷纷效仿。黄JJ突然发现这首歌是多么有趣，乐得将刚喝下去的酒全从鼻孔里喷了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Theon…" she whispered, weeping. "Reek." He grabbed her arm and shook her. "In here I'm Reek. You have to remember, Arya." But the girl was no true Stark, only a steward's whelp. Jeyne, her name is Jeyne. She should not look to me for rescue. Theon Greyjoy might have tried to help her, once. But Theon had been ironborn, and a braver man than Reek. Reek, Reek, it rhymes with weak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“席恩…”女孩低声细语，哭泣着。“臭佬。”他抓住她的胳膊摇晃着。“在这儿我是臭佬。一定记着这点，艾丽娅。”但是女孩根本不是史塔克，只是管家的女儿。珍妮，她的名字是珍妮。她不该指望我帮她。如果是席恩·葛雷乔伊，或许能够帮助她。但是席恩是铁种，比臭佬勇敢得多。臭佬，臭佬，押韵疲劳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That she did most every night, though. Lord Ramsay wanted his wife clean. "She has no handmaids, poor thing," he had said to Theon. "That leaves you, Reek. Should I put you in a dress?" He laughed. "Perhaps if you beg it of me. Just now, it will suffice for you to be her bath maid. I won't have her smelling like you." So whenever Ramsay had an itch to bed his wife, it fell to Theon to borrow some servingwomen from Lady Walda or Lady Dustin and fetch hot water from the kitchens. Though Arya never spoke to any of them, they could not fail to see her bruises. It is her own fault. She has not pleased him. "Just be Arya," he told the girl once, as he helped her into the water. "Lord Ramsay does not want to hurt you. He only hurts us when we… when we forget. He never cut me without cause."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可她几乎每晚都要洗澡。拉姆斯大人希望自己的新娘干干净净的。“她还没有侍女，我的小可怜。”他曾对席恩这样说过。“这个任务交给你了，臭佬。或许我该给你换套女仆装？”他大笑。“你求我的话，没准儿我会答应。不过眼下你当个女佣伺候她洗澡就够了，我可不想她闻起来跟你似的。”所以每当拉姆斯打起和老婆上床的主意来，席恩就得到弗雷夫人或者达斯汀夫人那里去借几个女仆，好去厨房里打些热水。尽管艾丽娅从不和这些人说话，她们还是注意到了她身上的瘀伤。这全是她自己的错。都怪她没有好好取悦他。“当好艾丽娅。”有一次扶她进入热水的时候，他这样告诉她。“拉姆斯大人并不想伤你。只有当我们…我们忘记的时候他才会伤害我们。他从不无缘无故地剥我的皮。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took his bowl to the back of the hall and found a place on an empty bench, yards away from the nearest torch. Day or night, the benches below the salt were never less than half-full with men drinking, dicing, talking, or sleeping in their clothes in quiet corners. Their serjeants would kick them awake when it came their turn to shrug back into their cloaks and walk the walls. But no man of them would welcome the company of Theon Turncloak, nor did he have much taste for theirs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他端起碗走向大厅的后方，在一张远离灯火的空长凳上坐了下来。无论白天黑夜，灯下的长凳总是起码被占满一半，人们喝酒，赌博，高谈阔论，或者在安静的角落里和衣而睡。等到轮班的时候，长官就会把睡着的人踢起来，他们把脖子缩进领子里，走上城墙去换岗巡逻。但是任何人都不会欢迎变色龙席恩，席恩也一样不喜欢他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ramsay had a new plaything to amuse him, one with teats and a cunny… but soon Jeyne's tears would lose their savor, and Ramsay would want his Reek again. He will flay me inch by inch. When my fingers are gone he will take my hands. After my toes, my feet. But only when I beg for it, when the pain grows so bad that I plead for him to give me some relief. There would be no hot baths for Reek. He would roll in shit again, forbidden to wash. The clothes he wore would turn to rags, foul and stinking, and he would be made to wear them till they rotted. The best he could hope for was to be returned to the kennels with Ramsay's girls for company. Kyra, he remembered. The new bitch he calls Kyra.</div>

<div class="line_en">The gruel was grey and watery, and he pushed it away after his third spoonful and let it congeal in the bowl. At the next table, men were arguing about the storm and wondering aloud how long the snow would fall. "All day and all night, might be even longer," insisted one big, black-bearded archer with a Cerwyn axe sewn on his breast. A few of the older men spoke of other snowstorms and insisted this was no more than a light dusting compared to what they'd seen in the winters of their youth. The riverlanders were aghast. They have no love of snow and cold, these south-ron swords. Men entering the hall huddled by the fires or clapped their hands together over glowing braziers as their cloaks hung dripping from pegs inside the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the snow was falling still. Wet, heavy, silent, it had already begun to cover the footsteps left by the men coming and going from the hall. The drifts came almost to the top of his boots. It will be deeper in the wolfswood… and out on the kingsroad, where the wind is blowing, there will be no escape from it. A battle was being fought in the yard; Ryswells pelting Barrowton boys with snowballs. Above, he could see some squires building snowmen along the battlements.

<div class="line_en">Theon made his way deeper into the ruined parts of the castle. As he picked through the shattered stone that had once been Maester Luwin's turret, ravens looked down from the gash in the wall above, muttering to one another. From time to time one would let out a raucous scream. He stood in the doorway of a bedchamber that had once been his own (ankle deep in snow that had blown in through a shattered window), visited the ruins of Mikken's forge and Lady Catelyn's sept. Beneath the Burned Tower, he passed Rickard Ryswell nuzzling at the neck of another one of Abel's washerwomen, the plump one with the apple cheeks and pug nose. The girl was barefoot in the snow, bundled up in a fur cloak. He thought she might be naked underneath. When she saw him, she said something to Ryswell that made him laugh aloud.</div>

The outer wall, raised many centuries later, was twenty feet lower, but thicker and in better repair, boasting octagonal towers in place of square ones. Between the two walls was the moat, deep and wide… and frozen. Drifts of snow had begun to creep across its icy surface.

If he does, his cause is doomed. The castle was too strong. Even with the moat frozen over, Winterfell's defenses remained formidable.

His knights rode destriers, and the big warhorses were foundering in the snow. The small, sure-footed garrons of the hill clans were faring better, the scouts said, but the clansmen dared not press too far ahead or the whole host would come apart.
