<div class="line_en">Of course, she said to herself, coming into the room, she had to come here to get something she wanted. First she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp. But she wanted something more, though she did not know, could not think what it was that she wanted. She looked at her husband (taking up her stocking and beginning to knit), and saw that he did not want to be interrupted -- that was clear. He was reading something that moved him very much. He was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion. He was tossing the pages over. He was acting it -- perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book. She wondered what book it was. Oh, it was one of old Sir Walter's she saw, adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting. For Charles Tansley had been saying (she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above), had been saying that people don't read Scott any more. Then her husband thought, "That's what they'll say of me;" so he went and got one of those books. And if he came to the conclusion "That's true" what Charles Tansley said, he would accept it about Scott. (She could see that he was weighing, considering, putting this with that as he read.) But not about himself. He was always uneasy about himself. That troubled her. He would always be worrying about his own books -- will they be read, are they good, why aren't they better, what do people think of me? Not liking to think of him so, and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting, wondering if the children were laughing at that, she twitched the stockings out, and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead, and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now, when the breeze falls, settles, leaf by leaf, into quiet.</div>

<div class="line_en">It didn't matter, any of it, she thought. A great man, a great book, fame -- who could tell? She knew nothing about it. But it was his way with him, his truthfulness -- for instance at dinner she had been thinking quite instinctively, If only he would speak! She had complete trust in him. And dismissing all this, as one passes in diving now a weed, now a straw, now a bubble, she felt again, sinking deeper, as she had felt in the hall when the others were talking, There is something I want -- something I have come to get, and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was, with her eyes closed. And she waited a little, knitting, wondering, and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner, "the China rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee," began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically, and as they washed, words, like little shaded lights, one red, one blue, one yellow, lit up in the dark of her mind, and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across, or to cry out and to be echoed; so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.</div>

<div class="line_en">Steer, hither steer your winged pines, all beaten Mariners she read and turned the page, swinging herself, zigzagging this way and that, from one line to another as from one branch to another, from one red and white flower to another, until a little sound roused her -- her husband slapping his thighs. Their eyes met for a second; but they did not want to speak to each other. They had nothing to say, but something seemed, nevertheless, to go from him to her. It was the life, it was the power of it, it was the tremendous humour, she knew, that made him slap his thighs. Don't interrupt me, he seemed to be saying, don't say anything; just sit there. And he went on reading. His lips twitched. It filled him. It fortified him. He clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening, and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably, and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they didn't exist at all. But now, he felt, it didn't matter a damn who reached Z (if thought ran like an alphabet from A to Z). Somebody would reach it -- if not he, then another. This man's strength and sanity, his feeling for straight forward simple things, these fishermen, the poor old crazed creature in Mucklebackit's cottage made him feel so vigorous, so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back his tears. Raising the book a little to hide his face, he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely (but not one or two reflections about morality and French novels and English novels and Scott's hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view), forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor Steenie's drowning and Mucklebackit's sorrow (that was Scott at his best) and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“掌好舵，精疲力竭的水手们，驾着你们的松木小船向这里疾驶。”她读完，翻过一页，摆动着身体，曲折前行，从一行跳向另一行，就像从一根树枝跳向另一根树枝，从一朵红白相间的花转向另一朵红白相间的花，一直到一个轻微的声音惊醒了她——那是她的丈夫拍了一下腿。他们的目光在片刻间相遇；但他们不想谈话。他们无话可说，然而仍似乎有某种东西从他传递到了她那儿。她知道，是那本书的生命力，是它的力量，是它那惊人的幽默使他拍起腿来。他似乎在说，不要打扰我，什么也别说，就坐着别动。而他继续读了下去。他的嘴唇在抽动。书全部占据了他，使他坚强。他完全忘记了那晚所有琐碎的嘲笑和挖苦，忘记了干坐在那里看人家没完没了地又吃又喝时那无以言状的无聊，忘记了他对妻子多么烦躁易怒以及当大家忽略不提他的作品、好像它们根本不存在似的，他是多么敏感多么介意。现在他觉得，谁到达Z根本不重要（如果思想也像字母表那样是从A进到Z的话）。总有人会到达Z的——如果不是他，就是另一个人。司各特这位作家的力量和清醒的头脑、他对简单朴素的事物的好感、他笔下的渔民、穆克尔巴基待茅屋中那个可怜的老疯子，这一切都使他感到充满了力量、感到某种解脱，因而产生了振奋和胜利的喜悦之情，使他无法忍住自己的眼泪。他把书举高了一点挡住了脸，听任眼泪流个不住；他左右晃动着脑袋，完全忘记了自己的存在（但并没有忘记一两点想法：关于道德、法国小说和英国小说、司各特不能放手写作，但他的观点也许和另一个观点同样正确）；可怜的斯蒂尼被淹死和穆爽尔巴基持的哀伤（这是司各特最拿手的描写）以及小说所给予他的惊人的愉快和强烈的振奋感使他完全忘记了自己的烦恼和失败。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And all the lives we ever lived And all the lives to be, Are full of trees and changing leaves," she murmured, sticking her needles into the stocking. And she opened the book and began reading here and there at random, and as she did so, she felt that she was climbing backwards, upwards, shoving her way up under petals that curved over her, so that she only knew this is white, or this is red. She did not know at first what the words meant at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, let them improve upon that, he thought as he finished the chapter. He felt that he had been arguing with somebody, and had got the better of him. They could not improve upon that, whatever they might say; and his own position became more secure. The lovers were fiddlesticks, he thought, collecting it all in his mind again. That's fiddlesticks, that's first-rate, he thought, putting one thing beside another. But he must read it again. He could not remember the whole shape of the thing. He had to keep his judgement in suspense. So he returned to the other thought -- if young men did not care for this, naturally they did not care for him either. One ought not to complain, thought Mr Ramsay, trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him. But he was determined; he would not bother her again. Here he looked at her reading. She looked very peaceful, reading. He liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone. The whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman, he thought, returning to Scott and Balzac, to the English novel and the French novel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，让他们来改进一下试试，他读完这一章时心里想道。他感到自己一直在和什么人辩论，现在占了上风。不管他们怎么说，他们根本不可能改进这部作品；他自己的地位也变得更稳固了。那些情人们写得不怎么样，他在心里把内容更新回忆一遍，这样想道。哪个不怎么样，哪个是第一流的，他把书中各个部分放在一起比较时想。但是他必须再读一遍。他记不得小说的整体情况了。他只好暂时先不作判断。于是他的思想回到了另外那个问题上——如果年轻人不喜欢这样的书，那么自然他们也不会喜欢他的作品。他不应该抱怨，拉姆齐先生想，一面努力压下想向妻子抱怨年轻人不赞赏他的愿望。他已经决意不再打搅她。这时他看着她读书，她读书时的样子非常安详。他想到大家都出去了，只剩下他们俩单独在一起，很是高兴。他想，男欢女爱并不是生活的全部意义，思绪又回到了司各特和巴尔扎克、回到了英国和法国小说上。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was smiling at her, quizzically, as if he were ridiculing her gently for being asleep in broad daylight, but at the same time he was thinking, Go on reading. You don't look sad now, he thought. And he wondered what she was reading, and exaggerated her ignorance, her simplicity, for he liked to think that she was not clever, not book-learned at all. He wondered if she understood what she was reading. Probably not, he thought. She was astonishingly beautiful. Her beauty seemed to him, if that were possible, to increase</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她逐渐意识到丈夫在看她。他好奇地对她微笑着，仿佛是在温柔地嘲笑她竟在光天化日之下睡着了，但同时他又在想，接着看下去吧。你现在看上去不伤感了，他想。他琢磨着，不知道她看的是什么书，他夸大了她的无知，她的单纯，因为他喜欢认为她脑子并不聪明，毫无书本知识。他心想不知她是否看得懂在读的东西。大概不懂，他想。她美丽得惊人。对他来说，如果这种事是可能的话，她的美似乎是越来越增加了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What had happened, she wondered, as she took up her knitting, since she had seen him alone?

He found talking so much easier than she did. He could say things -- she never could. So naturally it was always he that said the things, and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly, and would reproach her. A heartless woman he called her; she never told him that she loved him. But it was not so -- it was not so. It was only that she never could say what she felt. Was there no crumb on his coat? Nothing she could do for him? Getting up, she stood at the window with the reddish-brown stocking in her hands, partly to turn away from him, partly because she remembered how beautiful it often is -- the sea at night. But she knew that he had turned his head as she turned; he was watching her. She knew that he was thinking, You are more beautiful than ever. And she felt herself very beautiful. Will you not tell me just for once that you love me? He was thinking that, for he was roused, what with Minta and his book, and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the Lighthouse. But she could not do it; she could not say it. Then, knowing that he was watching her, instead of saying anything she turned, holding her stocking, and looked at him.
