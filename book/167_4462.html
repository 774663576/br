<div class="line_en">Sansa tried to hurry, but her fingers fumbled at buttons and knots. The Hound was always rough-tongued, but something in the way he had looked at her filled her with dread. Had Joffrey found out about her meetings with Ser Dontos? Please no, she thought as she brushed out her hair. Ser Dontos was her only hope. I have to look pretty, foff likes me to look pretty, he's always liked me in this gown, this color. She smoothed the cloth down. The fabric was tight across her chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hound snorted. "They trained you well, little bird." He conducted her to the lower bailey, where a crowd had gathered around the archery butts. Men moved aside to let them through. She could hear Lord Gyles coughing. Loitering stablehands eyed her insolently, but Ser Horas Redwyne averted his gaze as she passed, and his brother Hobber pretended not to see her. A yellow cat was dying on the ground, mewling piteously, a crossbow quarrel through its ribs. Sansa stepped around it, feeling ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎狗嗤之以鼻，“小小鸟，他们把你训练得真不错。”他领她走到下层庭院，靶场中聚集了一群人。一见他俩，人们忙不迭地让路。她听到盖尔斯伯爵的咳嗽，发现游荡的马夫们无礼地看着她，但霍拉斯·雷德温爵士在她经过时别开了脸，而他弟弟霍伯则假装没看到她。一只垂死的黄猫躺在地上，被弩箭穿透了肋骨，可怜地喵喵叫。珊莎绕开它，感到一阵恶心。">查看中文翻译</div>

"I'd shoot you too, but if I do Mother says they'd kill my uncle Jaime. Instead you'll just be punished and we'll send word to your brother about what will happen to you if he doesn't yield. Dog, hit her."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let me beat her!" Ser Dontos shoved forward, tin armor clattering. He was armed with a "morningstar" whose head was a melon. My Florian. She could have kissed him, blotchy skin and broken veins and all. He trotted his broomstick around her, shouting "Traitor, traitor" and whacking her over the head with the melon. Sansa covered herself with her hands, staggering every time the fruit pounded her, her hair sticky by the second blow. People were laughing. The melon flew to pieces. Laugh, Joffrey, she prayed as the juice ran down her face and the front of her blue silk gown. Laugh and be satisfied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我来打她！”唐托斯爵士挤到前面，锡制盔甲叮当作响。他手拿流星锤，顶端却是个甜瓜。我的佛罗理安。她满心感激，直想亲吻他满是污斑和琐碎血管的丑陋脸庞。他骑着扫帚，围着她打转，口中高喊“叛徒，叛徒”，并用甜瓜砸她的脑袋。珊莎举手遮挡，每当甜瓜砸到身上，便作势摇晃，砸了两下，她的头发已经粘乎乎。人们哈哈大笑。最后甜瓜裂成碎片，飞散开来。你笑啊，乔佛里，她祈祷着，果汁流下她的脸，流下她美丽的蓝色裙服，你就笑个够，然后放过我吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

When she doubled over, the knight grabbed her hair and drew his sword, and for one hideous instant she was certain he meant to open her throat.

<div class="line_en">Some serving girls took charge of her, mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her shaking. One stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes, and another bathed her and washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair. As they scrubbed her down with soap and sluiced warm water over her head, all she could see were the faces from the bailey. Knights are sworn to defend the weak, protect women, and fight for the right, but none of them did a thing. Only Ser Dontos had tried to help, and he was no longer a knight, no more than the Imp was, nor the Hound… the Hound hated knights… I hate them too, Sansa thought.

Your brother had his direwolf with him, but I suspect that's as far as it went. The northmen crept into my uncle's camp and cut his horse lines, and Lord Stark sent his wolf among them. Even war-trained destriers went mad. Knights were trampled to death in their pavilions, and the rabble woke in terror and fled, casting aside their weapons to run the faster. Ser Stafford was slain as he chased after a horse. Lord Rickard Karstark drove a lance through his chest. Ser Rubert Brax is also dead, along with Ser Lymond Vikary, Lord Crakehall, and Lord jast. Half a hundred more have been taken captive, including jast's sons and my nephew Martyn Lannister.
