<div class="line_en">The matter was simple; Claude Frollo had taken him in, had adopted him, had nourished him, had reared him. When a little lad, it was between Claude Frollo's legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the dogs and the children barked after him. Claude Frollo had taught him to talk, to read, to write. Claude Frollo had finally made him the bellringer. Now, to give the big bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, there was one human creature whom Quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more, perhaps, than his cathedral: this was Claude Frollo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，有一个人，卡席莫多把他排除在对于一切人的恶意和仇恨之外，爱他比爱主教堂也许犹有过之。那就是克洛德·弗罗洛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hence Quasimodo's gratitude was profound, passionate, boundless; and although the visage of his adopted father was often clouded or severe, although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that gratitude never wavered for a single moment. The archdeacon had in Quasimodo the most submissive slave, the most docile lackey, the most vigilant of dogs. When the poor bellringer became deaf, there had been established between him and Claude Frollo, a language of signs, mysterious and understood by themselves alone. In this manner the archdeacon was the sole human being with whom Quasimodo had preserved communication. He was in sympathy with but two things in this world: Notre-Dame and Claude Frollo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，卡席莫多的感激之情是深沉、热烈、无限的；尽管养父的脸上时常乌云密布，时常声色俱厉，尽管养父的言词惯常简短、生硬、专横，他那感激之情却一刻也未曾稍减。卡席莫多对于副主教，就是最卑顺的奴隶、最听话的仆人、最警觉的猛犬。可怜的敲钟人聋了以后，他和克洛德·弗罗洛之间建立了一种只有他俩懂得的神秘的手势语。这样，副主教就是卡席莫多还保持着交往的唯一的人。在这个世界上，他只与两个东西有关系：一个是圣母院，一个是克洛德·弗罗洛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There is nothing which can be compared with the empire of the archdeacon over the bellringer; with the attachment of the bellringer for the archdeacon. A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre-Dame. It was a remarkable thing -- all that physical strength which had reached in Quasimodo such an extraordinary development, and which was placed by him blindly at the disposition of another. There was in it, no doubt, filial devotion, domestic attachment; there was also the fascination of one spirit by another spirit. It was a poor, awkward, and clumsy organization, which stood with lowered head and supplicating eyes before a lofty and profound, a powerful and superior intellect. Lastly, and above all, it was gratitude. Gratitude so pushed to its extremest limit, that we do not know to what to compare it. This virtue is not one of those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men. We will say then, that Quasimodo loved the archdeacon as never a dog, never a horse, never an elephant loved his master.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么也比不上副主教对打钟人的支配力量，什么也比不上打钟人对副主教的依恋。只要克洛德一招手，只要一想到一定要讨他的喜欢，卡席莫多就立即从圣母院钟楼上冲下来。卡席莫多的体力发达到那样非凡的程度，他却那样盲目交由另一人支配，这真是异乎寻常的事情。这里面当然包含着儿子般的孝顺、奴婢般的依恋；也包含着一个灵魂对另一个灵魂的魔力。这是一个可怜的、拙劣的、笨拙的机体，对另一个高傲、深湛、有力、优异的智慧俯首帖耳、垂目乞怜。最后，超乎这一切的，是感恩戴德。推至极限的感激之情，简直无法比拟。这是这样的一种美德：它的最优美楷模不是人类中间所能觅得的。所以我们说，卡席莫多爱副主教，甚至狗、马、大象爱其主也不能相比。">查看中文翻译</div>
