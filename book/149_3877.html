<div class="line_en">It had snowed massively all along the Norrland coast between Christmas and New Year's, and judging by the ridges and piles of snow thrown up by the ploughs, the road teams had been out in full force in Hedestad. The taxi driver, whose name, according to his ID posted on the window, was Hussein, nodded when Blomkvist asked whether they had been having rough weather. In the broadest Norrland accent, he reported that it had been the worst snowstorm in decades, and he bitterly regretted not taking his holiday in Greece over the Christmas period.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Blomkvist alighted from his train in Hedestad for the second time, the sky was a pastel blue and the air icy cold. The thermometer on the wall of the station said 0°F. He was wearing unsuitable walking shoes. Unlike on his previous visit, there was no Herr Frode waiting with a warm car. Blomkvist had told them which day he would arrive, but not on which train. He assumed there was a bus to Hedeby, but he did not feel like struggling with two heavy suitcases and a shoulder bag, so he crossed the square to the taxi stand.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the conditions in his negotiations with Vanger and Dirch Frode had been that he have living quarters where he could do his own housekeeping and come and go as he pleased. Vanger led Blomkvist back along the road towards the bridge and then turned to open the gate to another newly shovelled courtyard in front of a small timbered house close to the end of the bridge. The house was not locked. They stepped into a modest hallway where Blomkvist, with a sigh of relief, put down his suitcases.</div>

<div class="line_en">Blomkvist looked around. Windows faced three different directions, and from the kitchen table he had a view of the bridge, about a hundred feet away. The furnishings in the kitchen included three big cupboards, some kitchen chairs, an old bench, and a shelf for newspapers. On top was an issue of See from 1967. In one corner was a smaller table that could be used as a desk.</div>

<div class="line_en">The old man started the tour by explaining that Blomkvist's neighbour across the road was Gunnar Nilsson, the assistant whom Vanger insisted on calling "the caretaker."

<div class="line_cn" title="老人一开始先介绍对街邻居根纳·尼尔森，他是范耶尔的助理，范耶尔总是称呼他“管理员”。不过布隆维斯特很快便发现他应该是海泽比岛上所有建筑的总监督，而赫德史塔也有几间屋子由他负责。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好极了。离天黑大约还有一小时，我们出去走走顺便让你熟悉一下环境好吗？建议你最好穿上厚袜和靴子。前门旁边就有。”布隆维斯特听取他的建议，并决定隔天去买长内衣和一双好的冬鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vanger paused for a moment to shape what he would say next, which was: "Mikael, the official explanation for your presence here is that you're going to help me write my autobiography.

There's one question that I never got answered -- Harriet and Gunnar were good friends, and I think some sort of childish romance went on between them. He was pretty interested in her, at any rate. But on the day she disappeared, he was in Hedestad; he was one of those stranded on the mainland. Because of their relationship, he came under close scrutiny. It was quite unpleasant for him. He was with some friends all day, and he didn't get back here until evening. The police checked his alibi and it was airtight."</div>

It was a rectangular, two-storey stone building which at first glance seemed unoccupied.

Probably not. He had bought the book because the publisher had hailed the first-time novelist as "a new Carina Rydberg." He quickly ascertained that this was not the case in either style or content.

<div class="line_en">The bus stop for Hedestad was over the road from Konsum, and Blomkvist started off his exile by carrying out his plan to go shopping in town. He got off the bus by the railway station and made a tour of the centre of town. Along the way he bought heavy winter boots, two pairs of long underwear, several flannel shirts, a proper thigh-length winter jacket, a warm cap, and lined gloves. At the electronics store he found a small portable TV with rabbit ears. The sales clerk assured him that he would at least be able to get SVT, the state TV channel, out at Hedeby, and Blomkvist promised to ask for his money back if that turned out not to be the case.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally he bought a pack of cigarettes. He had stopped smoking ten years ago, but occasionally he would have a relapse. He stuck the pack in his jacket pocket without opening it.

<div class="line_en">The Nilssons were pleasant people. They did not seem curious about why Blomkvist was in Hedestad -- the fact that he was working for Henrik Vanger was evidently enough of an explanation. Blomkvist observed the interaction between the Nilssons and Vanger, concluding that it was relaxed and lacking in any sort of gulf between master and servants. They talked about the village and the man who had built the guest house where Blomkvist was living. The Nilssons would prompt Vanger when his memory failed him. He, on the other hand, told a funny story about how Nilsson had come home one night to discover the village idiot from across the bridge trying to break a window at the guest house. Nilsson went over to ask the half-witted delinquent why he didn't go in through the unlocked front door. Nilsson inspected Blomkvist's little TV with misgiving and invited him to come across to their house if there was ever a programme he wanted to see.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="再次落单后，布隆维斯特将纸箱搬进工作室，然后列出清单。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vanger's investigation into the disappearance of his brother's granddaughter had been going on for thirty-six years. Blomkvist wondered whether this was an unhealthy obsession or whether, over the years, it had developed into an intellectual game. What was clear was that the old patriarch had tackled the job with the systematic approach of an amateur archaeologist -- the material was going to fill twenty feet of shelving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="范耶尔调查哥哥孙女的失踪案已长达三十六年。布隆维斯特不知道这究竟是一种不健康的偏执心理，或者经过这么多年，已经发展成一个脑力游戏。但很明显地，这位老家长是以业余考古学家一丝不苟的方式在进行这项工作——所有的数据足以填满七公尺长的架子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there were scrapbooks, photograph albums, maps, texts about Hedestad and the Vanger firm, Harriet's diary (though it did not contain many pages), her schoolbooks, medical certificates. There were sixteen bound A4 volumes of one hundred or so pages each, which were Vanger's logbook of the investigations. In these notebooks he had recorded in an impeccable hand his own speculations, theories, digressions. Blomkvist leafed through them. The text had a literary quality, and he had the feeling that these texts were fair copies of perhaps many more notebooks. There were ten binders containing material on members of the Vanger family; these pages were typed and had been compiled over the intervening years, Vanger's investigations of his own family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他还有剪贴簿、相簿、地图、关于赫德史塔与范耶尔公司的文章、海莉的日记（但页数不多）、她的课本、医疗诊断书。另外还有十六本以A4纸张装订而成、每本约一百页的簿子，是范耶尔自己的调查笔记，他在里头以工整的字体记录自己的推测、理论与不相干的想法。布隆维斯特快速地翻阅。里头的文字带有一种文学气息，他觉得这些可能是从其他更多笔记本中誊写下来的。有十个讲义夹装了有关范耶尔家族成员的资料，内容是用打字机打的，是这许多年来范耶尔对自己亲人的调查所累积的成果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The largest section of it consisted of twenty-six binders, which were the copies of the police investigation. Hard to believe an ordinary missing-person case would have produced such comprehensive material. Vanger no doubt had enough clout to keep the Hedestad police following up both plausible and implausible leads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中最大部分是警方调查报告的复印件，分装在二十六个讲义夹里。一宗普通的人口失踪案竟能搜集到如此完整的资料，实在令人难以置信。范耶尔无疑具有足够的影响力，能让赫德史塔警方持续追踪所有可信与不可信的线索。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just before midnight he put on warm clothes and his new shoes and walked across the bridge. He turned off the road and along the sound below the church. Ice had formed on the sound and inside the old harbour, but farther out he could see a darker belt of open water. As he stood there, the lights on the facade of the church went out, and it was dark all around him. It was icy cold and stars filled the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="近午夜时，他穿上厚衣新鞋走到桥的另一头，转上岔路沿着教堂下方的海湾走。海湾和旧港内已经结冰，但望向远处可以看见一长条颜色较深、未结冰的海水。他站在那里时，教堂外的灯熄灭了，四周一片漆黑。空气凛寒，天上星斗密布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Had it been daylight, he would have walked straight to Vanger's house, cancelled his contract, and gone home. But from the rise beside the church he could make out all the houses on the island side. Harald Vanger's house was dark, but there were lights on in Cecilia's home, as well as in Martin's villa out by the point and in the house that was leased. In the small-boat harbour there were lights on in the draughty cabin of the artist and little clouds of sparks were rising from his chimney. There were also lights on in the top floor of the café, and Blomkvist wondered whether Susanne lived there, and if so, whether she was alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻若是白天，他会直接上范耶尔住处取消合约，然后回家。但从教堂旁边的高地，可以看出范耶尔主屋已经熄灯且悄然无声。从教堂可以看到岛上所有屋子。哈洛德的屋里没有灯光，但西西莉亚的家却是亮的，还有马丁位于岬角边的别墅和那间出租房子也一样。在游艇码头处，画家的破旧木屋也亮着灯，还有少许的煤屑烟尘从烟囱冒出。另外尚未熄灯的还有咖啡馆顶楼，布隆维斯特不禁暗想苏珊是否住在那里，又是否独自一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All of a sudden Blomkvist felt depressed. He could not for the life of him understand how he had allowed Vanger to talk him into taking on this assignment. Berger was right: he should be in Stockholm -- in bed with her, for instance -- and planning his campaigns against Wennerström. But he felt apathetic about that too, and he didn't even have the faintest idea how to begin planning a counter-strategy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间，布隆维斯特感到沮丧。他这辈子恐怕都无法理解自己怎么会让范耶尔说服，接下这项任务。爱莉卡说得对：他应该在斯德哥尔摩——也许在她床上——计划如何对付温纳斯壮。但对此他也不感兴趣，他甚至毫无概念该从何着手计划反制策略。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On Sunday morning he awoke in panic at the incredible din that filled the guest house. It took him a second to get his bearings and realise that it was the church bells summoning parishioners to morning service. It was nearly 11:00. He stayed in bed until he heard an urgent meowing in the doorway and got up to let out the cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期日清晨，宾馆内响起不可思议的嘈杂声将他惊醒。过了一会儿，他才想起自己身在何处，也才发现那是教堂召唤教区信徒作晨祷的钟声。已将近十一点。他继续躺在床上，直到听见门口传来急促的喵鸣声，才下床开门放猫出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By noon he had showered and eaten breakfast. He went resolutely into his office and took down the first binder from the police investigation. Then he hesitated. From the gable window he could see Susanne's Bridge Café. He stuffed the binder into his shoulder bag and put on his outdoor clothes. When he reached the café, he found it brimming with customers, and there he had the answer to a question that had been in the back of his mind: how could a café survive in a backwater like Hedeby? Susanne specialised in churchgoers and presumably did coffee and cakes for funerals and other functions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了中午，他已经淋浴过也吃了早餐。他毅然决然走进工作室，取下第一本警方调查报告的讲义夹，这时他又犹豫了。从山形墙的窗口可以看到苏珊桥头咖啡馆。于是他将讲义夹塞进肩背包，穿上外出服。到了咖啡馆，发现里头挤满客人，他内心一直狐疑的问题终于获得解答：在海泽比这种鸟不生蛋的地方，咖啡馆怎么生存？苏珊专做上教堂的人的生意，或许也会为丧礼与其他集会场合供应咖啡与糕点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a walk instead. Konsum was closed on Sundays, and he continued a few hundred yards towards Hedestad, where he bought newspapers at a petrol station. He spent an hour walking around Hedeby, familiarising himself with the town before the bridge. The area closest to the church and past Konsum was the centre, with older buildings -- two-storey stone structures which Blomkvist guessed had been built in the 1910s or '20s and which formed a short main street. North of the road into town were well-kept apartment buildings for families with children. Along the water and to the south of the church were mostly single-family homes. Hedeby looked to be a relatively well-to-do area for Hedestad's decision-makers and civil servants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有进去，转而在外头散散步。昆萨姆超市星期天没有营业，他又继续往赫德史塔方向走几百公尺，在一间加油站买了报纸。他在海泽比晃了一个小时，让自己多熟悉桥头前的城区。过了昆萨姆超市，离教堂最近的地区是城中心，较老旧的建筑——布隆维斯特猜测这些两层楼石材建筑应该建于一九一○或二○年代——形成一条短短的大街。进城道路北侧多为维护妥善的公寓建筑，住的都是有小孩的家庭。海岸边和教堂南侧则多半是独立住宅。海泽比看起来应该是赫德史塔的高层决策者与公务员居住的相当富裕的地区。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was no room for him in Harald's car, so he had taken the train home to Hedeby, arriving so late that he was stranded on the wrong side of the bridge accident and could not cross until late in the evening by boat. He was interviewed in the hope that his sister might have confided in him and perhaps given him some clue if she was thinking of running away. The question was met with protests from Harriet Vanger's mother, but at that moment Inspector Morell was perhaps thinking that Harriet's having run away would be the best they could hope for.

<div class="line_en">While Inspector Morell was interviewing family members, he had told Magnusson and Bergman -- patrol 014-- to organise the first search party while there was still daylight. The bridge was still closed to traffic, so it was difficult to call in reinforcements. The group consisted of about thirty available individuals, men and women of varying ages. The areas they searched that afternoon included the unoccupied houses at the fishing harbour, the shoreline at the point and along the sound, the section of woods closest to the village, and the hill called Söderberget behind the fishing harbour. The latter was searched because someone had put forward the theory that Harriet might have gone up there to get a good view of the scene on the bridge. Patrols were also sent out to Östergården and to Gottfried's cabin on the other side of the island, which Harriet occasionally visited.</div>

<div class="line_en">Blomkvist could vividly imagine the scenes played out at the Vanger estate during those days. The accident on the bridge had certainly contributed to the confusion during the first hours -- by making it difficult to bring in reinforcements, and also because people somehow thought that these two dramatic events happening at the same place and close to the same time must in some way have been connected. When the tanker truck was hoisted away, Inspector Morell went down to the bridge to be sure that Harriet Vanger had not, by some unlikely turn of events, ended up under the wreck. That was the only irrational action that Mikael could detect in the inspector's conduct, since the missing girl had unquestionably been seen on the island after the accident had occurred.</div>

Instead, they were gradually replaced by two theories. In spite of the obvious difficulties in leaving the island unnoticed, Morell refused to discount the possibility that she had run away. He decided that an all-points bulletin should be sent out for Harriet Vanger, and he gave instructions for the patrol officers in Hedestad to keep their eyes open for the missing girl. He also sent a colleague in the criminal division to interview bus drivers and staff at the railway station, to find out whether anyone might have seen her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The big search party two days after her disappearance was apparently, as far as Blomkvist could tell, carried out effectively. Police and firefighters who had experience with similar operations had organised the search. Hedeby Island did have some parts that were almost inaccessible, but it was nevertheless a small area, and the island was searched with a fine- tooth comb in one day. A police boat and two volunteer Pettersson boats did what they could to search the waters around the island.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the following day the search was continued with decreased manpower. Patrols were sent out to make a second sweep of the particularly rugged terrain, as well as an area known as "the fortress"-- a now-abandoned bunker system that was built during the Second World War. That day they also searched cubbyholes, wells, vegetable cellars, outhouses, and attics in the village.</div>
