<div class="line_en">I loved that district. It is one of those delightful spots which have a sensuous charm for the eyes. You love it with a physical love. We, whom the country enchants, keep tender memories of certain springs, certain woods, certain pools, certain hills seen very often which have stirred us like joyful events. Sometimes our thoughts turn back to a corner in a forest, or the end of a bank, or an orchard filled with flowers, seen but a single time on some bright day, yet remaining in our hearts like the image of certain women met in the street on a spring morning in their light, gauzy dresses, leaving in soul and body an unsatisfied desire which is not to be forgotten, a feeling that you have just passed by happiness.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Virelogne I loved the whole countryside, dotted with little woods and crossed by brooks which sparkled in the sun and looked like veins carrying blood to the earth. You fished in them for crawfish, trout and eels. Divine happiness! You could bathe in places and you often found snipe among the high grass which grew along the borders of these small water courses.</div>

<div class="line_en">I also recalled that inside its doors, after a very tiring day, the good woman had given me a glass of wine to drink and that Serval had told me the history of its people. The father, an old poacher, had been killed by the gendarmes. The son, whom I had once seen, was a tall, dry fellow who also passed for a fierce slayer of game. People called them "Les Sauvage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也记起了某一天我在很乏的时候，曾经有一位老妇人请我到那里面喝过一杯葡萄酒，并且塞华尔当时也对我谈过那些住在里面的人的经历。老妇人的丈夫是个以私自打猎为生的，早被保安警察打死。她的儿子，我从前也看见过，一个瘦高个子，也像是一个打猎的健将，这一家子，大家都叫他们做“蛮子”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She remained entirely alone in that isolated dwelling, so far from the village, on the edge of the wood. She was not afraid, however, being of the same strain as the men folk -- a hardy old woman, tall and thin, who seldom laughed and with whom one never jested. The women of the fields laugh but little in any case, that is men's business. But they themselves have sad and narrowed hearts, leading a melancholy, gloomy life. The peasants imbibe a little noisy merriment at the tavern, but their helpmates always have grave, stern countenances. The muscles of their faces have never learned the motions of laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她单独一人留在这所房子里了，那是座落在树林子边上并且和村子相隔很远的一所房子。她并不害怕，此外，她的气性和那父子两个是一般无二的，一个严气正性的老太太，又长又瘦，不常露笑容，人们也绝不敢和她闹着耍。并且农家妇人们素来是不大笑的。在乡下，笑是男人们的事情！因为生活是晦暗没有光彩的，所以她们的心境都窄，都打不开。男人们在小酒店里，学得了一点儿热闹的快活劲儿，他们家里的伙伴却始终板起一副严肃的面孔。她们脸上的筋肉还没有学惯那种笑的动作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother Sauvage continued her ordinary existence in her cottage, which was soon covered by the snows. She came to the village once a week to get bread and a little meat. Then she returned to her house. As there was talk of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder -- her son's gun, rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand -- and she was a strange sight, the tall "Sauvage," a little bent, going with slow strides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the black headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair, which no one had ever seen.</div>

Alone with this aged woman, they showed themselves full of consideration, sparing her, as much as they could, all expense and fatigue. They could be seen, all four of them, making their toilet at the well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn, splashing with great swishes of water their pink-white northern skin, while La Mere Sauvage went and came, preparing their soup.

<div class="line_en">They invariably answered, "No, we don't know, don't know a thing at all." And, understanding her pain and her uneasiness -- they who had mothers, too, there at home -- they rendered her a thousand little services. She loved them well, moreover, her four enemies, since the peasantry have no patriotic hatred; that belongs to the upper class alone. The humble, those who pay the most because they are poor and because every new burden crushes them down; those who are killed in masses, who make the true cannon's prey because they are so many; those, in fine, who suffer most cruelly the atrocious miseries of war because they are the feeblest and offer least resistance -- they hardly understand at all those bellicose ardors, that excitable sense of honor or those pretended political combinations which in six months exhaust two nations, the conqueror with the conquered.</div>

She would never kiss him again, her child, her big boy, never again! The gendarmes had killed the father, the Prussians had killed the son. He had been cut in two by a cannon-ball. She seemed to see the thing, the horrible thing: the head falling, the eyes open, while he chewed the corner of his big mustache as he always did in moments of anger.</div>
