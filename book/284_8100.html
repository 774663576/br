<div class="line_en">Of course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after Colin had had his tantrum. He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his bed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested the difficulties of these visits. On this occasion he was away from Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柯林发威后第二天早上，当然有人去请克兰文医生来。当这种事发生，总是马上有人去请他，他总是发现，当他抵达时，一个苍白、颤抖之后的男孩躺在床上，愠怒、仍然歇斯底里，随时准备为只言片语爆发抽泣、再来一场。其实，克兰文医生畏惧、反感这些棘手的出诊。这一次，他离米瑟韦斯特庄园远远的，直到下午。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How is he?" he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived. "He will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The boy is half insane with hysteria and self-indulgence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他怎么了？”他抵达时，相当恼怒地问莫得劳克太太。“有一天，哪场脾气就要让他裂破自己的血管。这个孩子是半疯的，因为歇斯底里、自我纵容。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, sir," answered Mrs. Medlock, "you'll scarcely believe your eyes when you see him. That plain sour-faced child that's almost as bad as himself has just bewitched him. How she's done it there's no telling. The Lord knows she's nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her speak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just flew at him like a little cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop screaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop, and this afternoon-well, just come up and see, sir. It's past crediting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，先生，”莫得劳克太太回答，“等你看到他，你会难以相信自己的眼睛。那个乏味的、苦瓜脸的孩子，和他自己差不多一样坏，就白白地魔住了他。她怎么干的，没法形容。老天知道，她没啥好看，你几乎听不到她说话，但是她干了我们谁都不敢干的。昨晚上，她就像头小猫似的冲他扑过去，跺着脚命令他停止尖叫，不知怎的她就震住了他，他竟然真的停下了，今天下午——嗯，过来看看，先生。实在难以置信。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient's room was indeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door he heard laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in his dressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture in one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that moment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so glowing with enjoyment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克兰文医生进入他的病人的门时所见的一幕，着实震惊了他。当莫得劳克太太打开门，他听到笑声和絮絮闲聊。柯林在沙发上，身着休息长袍，相当直地坐起来，看着花园书之一里面的一幅画，对那个乏味的孩子说着话，那一刻那个孩子很难说是乏味，因为她的脸快乐得光彩照人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy," Dr. Craven said a trifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy should chance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting Misselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克兰文医生感到相当警觉。假如这个疲倦的、歇斯底里的孩子有可能好起来，他自己就毫无可能继承米瑟韦斯特庄园了；但是他不是个无道德的人，虽然他软弱，他不想让他陷入真正的危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That sounds soothing," said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and glancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking down silently at the carpet. "You are evidently better, but you must remember --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't want to remember," interrupted the Rajah, appearing again. "When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and I think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so. If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill instead of remembering it I would have him brought here." And he waved a thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet rings made of rubies. "It is because my cousin makes me forget that she makes me better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想记住，”话被打断，王爷重现，“当我一个人躺着，记起来，我开始到处疼，我想的事情让我开始尖叫，因为我非常憎恨他们。要是哪里有个医生能让你忘记自己的病，而不是记住它，我会派人带他来。”他挥挥瘦弱的手，那手上真的应该盖满标有皇室徽记的红宝石戒指。“我表妹能让我好些，正是因为她能让我忘记。”">查看中文翻译</div>

When he went downstairs he looked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the library she felt that he was a much puzzled man.</div>

But don't you -- none o' you -- think as you own th' whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an you won't find it out without hard knocks." What children learns from children,' she says, 'is that there's no sense in grabbin' at th' whole orange -- peel an' all.

<div class="line_en">That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened his eyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it -- smiled because he felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to be awake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He felt as if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let him go. He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerves had relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at the wall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans he and Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon and his wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to think about. And he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet running along the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute she was in the room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a waft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那晚上柯林睡梦中一次都没有醒过，当他早晨睁开眼睛，他静静地躺着，不自知地微笑起来，因为他觉得一种奇妙的舒服。醒来竟然成为美好的，他转身，奢侈地伸张四肢。他觉得捆住他的紧绷的绳子仿佛自己松开了，任由他去。他不知道克兰文医生本来应该说他的神经放松了，得当了休息。他不再躺着瞪着墙祈望自己不是清醒的，现在他的脑子里充满了他和玛丽昨天制定的计划，充满了花园的图画，充满了迪肯和他的野生动物。有事情可考虑真是好。当他听到走廊上一路跑来的脚步声，刚刚醒来不到十分钟，玛丽站在门口。一眨眼她就到房间里了，穿过房间跑到他的床边，带来一股充满清晨气息的新鲜空气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found three days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor. It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to do with it. He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk. It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body Dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak. A lamb -- a lamb! A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!</div>
