<div class="line_en">The boy had many more luxuries and comforts than had been given to his father. Mr Osborne's wealth had increased greatly in recent years, and he had ambitious plans for his grandson, who was sent to an expensive little school, and who wore the finest clothes any young gentleman was ever seen in -- even his shirts had little jewelled buttons. The neat, plain shirts that his mother had sewn for him with such loving care were never worn -- Miss Osborne gave them to the coachman's boy.</div>

His grandfather had had a painting of the boy done by a famous artist, and Georgy asked the artist to make a little copy of the painting. It made Amelia so happy, this little picture. She wept and laughed over it, slept with it under her pillow, and kissed it a hundred times a day.</div>

He travelled night and day across country to the port, where he was struck down by a fever that nearly killed him.

<div class="line_en">The Major held her gently, kissing her head as if she was a child. "I will not change, dear Amelia," he said. "I ask for no more than your love. Only let me stay near you and see you often."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少校轻轻地搂着她，像对待孩子一样亲了亲她的头。“我的心意不会改变，亲爱的阿梅莉亚。”他说，“除了你的爱我别无所求。就让我待在你的身边，经常见见你吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, often," Amelia said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，经常。”阿梅莉亚说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Life was now much more comfortable for Amelia, but there were more changes ahead. In the winter Mr Sedley died, cared for devotedly by Amelia in his last illness, and less than a year later, Mr Osborne was found dead in his bedroom one morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿梅莉亚现在的生活舒适多了，但是后来发生了更多变故。冬天的时候塞德利先生去世了。他患病临终前，阿梅莉亚尽心尽力照顾他。不到一年后的一天早晨，奥斯本先生也死在了他的卧室里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And that was all Dobbin had -- permission to be near her and to see her, and nothing more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多宾获得的就是这些——被允许待在她近旁，能见她，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man had softened in his last year and, under Dobbin's influence, his anger and hate had faded away. He had left half his fortune to Georgy, and half to his two daughters. But there was also a pension of five hundred pounds a year for Amelia. And he wished his grandson to return to the care of his mother, the widow of his much loved son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在生命的最后一年里，老奥斯本的态度软化了，而且在多宾的影响下，他的愤怒与仇恨也逐渐淡去。他把一半财产留给乔基，一半留给他的两个女儿。而且还给阿梅莉亚留了每年五百英镑的年金。他希望孙子重新由母亲——他爱子的遗孀照看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Amelia was overjoyed, and when she learnt it was Dobbin who had caused the change of heart in the old man, she was deeply grateful to him -- deeply grateful, but no more. If she thought of anything else, a picture of George rose before her eyes and said, "You are mine, and mine only, now and for ever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿梅莉亚喜不自胜。当她听说是多宾劝服老人改变了心意，她对他充满感激之情。但除此之外，再无其他。如果她有其他想法，乔治的头像就会浮现在她面前说：“你属于我，只属于我，从现在直到永远。”">查看中文翻译</div>
