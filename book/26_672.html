<div class="line_en">Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed the passage and listened a minute at Miles's door. What, under my endless obsession, I had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at rest, and I presently caught one, but not in the form I had expected. His voice tinkled out.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我用了很长时间想如何落笔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The weather had changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room, with Flora at peace beside me, I sat for a long time before a blank sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of the gusts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气变得又跟往常一样，屋外刮着大风。在我房间的灯下，弗洛拉在我旁边静静地睡着。我对着这张白纸坐了很久，倾听着大雨的拍打声和狂风的呼啸声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You're like a troop of cavalry!" he beautifully laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我当然是听到你了。你幻想着没有弄出声响来吗？你就像是一队骑兵！”他可爱地笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I say, you there -- come in." It was a gaiety in the gloom! I went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his ease. "Well, what are YOU up to?" he asked with a grace of sociability in which it occurred to me that Mrs. Grose, had she been present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was "out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，你在那里——进来吧。”这个声音让人又喜又忧！我拿着蜡烛走了进去，发现他躺在床上，非常清醒又特别自在。“咦，你在做什么呢？”他的言语间透出一种善于交际的魅力，这使我想到，如果格罗斯太太在场的话，她可能就不会找到任何外在的证据。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把我的蜡烛特意往远处放了放，当他向我伸出他那友好的、熟悉的手时，我就坐到了他的床边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你所说的其他的一切是指什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could say nothing for a minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at that moment so fabulous as our actual relation. "Certainly you shall go back to school," I said, "if it be that that troubles you. But not to the old place -- we must find another, a better. How could I know it did trouble you, this question, when you never told me so, never spoke of it at all?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一时间说不出话来。我握着他的手，我们继续看着对方，尽管我感觉我的沉默像是默认了他对我的指责。在这个现实世界里，或许没有什么比我们此刻真实的关系更让人难以置信了。“你当然会回到学校，”我说，“如果就是那个让你烦恼的话。但不是回以前的地方——我们必须找另外一所学校，一所更好的。你从来没有告诉过我，从来没有提起过，我怎么知道这个问题让你烦恼呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, the pride I take in your appreciation doesn't insist on that! I had so far rather you slept."</div>

<div class="line_en">I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一时间简直屏住了呼吸，烛光微弱，但光亮足以让我看清他头枕枕头向我微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His clear, listening face, framed in its smooth whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful patient in a children's hospital; and I would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might help! "Do you know you've never said a word to me about your school -- I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any way?" He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他倾听着，小脸干净、光滑而苍白，这让他在那一刻就像儿童医院里一个充满渴望的小病号一样惹人怜惜。想到这个相似之处，我愿意付出我的所有，变成一个护士或慈善人士去帮助他治愈。啊，即便是这样，我或许可以帮上忙！“你知道吗？你从来没有跟我说过关于你学校的一个字——我指的是你以前的学校，你从来没以任何方式提起过它。”他好像有点儿好奇，脸上仍那样可爱地微笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he clearly gained time; he waited, he called for guidance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他明显在争取时间。他等待着，他需要引导。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Haven't I?" It wasn't for ME to help him -- it was for the thing I had met! Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known; so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence and consistency.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有提起过吗？”并不是我去帮他——只是我所遇到的这事本身来帮助他！当我读出他的语气以及他脸上的表情所包含的东西时，我的心一阵剧痛，这种痛前所未有。他的小脑袋一片迷茫，只知道玩耍，看到他在诅咒下，那么天真、始终如一，让人有一种无以言表的感动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, never -- from the hour you came back. You've never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your comrades, nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at school. Never, little Miles -- no, never -- have you given me an inkling of anything that MAY have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how much I'm in the dark. Until you came out, that way, this morning, you had, since the first hour I saw you, scarce even made a reference to anything in your previous life. You seemed so perfectly to accept the present." It was extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret precocity (or whatever I might call the poison of an influence that I dared but half to phrase) made him, in spite of the faint breath of his inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person -- imposed him almost as an intellectual equal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，从来没有——从你回来的那一刻开始。你从未向我提起过你的任何一位老师、一个同伴，或者哪怕是你在学校里发生的鸡毛蒜皮的事情。从来没有，小迈尔斯——是的，从来没向我暗示过你在那里发生的任何事情。所以，你可以想象我是毫不知情的。直到今天早上你才说出来，之前，从我第一次见到你时，你几乎从没有提起过你以前生活的任何事情。你好像很乐意接受现在的生活。”超乎寻常的是，我对他不为人知的早熟非常确定（或许可以称其为我敢于描述、却难以描述的一种影响的毒害），尽管他内心的忧虑让他呼吸微弱，却让他看起来更像一个大于实际年龄的人——使他几乎与之智力相当。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉自己并不像迈尔斯一样了解，我暂时回避了这个话题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让我吃惊的是，听到这话，他有点儿脸红。至少，他像一个有点儿疲惫的康复者，没精打采地摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“而你，迈尔斯，将不得不告诉他多少呢？他会问你一些事情的！”他仔细考虑了一会儿：“很有可能。不过是什么事情呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他讲出这句话时带着的那种得意，帮助我在那一瞬间对他有了更多的认识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I don't want to go back!" he broke in. "I want a new field." he said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable gaiety; and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reappearance at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more dishonor. It overwhelmed me now that I should never be able to bear that, and it made me let myself go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，我不想回去！”他打断我说，“我想要一片新天地。”他说这话时带着一种令人钦佩的平静和一种充满希望的、不容置疑的欢乐。毫无疑问，正是这一点，把他的辛酸，他不自然的孩子气的悲剧唤回到我面前，还有他这三个月来的虚张声势和更多的不良行为。这让此时的我不知所措，让我无法忍受，于是我释放了自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I threw myself upon him and in the tenderness of my pity I embraced him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我扑到他身上，带着一种怜爱的温柔抱着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that I caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting consciousness -- it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize once more the chance of possessing him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dear little Miles, dear little Miles, if you KNEW how I want to help you! It's only that, it's nothing but that, and I'd rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrong -- I'd rather die than hurt a hair of you. Dear little Miles -- oh, I brought it out now even if I SHOULD go too far -- I just want you to help me to save you!" But I knew in a moment after this that I had gone too far.
