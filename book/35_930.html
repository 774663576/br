<div class="line_en">It took some time to negotiate the muddy slope down to the boathouse, and when they stepped under its low arch, the near-darkness and the proximity of the lapping water seemed only to make Beatrice shiver more. They moved further inside, over damp wooden boards, and saw beyond the roof's overhang tall grass, rushes, and an expanse of the river. Then a man's figure rose from the shadows to their left, saying: "Who might you be, friends?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He longed for a patch of sun to warm Beatrice. But though the opposite bank was often bathed in morning light, their side of the river remained shaded and cold. Axl could feel her leaning on him as they walked, and her shivering had grown steadily worse. He had been about to suggest another rest when at last they spotted the roof behind the willows, jutting out into the water.</div>

I can at least promise you safe passage for any cargo you'd entrust should you allow us to use it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="船夫在喊他们，他们小心翼翼踩着几块小石头走下去，两只筐子在水中一上一下，船夫用一根长竿把筐子稳住。“里面铺好了兽皮，”他说，“你们几乎感觉不到河上的冷气。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boatkeeper too was looking at Beatrice, who had now curled up on her side and closed her eyes. Suddenly he removed one of the furs he was wearing, and bending forward, laid it on top of her. She seemed not to notice -- her eyes remained closed -- so it was Axl who thanked him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船夫也在看着比特丽丝，她侧身蜷缩着，闭上了眼睛。突然，船夫脱下身上的一件兽皮衣服，弯下腰，把衣服盖在她身上。她似乎没有注意——眼睛仍然是闭的——于是埃克索代妻子向他表示感谢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Welcome, friend. Leave everything at the lower boathouse for me." The man pushed them into the tide with his pole. "Sit low and keep the staff handy for the weeds."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was bitingly cold on the river. Broken ice drifted here and there in sheets, but their baskets moved past them with ease, sometimes bumping gently one against the other. The baskets were shaped almost like boats, with a bow and stern, but had a tendency to rotate, so that at times Axl found himself gazing back up the river to the boathouse still visible on the bank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河面上冷得刺骨。破碎的冰块东一片西一片，不过他们的两个筐子能轻松通过，有时候还会轻轻碰一下。筐子的外形和船差不多，有船头船尾，不过容易打转，所以有时候埃克索一抬眼，又能望到上游岸边的船屋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dawn was pouring through the waving grass beside them, and as the boatkeeper had promised, the river moved at an easy pace. Even so, Axl found himself glancing continuously over at Beatrice's basket, which appeared to be filled entirely by the animal skin, with only a small portion of her hair visible to betray her presence. Once he called out: "We'll be there in no time, princess," and when there was no response, reached over to tug her basket closer.</div>

It was long ago and I had tight around me that cloak of badger hides you made once as a tender gift to me. I was standing like that, and in our former chamber too, not the one we have now, for the wall had branches of beech crossing left to right, and I was watching a caterpillar crawling slowly along it, and asking why a caterpillar wouldn't be asleep so late at night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道这是做梦还是回忆。可我刚才看到，我自己深夜站在我们的屋子里。那是很久以前，我身上紧紧裹着那件獾皮斗篷，是你好心做的，送给我当礼物。我就那样站着，还在我们以前住的屋子，不是现在那间，因为墙上从左到右编着山毛榉枝条，我看着一只毛毛虫沿着墙慢慢爬，心里想，夜这么深了，这只毛毛虫为什么不睡觉呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The baskets were moving ever more slowly now, pulling inwards towards the sludge-like water where the bank made its turn. Thrusting the staff into the water, Axl found he could touch the bottom easily, but when he tried to push off back into the tide, the river floor sucked at the stick, allowing him no purchase. He could see too, in the morning light breaking over the long-grassed fields, how weeds had woven thickly around both baskets, as though to bind them further to this stagnant spot. The boat was almost before them, and as they drifted lethargically towards it, Axl held out the staff to touch against its stern and brought them to a halt.</div>

The unusual nature of her garment -- a patchwork of numerous small dark rags -- and the sooty grime smeared over her face had momentarily deceived him. Moreover, she was seated in a peculiar posture, her head tilted heavily to one side, so that it was almost touching the boat's floor.

There was cargo piled near the stern, but Axl paid this little attention, for the woman was saying something again.

<div class="line_en">He stepped towards the stern, a hand raised against the low sun, and gazed down at the objects piled in the shadows. He could make out tangled nets, a soaked-through blanket left in a heap, a long-handled tool, like a hoe, lying across it. And there was a wooden, lidless box -- the sort fishermen used to keep fresh the dying fish they had caught. But when he peered into it, he saw not fish but skinned rabbits -- a considerable number of them, pressed so closely one against the other their tiny limbs appeared to be locked together. Then, as he watched, the whole mass of sinews, elbows and ankles began to shift. Axl took a step back even as he saw an eye open, and then another. A sound made him turn, and he saw at the other end of the boat, still bathed in orange light, the old woman slumped against the bow with pixies -- too many to count -- swarming over her. At first glance she looked contented, as if being smothered in affection, while the small, scrawny creatures ran through her rags and over her face and shoulders. And now there came more and more out of the river, climbing over the rim of the boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他举起一只手遮着太阳，迈步朝船尾走去，眼睛盯着黑暗中那一堆东西。缠在一起的网，一条堆成一团的水淋淋的毯子，一件类似于锄头的长柄工具横放在湿毯子上。还有一个没有盖子的木箱——渔夫用这种箱子来装抓到的鱼，以保持新鲜。他朝里面一看，却发现箱子里装的不是鱼，而是剥了皮的兔子，数量不少，密密匝匝堆着，细小的腿好像都缠在一起一样。就在他看着的时候，那一大堆肌肉、手肘、脚踝突然动了起来。埃克索往后退了一步，同时看到一只眼睛睁开了，接着又一只也睁开了。后面有声响，他转过身去，船的另一边仍然沐浴在橘色光亮之中，老太太缩在船头，浑身上下爬满了小妖精，多得数不清。初看之下，她似乎颇为享受，那些又瘦又小的家伙在她的破衣服里、脸上、肩膀上跑来跑去，好像都急着表达对她的喜爱。这时候越来越多的小精灵从河里冒出来，纷纷往船上爬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl reached down for the long-handled tool before him, but he too had become enveloped by a sense of tranquillity, and he found himself extracting the pole from the tangled netting in a strangely leisurely manner. He knew more and more creatures were rising from the water -- how many might have boarded now? Thirty? Sixty?-- and their collective voices seemed to him to resemble the sound of children playing in the distance. He had the presence of mind to raise the long tool -- a hoe, surely, for was that not a rusted blade on the end rising into the sky, or yet another creature clinging to it?-- and bring it crashing down onto the tiny knuckles and knees mounting the side of the boat. Then a second swing, this time towards the box with the skinned rabbits from which more pixies were running out. But then he had never been much of a swordsman, his skill being for diplomacy and, when required, intrigue, though who could claim he had ever betrayed the trust his skills had won? On the contrary, it was he who had been betrayed, but he could still wield a weapon in some fashion, and now he would bring it down this way and that, for had he not to defend Beatrice from these swarming creatures? But here they came, more and more -- were they still coming from that box, or from the shallow waters? Were they even now gathering around Beatrice asleep in her basket? The last blow of the hoe had had some effect, for several creatures had fallen back into the water, and then another blow had sent two, even three, flying through the air, and the old woman was a stranger, what obligation did he have to her before his own wife? But there she was, the strange woman, hardly visible now beneath the writhing creatures, and Axl crossed the length of the boat, hoe raised, and made another arc in the air to sweep off as many as possible without injury to the stranger. Yet how they clung on! And now they even dared to speak to him -- or was that the old woman herself from beneath them?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索弯腰去拿那件长柄工具，但他也被一种静谧感包裹住了，发现自己从乱糟糟的渔网中抽出工具时，悠闲自在得出奇。他知道越来越多的精灵从水里冒出来——多少已经上船了呢？三十？四十？——它们的声音合在一起，在他听来，好像是孩子们在远处玩耍。他并非完全心不在焉，还知道把那个长柄工具举起来——是把锄头，肯定没错，朝上的那一端不是有上了锈的刃口吗？抑或是又一个精灵趴在上面？——然后挥下来，砸在正朝船边上爬的那些小手指、小膝盖上。接着，又挥了第二下，这次砸向有剥皮兔子的那只箱子，更多精灵正从里面往外跑。不过，他一直算不得什么剑客，他所擅长的是外交，如果有必要的话，还有阴谋。但是，外交为他赢来的信任，他又何曾背叛过？恰恰相反，是他自己被人背叛了，可他总还能挥动两下武器吧，现在他就要挥起锄头，东打西砸——他不是该保护比特丽丝，不让这群东西侵犯她吗？可是它们不停地拥过来，越来越多——还是从那个箱子里出来的吗？或者是从浅水里爬上来的？现在它们是不是已经围住了在筐子里睡觉的比特丽丝？锄头最后那一下子起了点效果，有几只掉进了水里，接着又是一下子，有两只甚至三只飞了出去，那位老太太只是个陌生人，与自己妻子相比，他对她能有什么义务呢？但她就在那儿，这个陌生女人，被一堆蠕动的精灵覆盖着，几乎看不见。埃克索走到船的另一头，举起锄头，在空中抡了一圈，在不伤害陌生人的情况下，尽可能扫开一些。可它们却不肯轻易放手！现在呢，它们竟然胆敢对他说话了——抑或说话的是被它们覆盖着的老太太本人？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Leave her to us, stranger," the old woman said again, and only this time did it occur to him, with a stab of fear that seemed bottomless, that the speaker was talking not of the dying stranger before him but of Beatrice. And turning to his wife's basket in the reeds, he saw the waters around it alive with limbs and shoulders. His own basket was nearly capsizing from the pull of the creatures trying to climb in, preserved only by the ballast of those already inside. But they were boarding his basket only to gain access to its neighbour. He could see other creatures massing over the animal skin covering Beatrice, and uttering a cry, he climbed the side of the boat and let himself fall into the water. It was deeper than he had anticipated, coming above his waist, but the shock of it took his breath only for an instant, before he let out a warrior's bellow that came to him as if from a distant memory, and he lurched towards the baskets, the hoe held high above him. There was tugging at his clothes, and the water felt honey-like, but when he brought the hoe down onto his own basket, even though his weapon travelled with frustrating slowness through the air, once it landed more creatures than he could have suspected tumbled out into the water. The next swing caused even greater destruction -- he must this time have swung with the blade outwards, for was that not bloodied flesh he saw flying up into the sunlight? And yet Beatrice remained an age away, floating complacently even as the creatures rose about her, and now they came from the land too, pouring through the grass on the riverbank. Creatures were now even hanging from his hoe and he let it fall into the water, suddenly wishing only to be at Beatrice's side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把她交给我们，陌生人，”老太太又说道。这次埃克索突然想到，说话的人指的不是生命垂危的陌生人，而是比特丽丝。恐惧感扎进他心里，像深不见底的洞，他转头去看芦苇丛中妻子乘坐的那只筐子，发现筐子周围的水中纷纷扰扰，尽是手臂和肩膀。同时，一大群精灵从一侧往他自己乘坐的筐子上爬，差点把筐子掀翻，幸好筐子里已经有很多精灵，起到了压舱的作用。但是，它们爬上来，只是为了由此进入旁边的筐子。埃克索看见其他精灵正聚集到比特丽丝盖的兽皮上，他喊了一声，从船舷爬出去，落在水里。水比他想象的更深，直到腰部，但他只是打了个冷颤，便立即发出一声武士的吼叫，那声音似乎来自遥远的记忆。他把锄头高高举在头顶，摇摇晃晃朝筐子走去。精灵在拉他的衣服，而且水感觉像蜜一样稠，他一锄头砸在自己的筐子上，武器在空中划过的速度慢得让人心急，但一旦落下，精灵纷纷落水，比他想象的还多。接下来的一锄头，产生了更大的破坏——这次锄头的刃口肯定是朝外的，那被他砸飞到阳光之中的，难道不是带血的肉吗？然而，比特丽丝仍然遥不可及。她怡然自得地在水上漂着，精灵在她周围越积越多，有的来自陆地，从河岸的草丛中拥出来。有些甚至黏附在他的锄头上，他手一松，让锄头落在水里。突然之间，他只希望能赶到比特丽丝身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
