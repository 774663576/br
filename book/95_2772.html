<div class="line_en">In a black neighborhood, you wouldn't dare own a cat, especially a black cat. That would be like wearing a sign that said, "Hello, I am a witch." That would be suicide. Since we'd moved to a colored neighborhood, my mom thought the cats would be okay. Once they were grown we let them out during the day to roam the neighborhood. Then we came home one evening and found the cats strung up by their tails from our front gate, gutted and skinned and bleeding out, their heads chopped off. On our front wall someone had written in Afrikaans, "Heks"--"Witch."</div>

<div class="line_en">A month after we moved to Eden Park, my mother brought home two cats. Black cats. Beautiful creatures. Some woman from her work had a litter of kittens she was trying to get rid of, and my mom ended up with two. I was excited because I'd never had a pet before. My mom was excited because she loves animals. She didn't believe in any nonsense about cats. It was just another way in which she was a rebel, refusing to conform to ideas about what black people did and didn't do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在搬去伊登公园一个月后，妈妈带回家两只猫。黑猫。极美的生物。她的同事有一窝小猫要送掉，她要了两只。我特别兴奋，因为我从来没有养过宠物。我妈妈也很兴奋，她特别喜欢动物，完全不信那些关于猫的瞎话。这也是她叛逆的一个方面——她从来不会因为大家觉得黑人该做什么或不该做什么而跟风。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the cats were killed, we took a break from pets for a while. Then we got dogs. Dogs are cool. Almost every black family I knew had a dog. No matter how poor you were, you had a dog. White people treat dogs like children or members of the family. Black people's dogs are more for protection, a poor-man's alarm system. You buy a dog and you keep it out in the yard. Black people name dogs by their traits. If it has stripes, you call it Tiger. If it's vicious, you call it Danger. If it has spots, you call it Spotty. Given the finite number of traits a dog can have, pretty much everyone's dogs have the same names; people just recycle them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫死了之后，我们有一段时间没有养宠物。然后我们开始养狗。狗很棒。我认识的每一个黑人家庭都养狗。不管你多穷，你都有只狗。只不过我们对待狗的方式和白人不一样。白人对待狗，就好像狗是他们的小孩或家庭成员。黑人的狗通常就是看家护院，是穷人的警报系统。你买回一只狗，只能把它放在院子里。黑人根据狗的特点给狗起名。如果身上有条纹，就叫它老虎。如果很凶，就叫它危险。如果有斑点，就叫点点。由于狗身上的特征有限，所以很多人家的狗名字都一样。人们就反复利用这些名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't exactly devastated about the cats. I don't think we'd had them long enough for me to get attached; I don't even remember their names. And cats are dicks for the most part. As much as I tried they never felt like real pets. They never showed me affection nor did they accept any of mine. Had the cats made more of an effort, I might have felt like I had lost something. But even as a kid, looking at these dead, mutilated animals, I was like, "Well, there you have it. Maybe if they'd been nicer, they could have avoided this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我并没有特别伤心。我觉得我和那两只猫相处的时间不够长，还没有产生很深的感情。我甚至不记得它们的名字了。而且猫大多数时候挺混蛋的。我再怎么努力，它们也不像真正的宠物。它们不会向我表达感情，也不接受我的感情。要是猫能和我更亲密一些，可能我当时会更难过。但是，作为小孩，我看着这些死去的动物残肢，我想的是：“好吧，就这样了。如果它们能乖一点儿，可能就不会发生这样的事了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Panther, who was more half-and-half, came out weird and scruffy-looking. Panther was smart. Fufi was dumb as shit. At least we always thought she was dumb as shit. Whenever we called them, Panther would come right away, but Fufi wouldn't do anything. Panther would run back and get Fufi and then they'd both come. It turned out that Fufi was deaf. Years later Fufi died when a burglar was trying to break into our house. He pushed the gate over and it fell on her back and broke her spine. We took her to the vet and she had to be put down. After examining her, the vet came over and gave us the news.</div>

It was a strange, gruesome relationship.</div>

I have so many friends who still, as adults, wrestle with feelings of betrayal. They'll come to me angry and crying and talking about how they've been cheated on and lied to, and I feel for them. I understand what they're going through. I sit with them and buy them a drink and I say, "Friend, let me tell you the story of Fufi."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我相信芙菲是我的狗，当然这并不是真的。芙菲是只狗。我是个小孩。我们在一起玩得很开心。只是恰巧她住在我们家而已。这段经历影响了日后我对于感情的看法：你并不拥有你所爱的人。我很幸运，可以在那么小的年纪就学到这个道理。我有很多朋友，在成年以后，依然会因为被人背叛而悲痛欲绝。他们会找到我，胸中充满愤怒，向我哭诉自己是如何被人背叛，被欺骗，而我完全可以感同身受。我理解他们所遭遇的这一切。我会和他们坐下来，点杯喝的，对他们说：“朋友，我来给你讲一个芙菲的故事吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fufi was my first heartbreak. No one has ever betrayed me more than Fufi. It was a valuable lesson to me. The hard thing was understanding that Fufi wasn't cheating on me with another boy. She was merely living her life to the fullest. Until I knew that she was going out on her own during the day, her other relationship hadn't affected me at all. Fufi had no malicious intent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我人生中第一次那么伤心就是因为芙菲。没人像芙菲那样背叛过我。这对我来说是非常宝贵的一课。难的是，我需要明白芙菲并没有背叛我去和别人在一起。她只是在尽情地过她的生活。在我知道她白天会偷偷溜出去玩之前，她和另一家人的关系并没有影响到她和我之间的感情。芙菲并没有恶意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's not about knowing who you are. It's about him knowing who you are, and you knowing who he is. Too many men grow up without their fathers, so they spend their lives with a false impression of who their father is and what a father should be. You need to find your father. You need to show him what you've become. You need to finish that story."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不是你知不知道你是谁的事，而是他知不知道你是谁，你又知不知道他是谁。太多人长大了却不认识自己的父亲，所以他们一辈子都带着对父亲的虚假认知，以为那就是父亲该有的样子。你需要找到你的父亲。你要告诉他你变成了怎样的人。你需要把这段故事补完。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why?" I asked. At that point I hadn't seen him in over ten years and didn't think I'd ever see him again.</div>
