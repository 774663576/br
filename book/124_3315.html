<div class="line_en">When we first got there, I sat in the back of the visitation room, a little room of exposed stone walls off to the side of the sanctuary in the Literal Heart of Jesus church. There were maybe eighty chairs set up in the room, and it was two-thirds full but felt one-third empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a while, I just watched people walk up to the coffin, which was on some kind of cart covered in a purple tablecloth. All these people I'd never seen before would kneel down next to him or stand over him and look at him for a while, maybe crying, maybe saying something, and then all of them would touch the coffin instead of touching him, because no one wants to touch the dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gus's mom and dad were standing next to the coffin, hugging everybody as they passed by, but when they noticed me, they smiled and shuffled over. I got up and hugged first his dad and then his mom, who held on to me too tight, like Gus used to, squeezing my shoulder blades. They both looked so old -- their eye sockets hollowed, the skin sagging from their exhausted faces. They had reached the end of a hurdling sprint, too.</div>

I could see him as I approached: His hair was parted neatly on the left side in a way that he would have found absolutely horrifying, and his face was plasticized. But he was still Gus. My lanky, beautiful Gus.</div>

I pulled the oxygen tube from my nostrils and raised the tube up over my head, handing it to Dad. I wanted it to be just me and just him. I grabbed my little clutch and walked up the makeshift aisle between the rows of chairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought we'd go into the proper sanctuary for the real funeral, but it all happened in that little side room -- the Literal Hand of Jesus, I guess, the part of the cross he'd been nailed to. A minister walked up and stood behind the coffin, almost like the coffin was a pulpit or something, and talked a little bit about how Augustus had a courageous battle and how his heroism in the face of illness was an inspiration to us all, and I was already starting to get pissed off at the minister when he said, "In heaven, Augustus will finally be healed and whole," implying that he had been less whole than other people due to his leglessness, and I kind of could not repress my sigh of disgust. My dad grabbed me just above the knee and cut me a disapproving look, but from the row behind me, someone muttered almost inaudibly near my ear, "What a load of horse crap, eh, kid?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我原以为葬礼正式开始的时候会去主圣坛，没想到葬礼全程都在那间小小的侧屋举行——我猜，这里可以叫作“实实在在的耶稣之手”，也就是耶稣被钉到十字架上的部分。一位牧师走上前去，站在棺材后面，简直好像棺材是个布道坛什么的，他略谈了几句奥古斯塔斯与病魔的顽强战斗，还有他面对疾病的英雄气概对我们所有人来说都是个鼓舞什么的。我已经开始烦这个牧师了，而他继续说：“在天堂里，奥古斯塔斯终将重新成为一个健康、齐全的孩子。”言下之意无非是，他活着的时候，因为失去了一条腿，就没有别人那么齐全了。我简直就要克制不住地发出一声反感的叹息，爸爸抓住了我的膝头，很不赞成地瞟了我一眼，而身后的一排座位上，有个人用微不可闻的声音在我耳边轻声嘟哝道：“好一堆长篇大论的废话，是吧，孩子？”">查看中文翻译</div>

He looked like he was dressed for a colonial occupation of Panama, not a funeral.

After a moment, he whispered, "We gotta fake pray," and bowed his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得·范·豪滕穿着一件白色亚麻西装，剪裁得恰到好处地衬托出他圆滚滚的轮廓，里面是浅灰蓝色的正装衬衫，打着绿领带。他这副打扮看起来活像要去殖民占领巴拿马，而不是参加葬礼。牧师说：“让我们祈祷吧。”所有人都低下了头，而我只能瞪着从天而降的彼得·范·豪滕，下巴都要惊掉了。片刻之后，他悄声说：“我们得假装祈祷啊。”然后低下头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The minister called up Isaac, who was much more serious than he'd been at the prefuneral. "Augustus Waters was the Mayor of the Secret City of Cancervania, and he is not replaceable," Isaac began. "Other people will be able to tell you funny stories about Gus, because he was a funny guy, but let me tell you a serious one: A day after I got my eye cut out, Gus showed up at the hospital. I was blind and heartbroken and didn't want to do anything and Gus burst into my room and shouted, 'I have wonderful news!' And I was like, 'I don't really want to hear wonderful news right now,' and Gus said, 'This is wonderful news you want to hear,' and I asked him, 'Fine, what is it?' and he said, 'You are going to live a good and long life filled with great and terrible moments that you cannot even imagine yet!'"</div>

<div class="line_en">After a high school friend told some stories about Gus's considerable basketball talents and his many qualities as a teammate, the minister said, "We'll now hear a few words from Augustus's special friend, Hazel." Special friend? There were some titters in the audience, so I figured it was safe for me to start out by saying to the minister, "I was his girlfriend." That got a laugh. Then I began reading from the eulogy I'd written.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来，一位高中好友向我们讲述了格斯惊人的篮球天赋以及作为队友的诸多好品质，然后，牧师说：“现在，我们要请奥古斯塔斯一位特别的朋友——海蓁讲几句话。”特别的朋友？听众中发出几声窃窃私语，于是我估计以这样的话做开场白会比较保险——我对牧师说：“我是他的女朋友。”这句话引来一片笑声。然后我开始念事先写好的悼词。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After his sister Julie spoke, the service ended with a prayer about Gus's union with God, and I thought back to what he'd told me at Oranjee, that he didn't believe in mansions and harps, but did believe in capital-S Something, and so I tried to imagine him capital-S Somewhere as we prayed, but even then I could not quite convince myself that he and I would be together again. I already knew too many dead people. I knew that time would now pass for me differently than it would for him -- that I, like everyone in that room, would go on accumulating loves and losses while he would not. And for me, that was the final and truly unbearable tragedy: Like all the innumerable dead, he'd once and for all been demoted from haunted to haunter.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your boy Waters and I corresponded a bit, and in his last --"</div>

<div class="line_en">We reached the bottom of the hill. "Okay, yeah," I said. I was in no mood for this. Peter Van Houten would not hijack Gus's funeral. I wouldn't allow it. "Thanks," I said. "Well, I guess we're at the bottom of the hill."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们已经到了小山脚下。“好吧，没错。”我说，我没心情纠缠这些。彼得·范·豪滕别想劫持格斯的葬礼，我决不允许。“谢谢，”我说，“嗯，我看我们已经到山脚了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Omnis cellula e cellula," he said again. "All cells come from cells. Every cell is born of a previous cell, which was born of a previous cell. Life comes from life. Life begets life begets life begets life begets life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“Omnis cellula e cellula。 ”他重复一遍。“所有的细胞都来自细胞。每个细胞都是由此前存在的细胞产生，那个细胞又是由再早些的细胞产生。生命来自生命；生命产生生命。轮回不止，生生不息。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait, you read your fan mail now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等，你现在看粉丝来信了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," I said. "I'm good. I think you're a pathetic alcoholic who says fancy things to get attention like a really precocious eleven-year-old and I feel super bad for you. But yeah, no, you're not the guy who wrote An Imperial Affliction anymore, so you couldn't sequel it even if you wanted to. Thanks, though. Have an excellent life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不想，”我说，“我没事了。我觉得你是个可怜的酒鬼，像个老气横秋的十一岁小孩一样故弄玄虚来吸引别人注意，我超级替你难过。不过没错，我不想要解释，你已经不是写出《无比美妙的痛苦》的那家伙了，所以你也没法续写，就算你想写也写不出。不过还是谢谢了，祝你生活愉快。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, he sent it to my house, not through my publisher. And I'd hardly call him a fan. He despised me. But at any rate he was quite insistent that I'd be absolved for my misbehavior if I attended his funeral and told you what became of Anna's mother. So here I am, and there's your answer: Omnis cellula e cellula."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是，他把信寄到我家门口了，不是通过出版社转交的。而且我觉得他基本不能叫作粉丝。他厌恶我。不过，无论如何，他相当坚决，一再要求如果我参加他的葬礼，告诉你安娜的妈妈后来怎么样了，他就原谅我的失礼举止。所以我来了。而这就是给你的答案：Omnis cellula e cellula。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" I asked again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”我又问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't want an explanation?" he asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">We finally got home around six, and I was exhausted. I just wanted to sleep, but Mom made me eat some cheesy pasta, although she at least allowed me to eat in bed. I slept with the BiPAP for a couple hours. Waking up was horrible, because for a disoriented moment I felt like everything was fine, and then it crushed me anew. Mom took me off the BiPAP, I tethered myself to a portable tank, and stumbled into my bathroom to brush my teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六点左右，我们终于回到了家。我精疲力竭，只想睡觉，但妈妈非逼着我吃了些奶酪意面，不过至少她同意我在床上吃。我戴着呼吸机的面罩睡了几个小时。醒来的感觉极糟，因为刚醒来昏头转向的一刻，我恍惚以为一切都好，随后我清醒过来，再次崩溃。妈妈把我从呼吸机上取下来，我把自己拴到便携氧气瓶上，然后跌跌撞撞去卫生间刷牙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks for the booze," I said. "Now get out of the car." He looked scolded. Dad had stopped the car and we just idled there below Gus's grave for a minute until Van Houten opened the door and, finally silent, left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你的酒，”我说，“现在请你下车。”他看起来一副挨了责骂的样子。爸爸已经停了车，我们让引擎空转着等在格斯坟墓所在的山脚下，一分钟之后，范·豪滕打开车门，终于沉默地离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Appraising myself in the mirror as I brushed my teeth, I kept thinking there were two kinds of adults: There were Peter Van Houtens -- miserable creatures who scoured the earth in search of something to hurt. And then there were people like my parents, who walked around zombically, doing whatever they had to do to keep walking around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一边刷牙一边打量着镜子里的自己，脑子里一直在想，世上有两种大人：一种是彼得·范·豪滕那样的——可恶可鄙的可怜虫，掘地三尺地寻找可以伤害的对象；另一种人则像我爸妈，麻木不仁地行走四方，并为了能继续走下去，做一切需要做的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we drove away, I watched through the back window as he took a drink and raised the bottle in my direction, as if toasting me. His eyes looked so sad. I felt kinda bad for him, to be honest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们开车离开的时候，我透过后窗看到他喝了一杯，朝我的方向举起酒瓶，好像在向我敬酒。他的眼睛看起来很悲伤。老实说，我对他有点不好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone knocked on the bathroom door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人敲敲浴室门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Occupada," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有人啦。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Gives you an idea how I feel about you," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可以让你明白我对你是什么感受。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hazel," my dad said. "Can I come in?" I didn't answer, but after a while I unlocked the door. I sat down on the closed toilet seat. Why did breathing have to be such work? Dad knelt down next to me. He grabbed my head and pulled it into his collarbone, and he said, "I'm sorry Gus died." I felt kind of suffocated by his T-shirt, but it felt good to be held so hard, pressed into the comfortable smell of my dad. It was almost like he was angry or something, and I liked that, because I was angry, too. "It's total bullshit," he said. "The whole thing. Eighty percent survival rate and he's in the twenty percent? Bullshit. He was such a bright kid. It's bullshit. I hate it. But it was sure a privilege to love him, huh?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“海蓁，”爸爸的声音，“我能进来吗？”我没有回答，但过了一会儿，还是去打开了门上的锁。我坐在盖上盖的马桶上，为什么呼吸非得这么费事不可呢？爸爸在我身边单膝跪下，抱住我的头，按在他锁骨上，说：“我很难过格斯死了。”我感觉好像被他的T恤闷得有些喘不过气来，但被紧紧地拥抱，紧紧地被令人安慰的爸爸味儿包围的感觉很好。他看上去几乎可以说是愤怒，而我喜欢这样，因为我也愤怒。“全是狗屎，”他说，“从头到尾。百分之八十的生存率，而他就正好是那百分之二十？这叫什么事啊？狗屎。那么生气勃勃的孩子。全是狗屎，太可恨了。但爱上他一定是一件特别幸运的事，啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neither of these futures struck me as particularly desirable. It seemed to me that I had already seen everything pure and good in the world, and I was beginning to suspect that even if death didn't get in the way, the kind of love that Augustus and I share could never last. So dawn goes down to day, the poet wrote. Nothing gold can stay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我看来，这两种未来都不甚合我心意。我觉得自己好像已经看尽世上所有纯洁美好的事物了，我开始怀疑，就算不是死亡冒出来搅了局，奥古斯塔斯和我所共同拥有过的那种爱也难以长久。“美好的清晨转眼成白昼。 ”诗人写道，“黄金的时光不能留。”">查看中文翻译</div>
