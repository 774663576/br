<div class="line_en">My sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something that I can describe only as a fierce split of my attention -- a stroke that at first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind movement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while I just fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively keeping him with his back to the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我因一时注意力分散而未注意到他对此的反应，我只能这样描述——我看到的景象让我一跃而起，疯狂地把迈尔斯抓住并盲目地拉到自己身边，当我倚靠在最近的一件家具上时，本能地让他背对着窗户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The appearance was full upon us that I had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们面前完全呈现出了一个我不得不应付的状况：彼得·昆特已经来到眼前，就像是监狱前的哨兵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to the glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room his white face of damnation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来我看到的是，他已经从外面抵达到窗前，然后我知道，他贴着玻璃正往里窥视，再一次将他那该死的苍白面容呈现在这个房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It represents but grossly what took place within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made; yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered her grasp of the ACT. It came to me in the very horror of the immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what I saw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware. The inspiration -- I can call it by no other name -- was that I felt how voluntarily, how transcendently, I MIGHT. It was like fighting with a demon for a human soul, and when I had fairly so appraised it I saw how the human soul -- held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm's length -- had a perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚看到这场景，我心里迟疑了片刻，接着便作出决定，我相信没有一个受到这样打击的女人，可以在如此短的时间内掌握全局。在即刻出现的异常恐惧之中，我想到的行动就是，直接面对我所看到的东西，不让迈尔斯察觉到。灵感——我不能用其他名字来称呼它——就是，我感到自己可以多么主动，多么超然。这就像是为了人类的灵魂与恶魔作战，而当我已经公正地对它作出了判断的时候，我看到这个人类的灵魂——在我颤抖的双手中，一臂的距离之内——那可爱的、孩子气的额头上有一滴完美的汗珠。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have likened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather the prowl of a baffled beast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到此话，我发出喜悦的呻吟声，把他紧紧地搂在了怀里。而当我把他搂在胸前时，我能从他突然发热的小身躯中感觉到他那小小的心脏在剧烈地跳动，我注视着窗边的幽灵，看着它移动并且变换姿势。我把那东西比作了哨兵，但它缓慢的运动在那一刻，更像是一只行动不便的野兽在徘徊。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was nothing there. I felt that the cause was mine and that I should surely get ALL. "And you found nothing!" -- I let my elation out. He gave the most mournful, thoughtful little headshake.

<div class="line_en">I felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was for the instant confounding and bottomless, for if he WERE innocent, what then on earth was I? Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh, he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep him from. "And did they repeat what you said?" I went on after a moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那一刻我感到困惑难解，因为，如果他是无辜的，那我到底是怎么回事呢？一切都在继续，我被这个一掠而过的问题吓瘫了，我放开了他一点儿，所以，他发出了一声深长的叹息，再一次转身背对着我，他面朝着明亮的窗子，这让我深感痛苦，我感觉现在没有什么可以对他回避的了。“然后他们复述了你所说的话？”稍后我继续说道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still to his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to convert the climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation.</div>
