<div class="line_en">The love he bore this woman, with whom he had fallen in love several months before, was so precious to him that he tried to create an independent space for her in his life, a restricted zone of purity. He was often invited to lecture at foreign universities, and now he accepted all offers. But because they were not enough to satisfy his new-found wanderlust, he took to inventing congresses and symposia as a means of justifying the new absences to his wife. His mistress, who had a flexible schedule, accompanied him on all speaking engagements, real and imagined. So it was that within a short span of time he introduced her to many European cities and an American one.</div>

<div class="line_en">Geneva is a city of fountains large and small, of parks where music once rang out from the bandstands. Even the university is hidden among trees. Franz had just finished his afternoon lecture. As he left the building, the sprinklers were spouting jets of water over the lawn and he was in a capital mood. He was on his way to see his mistress. She lived only a few streets away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日内瓦是一座泉城，有喷泉，有涌泉。城内的公园里还有音乐台，从前那里总演奏军乐。连大学都掩映在绿树之中。结束了上午的课后，弗兰茨走出大楼。旋转喷嘴里射出的水雾洒落在草坪上；他的心情极佳。从校园一出来，他便径直往女友家去，她住的地方只隔几条街。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He often stopped in for a visit, but only as a friend, never as a lover. If he made love to her in her Geneva studio, he would be going from one woman to the other, from wife to mistress and back in a single day, and because in Geneva husband and wife sleep together in the French style, in the same bed, he would be going from the bed of one woman to the bed of another in the space of several hours. And that, he felt, would humiliate both mistress and wife and, in the end, himself as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他常常到她家稍作停留，不过总是作为亲密的朋友，而绝非以情人身份。要是他与她在日内瓦的画室里做爱，那么他一天之中就得辗转于两个女人之间，先是妻子再是情妇，或者先是情妇后是妻子，而且，在日内瓦，夫妇按照法国式习惯同睡一床。如此一来，他在数小时内从一个女人的床转到另一个女人的床。对他来说，这样便会辱没了情妇与妻子，最终也辱没了他自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The only explanation I can suggest is that for Franz, love was not an extension of public life but its antithesis. It meant a longing to put himself at the mercy of his partner. He who gives himself up like a prisoner of war must give up his weapons as well. And deprived in advance of defense against a possible blow, he cannot help wondering when the blow will fall. That is why I can say that for Franz, love meant the constant expectation of a blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只能作出这样的解释：对他而言，爱情并不是社会生活的延续，而正与之相反。对他来说，爱情是一种甘心屈从于对方的意愿和控制的热望。委身于对方就如同投降的士兵一样，必须首先缴械。因此，自己没了防备，他便止不住担心那致命的一击何时降临。所以，我可以说，爱情之于弗兰茨，就是对死亡的不断等待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Franz attended to his anguish, his mistress put down her brush and went into the next room. She returned with a bottle of wine. She opened it without a word and poured out two glasses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他深陷在自己的惶恐之中时，女友搁下画笔，走出了房间。她回来时拿着一瓶葡萄酒，默默地打开酒瓶，斟满两杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How could he be so unsure of himself with her? She had not given him the slightest cause for worry! In fact, she was the one who had taken the erotic initiative shortly after they met. He was a good-looking man; he was at the peak of his scholarly career; he was even feared by his colleagues for the arrogance and tenacity he displayed during professional meetings and colloquia. Then why did he worry daily that his mistress was about to leave him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面对情妇时没有安全感，对此该作何解释呢？他没有任何理由不自信！在他们相遇不久之后，采取主动的是她，而不是他。他是个英俊的男人，正处学术生涯的顶峰，在专家的论战之中他所表现出的高明与执著甚至令同行忌怕。那么他为什么终日牵挂，担心女友会离他而去？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ban on making love with his painter-mistress in Geneva was actually a self-inflicted punishment for having married another woman. He felt it as a kind of guilt or defect. Even though his conjugal sex life was hardly worth mentioning, he and his wife still slept in the same bed, awoke in the middle of the night to each other's heavy breathing, and inhaled the smells of each other's body. True, he would rather have slept by himself, but the marriage bed is still the symbol of the marriage bond, and symbols, as we know, are inviolable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不与情妇在日内瓦做爱，实际上是他对自己作为有妇之夫的一种惩罚。他这样活着，像是个错误，又像是个缺憾。与妻子的性生活基本上乏善可陈，不过他们依然同床，夜晚他们会被对方刺耳的气息弄醒，呼吸着彼此的体臭。他当然更想单独睡，但同床仍旧是婚姻的标志，而标志，我们都知道，是不可触碰的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She raised her glass and emptied it in one swig. Franz did the same. He was naturally overjoyed that her refusal to go to Palermo was actually a call to love, but he was a bit sorry as well: his mistress seemed determined to violate the zone of Purity he had introduced into their relationship; she had failed to understand his apprehensive attempts to save their love from banality and separate it radically from his conjugal home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她举杯一饮而尽。弗兰茨也拿起他那杯喝了下去。发现拒绝去巴勒莫的建议实际上不过是为了求欢，他一定感到心满意足。可是他很快又觉得有些遗憾：女友已决意违反他在两人关系中引入的纯粹原则；她不明白，为了捍卫爱情，使之免于流俗，且将之彻底独立于婚姻之外，他多么焦虑，不安，付出了多少努力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Immediately he felt relieved and slightly ridiculous. The I prefer Geneva did not mean she refused to make love; quite the contrary, it meant she was tired of limiting their lovemaking to foreign cities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他感觉胸口一下如释重负。“我更喜欢日内瓦”这几个字并不意味着她不愿与他做爱，恰恰相反，在异国城市匆匆逗留，两人独处的时光实在有限，她有些受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing there in her skirt and bra, she suddenly (as if recalling only then that she was not alone in the room) fixed Franz with a long stare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她身上只剩半截裙和胸罩。然后（似乎她是突然记起屋子里还有人），她长时间地望着弗兰茨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His painter-mistress poured herself another glass of wine, drank it down, and then, still silent and with a curious nonchalance, as if completely unaware of Franz's presence, slowly removed her blouse. She was behaving like an acting student whose improvisation assignment is to make the class believe she is alone in a room and no one can see her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又为自己倒了一杯，喝下一口，然后默不作声，带着一种奇怪的漠然神情，仿佛弗兰茨不在身边似的。她缓缓地脱去罩衫。那动作像是戏剧课的学生在即兴表演，要旁若无人地表现出独处时自己的本来面貌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Each time he lay down next to his wife in that bed, he thought of his mistress imagining him lying down next to his wife in that bed, and each time he thought of her he felt ashamed. That was why he wished to separate the bed he slept in with his wife as far as possible in space from the bed he made love in with his mistress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次他上床躺在妻子身边时，他总想到他的女友也正想象着他上床在妻子身边躺下。每次这个念头都令他羞愧。因此，他希望与妻子睡觉的床和他同情人做爱的床，尽可能离得远远的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That stare bewildered him; he could not understand it. All lovers unconsciously establish their own rules of the game, which from the outset admit no transgression. The stare she had just fixed on him fell outside their rules; it had nothing in common with the looks and gestures that usually preceded their lovemaking. It was neither provocative nor flirtatious, simply interrogative.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这目光看得他很不安，因为他不明其意。情人之间都会很快形成一些游戏规则，也许他们意识不到，但这些规则拥有法律般的效力，不可违抗。她刚才看他的目光超越了规则，与他们平日相拥之前的眼神和动作毫无共同之处。那眼神既无挑逗亦无媚态，不如说是一种诘问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near the mirror stood a wig stand with an old black bowler hat on it. She bent over, picked up the hat, and put it on her head. The image in the mirror was instantaneously transformed: suddenly it was a woman in her undergarments, a beautiful, distant, indifferent woman with a terribly out-of-place bowler hat on her head, holding the hand of a man in a gray suit and a tie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地上，镜子的下边，有个假头，上面戴着一顶旧圆礼帽。她弯下腰，拿起帽子，将它安在自己头上。镜中的影像马上变了：出现了一个只着内衣的女人，美丽而又冷漠，难以接近，头上戴的那顶圆礼帽显得很不协调。她手牵着一位身穿灰色西服、打着领带的男子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next she stepped out of her skirt and, taking Franz by the hand, turned him in the direction of a large mirror propped against the wall. Without letting go of his hand, she looked into the mirror with the same long questioning stare, training it first on herself, then on him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她脱下裙子，抓住他的一只手，拉着他转向几步外斜靠在墙上的一面大镜子。她紧拽着他的手不放，望向镜中，以那种深长的诘问的目光，一会儿看她自己，一会儿看他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The problem was, Franz had not the slightest notion what it was asking.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again he had to smile at how poorly he understood his mistress. When she took her clothes off, it wasn't so much erotic provocation as an odd little caper, a happening a deux. His smile beamed understanding and consent.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was in an excellent mood again. Geneva, which he had cursed all his life as the metropolis of boredom, now seemed beautiful and full of adventure. Outside in the street, he looked back up at the studio's broad window. It was late spring and hot. All the windows were shaded with striped awnings. Franz walked to the park. At its far end, the golden cupolas of the Orthodox church rose up like two gilded cannonballs kept from imminent collapse and suspended in the air by some invisible Power. Everything was beautiful. Then he went down to the embankment and took the public transport boat to the north bank of the lake, where he lived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又恢复了好心情。他一辈子都在咒骂日内瓦是个烦心之都，可今天它看起来既美丽又充满奇遇。他转过头去，抬眼望向画室的玻璃窗。时值春末，天气热了，所有的窗子都拉上了条纹帘子。弗兰茨走到一处公园，远处的上空，浮现出东正教教堂的一片圆顶，宛若几只金球，在坠落之前被一股无形的力量托住，悬在空中。很美。弗兰茨走向码头去搭乘客轮，客轮将他载回湖对面的右岸，那是他住的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The time for the happening had come and gone. Franz was beginning to feel that the caper (which, in and of itself, he was happy to think of as charming) had dragged on too long. So he gently took the brim of the bowler hat between two fingers, lifted it off Sabina's head with a smile, and laid it back on the wig stand. It was as though he were erasing the mustache a naughty child had drawn on a picture of the Virgin Mary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场机遇剧持续的时间超过了极限。弗兰茨觉得这场闹剧（当然，他乐意承认的确有趣）拖得太长了一点。他小心翼翼地用两个手指夹住那顶圆礼帽，微笑着从萨比娜头上取下来，将它放回底座上，如同为圣母马利亚像拭去被顽童涂上的胡须。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For several more seconds she remained motionless, staring at herself in the mirror. Then Franz covered her with tender kisses and asked her once more to go with him in ten days to Palermo. This time she said yes unquestioningly, and he left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她仍一动不动地呆了好几秒钟，在镜中凝视着。弗兰茨便不断温柔地亲吻她，再次恳请她十天后陪他一块儿去巴勒莫。这次她没有回绝，于是他就离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
