<div class="line_en">They had walked from the Nightfort to Deep Lake, and from Deep Lake to Queensgate, following a narrow track from one castle to the next, never out of sight of the Wall. A day and a half from Castle Black, as they trudged along on callused feet, Gilly heard horses behind them, and turned to see a column of black riders coming from the west. "My brothers," Sam assured her. "No one uses this road but the Night's Watch." It had turned out to be Ser Denys Mallister from the Shadow Tower, along with the wounded Bowen Marsh and the survivors from the fight at the Bridge of Skulls. When Sam saw Dywen, Giant, and Dolorous Edd Tollett, he broke down and wept.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing that his brothers told him prepared him for what he found at Castle Black, however. The common hall had burned to the ground and the great wooden stair was a mound of broken ice and scorched timbers. Donal Noye was dead, along with Rast, Deaf Dick, Red Alyn, and so many more, yet the castle was more crowded than Sam had ever seen; not with black brothers, but with the king's soldiers, more than a thousand of them. There was a king in the King's Tower for the first time in living memory, and banners flew from the Lance, Hardin's Tower, the Grey Keep, the Shieldhall, and other buildings that had stood empty and abandoned for long years. "The big one, the gold with the black stag, that's the royal standard of House Baratheon," he told Gilly, who had never seen banners before. "The fox-and-flowers is House Florent. The turtle is Estermont, the swordfish is Bar Emmon, and the crossed trumpets are for Wensington."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然弟兄们把黑城堡的情形告诉过他，但亲眼目睹之后还是难以接受。大厅已烧成平地，巨大的木楼梯也化为一片焦木碎冰的瓦砾。唐纳·诺伊、雷斯特、聋子迪克、红埃林等等，他们都死了；而山姆从没见过城堡如此拥挤。超过一千名国王的士兵占据了它，国王塔中真的有了国王，在现世的人们记忆中，这还是头一遭。长枪塔、哈丁塔、灰堡、盾牌厅及其他废弃多年的建筑物顶上此刻都飘扬着旗帜。“那面最大的，金色的，有一头黑鹿，那是拜拉席恩家族的王旗，”他告诉吉莉，吉莉没见过任何旗帜，“狐狸与鲜花代表佛罗伦家族。海龟代表伊斯蒙家族，剑鱼代表巴尔艾蒙家族，交叉的喇叭代表文辛顿家族。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was from them that he learned about the battle beneath the Wall. "Stannis landed his knights at Eastwatch, and Cotter Pyke led him along the ranger's roads, to take the wildlings unawares," Giant told him. "He smashed them. Mance Rayder was taken captive, a thousand of his best slain, including Harma Dogshead. The rest scattered like leaves before a storm, we heard." The gods are good, Sam thought. If he had not gotten lost as he made his way south from Craster's Keep, he and Gilly might have walked right into the battle… or into Mance Rayder's camp, at the very least. That might have been well enough for Gilly and the boy, but not for him. Sam had heard all the stories about what wildlings did with captured crows. He shuddered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他们那儿，他听说了长城脚下的战斗。“史坦尼斯让他的骑士在东海望登陆，随后由卡特·派克带路沿游骑兵的巡逻道过来偷袭野人，”巨人解释，“他击溃了他们。曼斯·雷德被俘，其手下上千名骨干被杀，包括‘狗头’哈犸在内。其余人像暴风雨中的树叶一样四散逃窜，大家都这么说。”诸神保佑，山姆心想，如果没有迷路，而是从卡斯特的堡垒往南走，他和吉莉可能径直走进战场…至少是曼斯·雷德的营地。那样对吉莉和孩子来说也许还好，对他可不是。山姆听过野人处置乌鸦的各种故事，不禁浑身颤栗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He found out soon enough. "Queen's men," Pyp told him -- after he let out a whoop, and shouted, "Run and bar the doors, lads, it's Sam the Slayer come back from the grave," while Grenn was hugging Sam so hard he thought his ribs might break -- "but best you don't go asking where the queen is. Stannis left her at Eastwatch, with their daughter and his fleet. He brought no woman but the red one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="答案来得很快。“那属于后党，”派普告诉他——接着一声尖呼，喊道，“快跑，伙计们，闩上门，‘杀手’山姆从坟墓里出来了。”同时葛兰上前使劲拥抱，他觉得肋骨都快断了——“别乱打听王后的事。史坦尼斯将她留在东海望，跟他们的女儿和舰队一起。除了那红袍女，他没带别的女人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon had done more than well himself, to hear Grenn tell it. Yet even capturing the Horn of Winter and a wildling prince had not been enough for Ser Alliser Thorne and his friends, who still named him turncloak. Though Maester Aemon said his wound was healing well, Jon bore other scars, deeper than the ones around his eye. He grieves for his wildling girl, and for his brothers.</div>

<div class="line_en">More guards were posted on the steps outside the tower. These were king's men, though; Sam had quickly learned the difference. The king's men were as earthy and impious as any other soldiers, but the queen's men were fervid in their devotion to Melisandre of Asshai and her Lord of Light.

"Snow," they cried at him. "Snow, snow, snow" He had taught them that. Even with the newcomers, the ravenry seemed dismally empty. Few of the birds that Aemon had sent off had returned as yet. One reached Stannis, though. One found Dragonstone, and a king who still cared. A thousand leagues south, Sam knew, his father had joined House Tarly to the cause of the boy on the Iron Throne, but neither King Joffrey nor little King Tornmen had bestirred himself when the Watch cried out for help. What good is a king who will not defend his realm? he thought angrily, remembering the night on the Fist of the First Men and the terrible trek to Craster's Keep through darkness, fear, and falling snow.
