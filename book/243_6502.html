<div class="line_en">By now I had been in Brobdingnag for about two years. When the King and Queen travelled to the south coast, Glumdalclitch and I went with them. I really wanted to be close to the sea again, which I had not seen or even smelt for so long. As Glumdalclitch was ill, I asked a young servant to take me down to the beach for some fresh air. The boy carried me in my travelling box, and put me down on the beach, while he looked for birds' eggs among the rocks. I looked sadly at the sea, but stayed in my box, and after a while I fell asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was woken suddenly when my box was lifted high in the air. I can only suppose that a large bird took hold of the ring on top of the box with his talons, and flew away with it. Through the windows I could see the sky and clouds passing by, and I could hear the noise of the bird's wings. Then I was falling, so fast that I felt quite breathless. There was a loud crash, as the box fell into the sea. Perhaps the bird had been attacked by others, and so had to drop what he was carrying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的盒子被提到高空中，把我突然惊醒了。我只能猜测一只大鸟的爪子抓住了我盒子顶部的环，带着它飞走了。透过窗户我可以看见天空和云彩飞逝，我还可以听见鸟翅膀的声音。然后我往下跌，快得我觉得几乎透不过气。盒子掉进海水里，溅起很响的水声。也许这鸟儿受到什么袭击，所以不得不丢下它抓的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was still hoping to return to England one day. But the ship in which I had arrived in Brobdingnag was the first that had ever come near the coast. So I could not see how I could get away. I began to think more and more about my family and my home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仍然希望有朝一日回到英国。可是我到达布罗卜丁奈格时乘坐的轮船是第一只曾经靠近此处海岸的。所以我不知道怎样才能逃离。我开始越来越想念我的家人和自己的家了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Luckily, the box had been well made, and not much sea water came in. But I do not think any traveller has ever been in a worse situation than I was then. I wondered how long I would survive, with no food or drink in the middle of the ocean. I felt sure I would never see poor Glumdalclitch again, and I knew how sad she would be to lose me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸亏盒子做得很好，没有多少海水流进来，不过我想没有多少旅行者比我此时的处境更糟糕。我思忖着，在大洋之中，没有食物，没有饮水，我能生存多久。我确切地感到再也见不着可怜的葛兰达克利赤了，我知道失去我她将多么悲伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Help! Help!" I shouted as loudly as I could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“救命！救命！”我竭力大声喊叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Several hours passed, and then I suddenly heard a strange noise above my head People were fastening a rope to the ring. Then my box was pulled through the water. Was it a ship that was pulling me along?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时之后，我忽然听见头上有个奇怪的声音，有人正在环上系绳子，然后我的盒子在水中被拖动。是一个轮船在拖着我走吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed, because I had been with giants for so long, I had forgotten that my countrymen were as small as me. The only thing the sailors could do was to cut a hole in the top of my box, and help me to climb out. I was exhausted and unable to walk far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，因为我和巨人在一起太久了，我忘了我的国人是和我一样小的。这些水手唯一能做的是在我的盒子顶部挖一个洞、帮我爬出来。我累坏了，不能走远。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Welcome to my ship," he said kindly. "You're lucky we found you. My men saw that huge box on the water, and we decided to pull it along behind the ship. Then we realized there was a man inside! Why were you locked up in there? Was it a punishment for some terrible crime? But tell me all about it later. Now you need to sleep, and then eat."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I told him my story, a few hours later, he found it difficult to believe. But after a while he began to accept that what I told him must be true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时之后，我告诉他我的经历，他觉得难以置信。不过过了一会儿他开始接受我所告诉他的是真的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But why do you shout so loudly?" he asked. "We can hear you perfectly well if you speak normally."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是你为什么叫喊那么大声音？”他问，“如果你正常地说话我们也能听得很清楚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see," I explained, "for two years I've had to shout to make myself understood by the giants. I was like a man in the street who was trying to talk to another man at the top of a very tall building. And another thing -- your sailors all seem very small to me, because I've been used to looking up at people twenty metres tall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，”我解释说，“两年来我不得不大声喊叫以便让我能被巨人听清楚。我就像一个走在大街上的人，要跟在一座非常高的建筑物顶上的另一个人说话。还有一件事，你的水手在我看起来都非常小，因为我以经习惯了仰着头看20米高的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stayed on the ship for several months, as we sailed slowly home to England. Finally, we arrived in Bristol on June 3rd,1706. When I reached home, my wife made me promise never to go to sea again, and I thought my adventures had come to an end.</div>
