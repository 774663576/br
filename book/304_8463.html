<div class="line_en">It was five o'clock on a winter's morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express. It consisted of a kitchen and dining car, a sleeping car and two local coaches.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the step leading up into the sleeping car stood a young French lieutenant, resplendent in uniform, conversing with a small lean man, muffled up to the ears, of whom nothing was visible but a pink-tipped nose and the two points of an upward curled moustache.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was freezingly cold, and this job of seeing off a distinguished stranger was not one to be envied, but Lieutenant Dubosc performed his part manfully. Graceful phrases fell from his lips in polished French. Not that he knew what it was all about. There had been rumours, of course, as there always were in such cases. The General -- his General's -- temper had grown worse and worse. And then there had come this Belgian stranger -- all the way from England, it seemed. There had been a week -- a week of curious tensity. And then certain things had happened. A very distinguished officer had committed suicide, another had resigned -- anxious faces had suddenly lost their anxiety, certain military precautions were relaxed. And the General -- Lieutenant Dubosc's own particular General -- had suddenly looked ten years younger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气寒冷，为一位高贵的陌生人送行这份工作可不怎么令人羡慕，但中尉迪博斯克还是勇敢地坚守在岗位上，用优雅的法语说着优美的词句。实际上，他并不明白这一切究竟是怎么回事。当然，在这种情况下总有一些谣言。将军——他的将军——的脾气越来越坏。然后来了一个陌生的比利时人，好像是大老远从英国过来的。过了一星期——无缘无故紧张的一星期——再后来发生了某些事，一位很有名的军官自杀了，另外一位突然宣布辞职，那些焦虑的脸上忽然没有了焦虑，一些军事防御措施也放松了，而将军，迪博斯克中尉的顶头上司，好像忽然年轻了十岁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dubosc had overheard part of a conversation between him and the stranger.

<div class="line_en">To which the stranger (by name M. Hercule Poirot) had made a fitting reply including the phrase, "But indeed do I not remember that once you saved my life?"

<div class="line_cn" title="这个陌生人（他的名字是赫尔克里·波洛）回答得很得体，其中有这么一句：“可你确实救过我的命，我怎么能忘记呢？”接着将军也很得体地做了回答，表示过去的那件事不值一提。又提到了法国、比利时、光荣与荣耀诸如此类的话题，彼此热情拥抱之后结束了谈话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As to what it had all been about, Lieutenant Dubosc was still in the dark, but to him had been delegated the duty of seeing off M.

<div class="line_en">This must be Aleppo. Nothing to see, of course. Just a long, poor-lighted platform with loud furious altercations in Arabic going on somewhere. Two men below her window were talking French. One was a French officer, the other was a little man with enormous moustaches. She smiled faintly. She had never seen anyone quite so heavily muffled up. It must be very cold outside. That was why they heated the train so terribly. She tried to force the window down lower, but it would not go.</div>

Colonel Arbuthnot talked of the Punjab, and occasionally asked the girl a few questions about Baghdad where it became clear that she had been in a post as governess. In the course of conversation they discovered some mutual friends which had the immediate effect of making them more friendly and less stiff. They discussed old Tommy Somebody and Jerry Someone Else. The Colonel inquired whether she was going straight through to England or whether she was stopping in Stamboul.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Colonel, Hercule Poirot noticed, accompanied her back to her compartment. Later they passed through the magnificent scenery of the Taurus. As they looked down towards the Cilician Gates, standing in the corridor side by side, a sigh came suddenly from the girl. Poirot was standing near them and heard her murmur:</div>

After about ten minutes, however, he decided that a breath of air would not perhaps be a bad thing, after all.
