<div class="line_en">"Lord of Light, defend us. The night is dark and full of terrors. " Queen Selyse led the responses, her pinched face full of fervor. King Stannis stood beside her, jaw clenched hard, the points of his red-gold crown shimmering whenever he moved his head. He is with them, but not of them, Davos thought. Princess Shireen was between them, the mottled grey patches on her face and neck almost black in the firelight.</div>

<div class="line_en">The title still rang queer in his ears, yet Davos turned away from the window. "Aye. It's time." Stannis, Melisandre, and the queen's men would be at their prayers an hour or more. The red priests lit their fires every day at sunset, to thank R'hllor for the day just ending, and beg him to send his sun back on the morrow to banish the gathering darkness. A smuggler must know the tides and when to seize them. That was all he was at the end of the day; Davos the smuggler. His maimed hand rose to his throat for his luck, and found nothing. He snatched it down and walked a bit more quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一头衔在他耳中至今仍显怪异，但戴佛斯转身离开窗口。“对，是时候了。”史坦尼斯、梅莉珊卓及后党人士还要再祈祷一个小时，甚至更久。红袍祭司每天日落时分都燃起火堆，为即将结束的一日感谢拉赫洛，并请求他第二天重新带回太阳，驱逐凝聚的黑暗。走私者必须了解海潮，懂得捕捉风向。说到底，那是唯一适合他的身份：走私者戴佛斯。伤残的手伸向喉咙的幸运符，却什么也没找到。他甩开胳膊，加快步伐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fire is a living thing," the red woman told him, when he asked her to teach him how to see the future in the flames. "It is always moving, always changing… like a book whose letters dance and shift even as you try to read them. It takes years of training to see the shapes beyond the flames, and more years still to learn to tell the shapes of what will be from what may be or what was. Even then it comes hard, hard. You do not understand that, you men of the sunset lands." Davos asked her then how it was that Ser Axell had learned the trick of it so quickly, but to that she only smiled enigmatically and said, "Any cat may stare into a fire and see red mice at play."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“圣火是有生命的，”当初戴佛斯要红袍女教他如何透过火焰瞥见未来，她解释道，“它变化雀跃，从不静止…就像一本不停翻动的书，想看也看不清。首先需要多年刻苦训练，才能目睹火焰中的形影，而后又需更多年，才能分辨哪些影子属于将来，哪些影子属于现在，哪些影子属于过去。无论如何，过程相当艰难，应该说很难。你们是不明白的，你们日落国度的人从来就不明白。”戴佛斯不依不饶地追问，亚赛尔爵士如何能很快领悟其中诀窍，对此，她只神秘地微笑，“任何一只凝视火焰的猫都会看到嬉戏的红老鼠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His companions kept pace, matching their strides to his own. The Bastard of Nightsong had a pox-ravaged face and an air of tattered chivalry; Ser Gerald Gower was broad, bluff, and blond; Ser Andrew Estermont stood a head taller, with a spade-shaped beard and shaggy brown eyebrows. They were all good men in their own ways, Davos thought. And they will all be dead men soon, if this night's work goes badly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伙伴们紧随在后，跟上他的脚程。夜歌城的私生子有张被麻疹破坏的脸庞，也带着邋遢的骑士风度；杰拉德·高尔爵士一头金发，身形宽阔，直率粗鲁；安德鲁·伊斯蒙爵士比旁人高一头，铁铲形的胡子，浓密的棕眉毛。他们性情各异，却都是好人，戴佛斯心想，但若今晚之事有所差池，全都难逃一死。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Stone Drum loomed huge ahead of him. The guards at the door uncrossed their spears as he approached. Not for the onion knight, but for the King's Hand. Davos was the Hand going in, at least.

<div class="line_en">The steps seemed longer and steeper than before, or perhaps it was just that he was tired. The Mother never made me for tasks like this. He had risen too high and too fast, and up here on the mountain the air was too thin for him to breathe. As a boy he'd dreamed of riches, but that was long ago. Later, grown, all he had wanted was a few acres of good land, a hall to grow old in, a better life for his sons. The Blind Bastard used to tell him that a clever smuggler did not overreach, nor draw too much attention to himself. A few acres, a timbered roof, a "ser" before my name, I should have been content. If he survived this night, he would take Devan and sail home to Cape Wrath and his gentle Marya.

<div class="line_en">The Chamber of the Painted Table was dark and empty when Davos entered; the king would still be at the nightfire, with Melisandre and the queen's men. He knelt and made a fire in the hearth, to drive the chill from the round chamber and chase the shadows back into their corners. Then he went around the room to each window in turn, opening the heavy velvet curtains and unlatching the wooden shutters. The wind came in, strong with the smell of salt and sea, and pulled at his plain brown cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯进入图桌厅时，内里阴郁空洞，国王仍在夜火边，跟梅莉珊卓和后党人士一起。他跪在壁炉边生火，以将寒气逐出圆形房间，把阴影赶回角落之中。完成之后，他绕着屋子，依次走到每扇窗前，拉起厚重的天鹅绒窗帘，打开木窗户。风吹进来，充满海水的咸味，撩动他朴素的绿棕色披风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the north window, he leaned against the sill for a breath of the cold night air, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mad Prendos raising sail, but the sea seemed black and empty as far as the eye could see. Is she gone already? He could only pray that she was, and the boy with her. A half moon was sliding in and out amongst thin high clouds, and Davos could see familiar stars. There was the Galley, sailing west; there the Crone's Lantern, four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze. The clouds hid most of the Ice Dragon, all but the bright blue eye that marked due north. The sky is full of smugglers' stars. They were old friends, those stars; Davos hoped that meant good luck.</div>
