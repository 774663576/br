<div class="line_en">Or he would ask her at night, when he accompanied her on some mission invented by Mrs Crick to give him the opportunity. This was mostly a journey to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how the advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they were relegated. For it was a time of the year that brought great changes to the world of kine. Batches of the animals were sent away daily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their calves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could walk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy. In the interval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was, of course, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been taken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">The meads were changing now; but it was still warm enough in early afternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and the state of dairy-work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling. Looking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening ripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary, like the track of moonlight on the sea. Gnats, knowing nothing of their brief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this pathway, irradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out of its line, and were quite extinct. In the presence of these things he would remind her that the date was still the question.</div>

<div class="line_en">Returning from one of these dark walks they reached a great gravel-cliff immediately over the levels, where they stood still and listened. The water was now high in the streams, squirting through the weirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all full; there was no taking short cuts anywhere, and foot-passengers were compelled to follow the permanent ways. From the whole extent of the invisible vale came a multitudinous intonation; it forced upon their fancy that a great city lay below them, and that the murmur was the vociferation of its populace.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was seeing it then. To decline to marry him after all -- in obedience to her emotion of last night -- and leave the dairy, meant to go to some strange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in request now calving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm where no divine being like Angel Clare was. She hated the thought, and she hated more the thought of going home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来她逐渐认识到这一点。要是她听从了自己昨天晚上的感情，拒绝和他结婚……她就得离开奶牛场，也就是说，她得到一个陌生的地方去，而不是一个奶牛场。正在来临的生小牛犊的季节是不需要多少挤奶女工的；所以她去的地方就会是一个从事耕种的农场，在那儿没有安琪尔·克莱尔这种天神一样的人物。她恨这种想法，她尤其恨回家的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they reached the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were promptly told -- with injunctions to secrecy; for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible. The dairyman, though he had thought of dismissing her soon, now made a great concern about losing her. What should he do about his skimming? Who would make the ornamental butterpats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies? Mrs Crick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last come to an end, and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man; Tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival; that she was of a good family she could have sworn. In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember thinking that Tess was graceful and good-looking as she approached; but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite Angel Clare's plausible representations to himself and to Tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a later date. He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him. He had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes. Unsophistication was a thing to talk of; but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here. Yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly, and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life. The secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管安棋尔·克莱尔对自己、对苔丝都说他们立即结婚是一种实际需要，也说得似乎有道理，但是实际上他这样做总是有点儿轻率的，因为这一点在后来是十分明显的。他很爱苔丝，但是同苔丝对他的爱比起来，他的爱是偏于理想的爱，耽于想象的爱，而苔丝的爱却是一种热烈的爱，一种情深意浓的爱。在他注定要过他从前想过的那种无需动脑力的田园生活的时候，他没有想到在这种场景后面会发现一个美妙的姑娘，也没有想到这个姑娘竟是这样的迷人。天真朴素本来只是在嘴上说说而已，但是等他到了这里，才发现自己真正被天真朴素打动了。不过他对自己未来要走的路并没有看得十分清楚，也许还要一两年他才能考虑真正开创自己的生活。他知道，由于家庭的偏见，他被迫放弃了自己真正的事业，秘密就在于他的事业和性格都带上了不顾一切的色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the sense of a will. The word had been given; the number of the day written down. Her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to field-folk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellow-creatures; and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested, characteristic of the frame of mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝现在已经由不得自己了，只好随着时光的流逝得过且过。她答应嫁给他了；婚期也定了下来。她天生头脑敏锐，现在也开始接受宿命论的观点了，变得同种地的人一样了，同那些与自然现象联系多而与人类联系少的人一样了。她的情人说什么，她就被动地回答什么，这就是苔丝现在心情的特点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the wedding-day; really to again implore her advice. It was a gentleman who had chosen her, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered. A post-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man, might not be received with the same feeling by him. But this communication brought no reply from Mrs Durbeyfield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她又重新给她的母亲写了一封信，表面上是通知她结婚的日期，实际上是想再请她的母亲帮她拿主意。娶她的是一个上等人，这一点她的母亲也许还没有充分考虑到。要是婚后再给以解释，这对于一个不太在乎的人来说也许就用轻松的心情接受了，但是对他来说也许就不能用同样的心情接受了。不过她写出去的信却没有收到德北菲尔德太太的回信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The reason was a good one, so far as it went. His influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits, his speech and phrases, his likings and his aversions. And to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him. He wished to have her under his charge for another reason. His parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement, English or colonial; and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention, he judged that a couple of months' life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal -- her presentation to his mother at the Vicarage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next, he wished to see a little of the working of a flour-mill, having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corn-growing. The proprietor of a large old water-mill at Wellbridge -- once the mill of an Abbey -- had offered him the inspection of his time-honoured mode of procedure, and a hand in the operations for a few days, whenever he should choose to come. Clare paid a visit to the place, some few miles distant, one day at this time, to inquire particulars, and returned to Talbothays in the evening. She found him determined to spend a short time at the Wellbridge flour-mills. And what had determined him? Less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'Urberville family. This was always how Clare settled practical questions; by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them. They decided to go immediately after the wedding, and remain for a fortnight, instead of journeying to towns and inns.</div>

<div class="line_en">But to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess notwithstanding, who had well-nigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history. How events were favouring her!</div>

<div class="line_en">But everything went smoothly. She wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock, or if she ought to buy a new one. The question was set at rest by his forethought, disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her. Inside them she found a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to shoes, including a perfect morning costume, such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned. He entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages, and heard her upstairs undoing them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是一切都进行得很顺利。她心里想，在他们结婚的时候，他是喜欢她穿现在穿的这件最好的白色长袍呢，还是她应该再去买一件新的。这个问题他早就想到了，解决了。有一天，邮局给她送来了一个寄给她的大包裹，她打开一看，发现里面是全套的衣服，从帽子到鞋子，还包括早上穿的服装，样样都有，像他们计划中的简单婚礼，那些服装是再合适不过了。在她收到包裹后不久，克莱尔进了屋子，听见了她在楼上打开包裹的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
