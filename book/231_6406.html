<div class="line_en">Then one stormy winter day a train crawled into the station: two students in army greatcoats, with rifles slung over their shoulders, and a detachment of revolutionary soldiers wearing red armbands jumped out onto the platform and arrested the station gendarmes, an old colonel and the chief of the garrison.

<div class="line_en">One day in the spring of nineteen eighteen, three chums on their way from Sergei Bruzzhak's where they had been playing cards dropped into the Korchagins' garden and threw themselves on the grass. They were bored. All the customary occupations had begun to pall, and they were beginning to rack their brains for some more exciting way to spend the day when they heard the clatter of horses' hoofs behind them and saw a horseman come galloping down the road. With one bound the horse cleared the ditch between the road and the low garden fence and the rider waved his whip at Pavel and Klim. "Hi there, my lads, come over here!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一九一八年的春天，三个好朋友在谢廖沙家玩了一阵子“六十六点”，就跑出来，到柯察金家小园子的草地上躺了下来。真是无聊，平时的那些游戏都玩腻了。他们开始动脑筋，怎么才能更好地消磨这一天的时间。这时，背后响起了得得的马蹄声，一个骑马的人沿着大路疾驰而来。那马一纵身，跳过了公路和小园子的低矮栅栏之间的排水沟。骑马的人朝躺在地上的保尔和克利姆卡挥了挥马鞭，说：“喂，小伙子们，过来！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over by the forest warden's cottage, which was barely visible among the trees, they saw men and carts emerging from the woods, and nearer still on the highway a party of fifteen or so mounted men with rifles across their pommels. At the head of the horsemen rode an elderly man in khaki jacket and officer's belt with field glasses slung on his chest, and beside him the man the boys had just spoken to.

<div class="line_en">Bulgakov had spread out a map of the gubernia on the table and was now running his finger over it. "You say we ought to put up a stand here, Comrade Yermachenko," he said, addressing a man with broad features and prominent teeth, "but I think we must move out in the morning. Better still if we could get going during the night, but the men are in need of a rest. Our task is to withdraw to Kazatin before the Germans get there. To resist with the strength we have would be ridiculous… One gun with thirty rounds of ammunition, two hundred infantry and sixty cavalry. A formidable force, isn't it, when the Germans are advancing in an avalanche of steel. We cannot put up a fight until we join up with other withdrawing Red units. Besides, Comrades, we must remember that apart from the Germans there'll be numerous counter-revolutionary bands of all kinds to deal with en route. I propose that we withdraw in the morning after first blowing up the railway bridge beyond the station. It'll take the Germans two or three days to repair it and in the meantime their advance along the railway will be held up. What do you think, Comrades? We must decide…" he turned to the others around the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布尔加科夫在桌上打开一张本省地图，一边在图上移动指甲，寻找路线，一边向对面那个长着一口结实牙齿的高颧骨的人说：“叶尔马琴科同志，你说要在这儿打一仗，我倒认为应该明天一早就撤走。今天连夜撤最好，不过大家太累了。我们的任务是抢在德国人的前头，先赶到卡扎京。拿我们现有的这点兵力去抵抗，简直是开玩笑……一门炮，三十发炮弹，二百个步兵和六十个骑兵——能顶什么用……德国人正像洪水一样涌来。我们只有和其他后撤的红军部队联合在一起，才能作战。同志，我们还必须注意，除了德国人之外，沿路还有许多各式各样的反革命匪帮。我的意见是，明天一早就撤，把车站后面的那座小桥炸掉。德国人修桥得花两三天的时间。这样，他们暂时就不能沿铁路线往前推进了。同志们，你们的意见怎么样？咱们决定一下吧。”他对在座的人说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为应当把水兵朱赫来留下来。”叶尔马琴科走到桌子跟前，说。“第一，朱赫来是本地人；第二，他又会钳工，又会电工，准能在车站上找到工作。另外，谁也没有看见他跟咱们的队伍在一起，他今天夜里才能赶到。这个人很有头脑，一定能把这儿的事情办好。依我看，他是最合适的人选。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now for the next question, liaison," Bulgakov proceeded. "Since we are the last to leave, it's our job to organise work in the German rear. This is a big railway junction and there are two stations in the town. We must see to it that there is a reliable comrade to carry on the work on the railway. We'll have to decide here whom to leave behind to get the work going. Have you anyone in mind?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“下一个是建立联系的问题。”布尔加科夫继续说。“因为咱们是最后一批撤，当然就得担负起组织敌后工作的任务。这儿是铁路枢纽站，地方不大，可是有两个车站。应当安排一个可靠的同志在车站上工作。现在咱们就决定一下，把谁留下来。大家提名吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now for the third and last question, Comrades. About the arms stored here in the town. There's quite a stock of rifles, twenty thousand of them, left over from the tsarist war and forgotten by everybody. They are piled up in a peasant's shed. I have this from the owner of the shed who happens to be anxious to get rid of them. We are not going to leave them to the Germans; in my opinion we ought to burn them, and at once, so as to have it over and done with by morning. The only trouble is that the fire might spread to the surrounding cottages. It's on the fringes of the town where the poor peasants live."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“同志们，现在讨论第三个，也是最后一个问题，”布尔加科夫接着说。“就是处理本地存放的武器问题。这儿存着一大批步枪，一共有两万支，还是沙皇那个时候打仗留下来的。这些枪支堆放在一个农民的棚子里，人们早都忘记了。棚子的主人把这件事告诉了我。他不愿再担这个风险……把这批枪留给德国人，当然是不行的。我认为应该把枪烧掉。马上就得动手，赶在天亮以前把一切都办妥。不过烧起来也有危险：棚子就在城边上，周围住的都是穷苦人，说不定会把农民的房子也烧掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bulgakov nodded. "I agree with you, Yermachenko. No objections, Comrades?" he turned to the others. "None. Then the matter is settled. We'll leave Zhukhrai some money and the credentials he'll need for his work…"</div>

At least there will be something to hit back with when the Germans make life impossible. They're bound to do their worst. And when things come to a head, the men will be able to take up arms. Struzhkov's right: the rifles must be distributed.

<div class="line_cn" title="“对，太对了！”叶尔马琴科热烈地拥护说。“把这些枪发给工人和别的老百姓，谁要就给谁。德国人要是逼得大家走投无路，这些枪至少可以给他们点颜色看看。德国人来了，日子肯定不好过。到了受不了的时候，人们就会拿起武器反抗。斯特鲁日科夫说得很好：把枪发下去。要是能运一些到乡下去，那就更好了。农民会把枪藏得更严实，一旦德国人征用老百姓的财物，逼得他们倾家荡产，嘿，你就瞧吧，这些可爱的枪支该能发挥多大作用啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At one o'clock in the afternoon, when the time limit expired, German soldiers began to take stock of their booty: fourteen thousand rifles. That meant that six thousand had not been turned in. The dragnet searches they conducted yielded very insignificant results.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went into the shed together. Artem took the rifle down from its hiding place on the beams, removed the bolt and bayonet, and seizing the weapon by the barrel swung it with all his might against a fence post. The butt splintered. What remained of the rifle was thrown far away into the waste lot beyond the garden. The bayonet and bolt Artem threw into the privy pit.</div>

And don't try any tricks, because if you do bring something like that home and they find it I'd be the first to be shot -- they wouldn't touch a youngster like you. These are brutal times, understand that!"</div>

At last the pit was ready. In it Sergei deposited the three brand-new rifles, carefully wrapped in rags: he had picked them up when the Red Guard detachment distributed arms to the people. He had no intention of giving them up to the Germans and had laboured hard all night to make sure that they were safely hidden.</div>
