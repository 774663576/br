<div class="line_en">Now all roads were running together to the East to meet the coming of war and the onset of the Shadow. And even as Pippin stood at the Great Gate of the City and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride in with his banners, the King of Rohan came down out of the hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，一切的力量都开始朝向东方集结，准备迎接即将到来的战火和魔影的攻击。正当皮聘站在主城的大门口，看着多尔安罗斯王带着旗帜前来的时候，骠骑王也正好从山脉中走了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad walls; and now through a stony gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale. The Riders followed it, and suddenly Harrowdale lay before them, loud with the noise of waters in the evening. There the white Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went rushing, fuming on the stones, down to Edoras and the green hills and the plains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty Starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but its jagged peak, clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon the East, red-stained by the sunset in the West.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山下还有一天行程的地方，有座跳跃的溪流从隘口一路流下，在松树耸峙而成的高墙间开出一条道路，穿越了多岩的山谷，流入宽广的河谷中。骠骑们跟着小溪前进，哈洛谷就这么毫无预警地出现在众人面前。雪界河在此和诸多的支流会合，在多岩的河床上冲激出巨大的声响，一路流向伊多拉斯和底下翠绿的山丘及平原。在山谷右方则是高耸的厉角山，它顶端参差不齐的山峰漂浮在云海上，盖着永恒不化的积雪，以无比的霸气俯视着东方，浑身沐浴在夕阳的猩红光辉中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Day was waning. In the last rays of the sun the Riders cast long pointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides. The king rode now slowly at the end of the day. Presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft-sighing trees. Down, down they went in a long winding file. When at last they came to the bottom of the gorge they found that evening had fallen in the deep places. The sun was gone. Twilight lay upon the waterfalls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳正渐渐消逝，骠骑们在最后一丝阳光中疾行，身体往前投射出长长的阴影。黑暗已经将山脚边的松林全都吞没，骠骑王在黄昏时降低了速度。小径绕过一颗裸露的岩石，俯头冲进低声呢喃的树林中。骠骑们排成长长一列队伍不停地往下走。最后，他们终于来到这座峡谷的末端，夜色已经降临了此地。太阳消失了，最后的夕阳照在眼前的瀑布上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was very tired, for though they had ridden slowly, they had ridden with very little rest. Hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had jogged up and down, over passes, and through long dales, and across many streams. Sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king's side, not noticing that many of the Riders smiled to see the two together: the hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony, and the Lord of Rohan on his great white horse. Then he had talked to Théoden, telling him about his home and the doings of the Shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark and its mighty men of old. But most of the time, especially on this last day, Merry had ridden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the men behind him using. It was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the Shire, yet he could not piece the words together. At times some Rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and Merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他觉得非常非常的疲倦，虽然他们前进的速度并不快，但中间没有多少休息的时间。在这三天中，他们不眠不休的攀上爬下，穿越狭长的山谷、度过许多小溪；有些时候，当路比较宽广的时候，他会和骠骑王比肩共骑。他并没有注意到有许多的骠骑看见这景象都露出微笑：哈比人骑着毛发蓬松的灰色小马，骠骑王骑着高大的灰白骏马，两者形成了非常强烈的对比。在这些时候，他会和希优顿王聊天，述说他的家乡和同胞们的故事，或是聆听骠骑们的传说，以及远古时先祖的伟大功业。不过，大多的时间，特别是在最后一天的时候，梅里只是跟着国王后面，一言不发地聆听着骠骑们所使用的缓慢语言。这种语言中似乎有许多他认识的字眼，但发音的方法却比夏尔的念法更为豪迈和富感情。只不过，虽然几乎每个字眼都认识，但他还是没办法把所有的字都凑在一起。有些时候，会有骠骑提高音量、唱起军歌，即使梅里完全听不懂歌词的内容，却还是会觉得热血沸腾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country, of which he had heard many tales upon their long road. It was a skyless world, in which his eye, through dim gulfs of shadowy air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great walls of stone behind great walls, and frowning precipices wreathed with mist. He sat for a moment half dreaming, listening to the noise of water, the whisper of dark trees, the crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound. He loved mountains, or he had loved the thought of them marching on the edge of stories brought from far away; but now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He longed to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里惊奇不已地看着这个陌生的国度，在这漫长的旅途上，他曾经听过许多关于这里的传说。这是个没有天空的山谷，在他的眼中只能看见不停攀升的岩壁，层层相叠，看起来毫无空隙，无数的山峰则是包围在迷雾中。他半梦半醒地坐在那边，倾听着流水的声响、树木的低语、岩石的撞击，以及在这一切之后等待的寂静。他喜欢山，或许，他喜欢的是走在传说边缘的感觉。只不过，现在他的肩头也必须同时背负着中土大陆沉重的负担，他只想要抛开这一切，躲在炉火边的安静小房间中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day's end. He wondered where in all this strange world Pippin had got to; and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. "I am forgetting them!" he said to himself reproachfully. "And yet they are more important than all the rest of us. And I came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away, if they are still alive." He shivered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但不论状况如何改变，他还是觉得十分的孤单，这天傍晚时，情况更是变本加厉，他开始想念不知混到这大千世界何处的皮聘，思索亚拉冈、勒苟拉斯和金雳的下场又会怎么样。然后，突然间，他想到了佛罗多和山姆，禁不住打了个冷颤。“我几乎都忘记他们了！”他懊悔地说。“但是，他们的任务其实比我们任何一个人都重要，我来此就是为了帮助他们。如果他们现在还活着，恐怕已经距离此地数百哩了！”光是想到这样的遭遇，他就觉得浑身发冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harrowdale at last!" said Éomer. "Our journey is almost at an end." They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse, as through a tall window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming below. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the river.</div>

<div class="line_en">Théoden smiled. "Nay, my son, for so I will call you, speak not the soft words of Wormtongue in my old ears!" He drew himself up and looked back at the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind. "Long years in the space of days it seems since I rode west; but never will I lean on a staff again. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the hills? And if it is won, what grief will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength? But we will leave this now. Tonight I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One evening of peace at least is left us. Let us ride on!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希优顿笑了。“不，吾儿，请让我这样称呼你，也请你别用巧言那一套温言软语来说服我！”他挺起胸膛，看着麾下的战士排成长列，融入夜色之中。“距离我策马西征以来，我感觉似乎经过了好多年，但我绝不会再倚靠任何的拐杖了。如果这场仗输了，躲在山中又有什么用处？如果这场仗赢了，就算我耗尽力气，马革裹尸又有什么好遗憾的？现在先不提这个，今晚我们先暂时在登哈洛过夜，至少我们还可以平静地度过一晚。走吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the deepening dusk they came down into the valley. Here the Snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of the dale, and soon the path led them to a ford where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the stones. The ford was guarded. As the king approached many men sprang up out of the shadow of the rocks; and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices: "Théoden King! Théoden King! The King of the Mark returns!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在逐渐笼罩的暮色之中，他们进入了山谷。雪界河在此流近山谷的西边，很快的，这条小径就带领他们来到可以通过激流的渡口。留守的人在渡口安排了重兵守卫，当骠骑王靠近的时候，许多男子从岩石的阴影间跳了出来，当他们发现眼前的正是国王时，纷纷欢欣地大喊：“希优顿王！希优顿王！骠骑王回来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the King of the Mark came back victorious out of the West to Dunharrow beneath the feet of the White Mountains. There he found the remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his coming was known captains rode to meet him at the ford, bearing messages from Gandalf. Dúnhere, chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale, was at their head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，骠骑王凯旋归来，回到了白色山脉下的登哈洛。他发现大部分的子民都已经聚集在这里了；当他出现的消息一传开来，将军们立刻骑马来到渡口晋见王上，并且带来了甘道夫的口信，哈洛谷的领主登希尔率领着其他人前来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"At dawn three days ago, lord," he said, "Shadowfax came like a wind out of the West to Edoras, and Gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts. But he brought also word from you to hasten the gathering of the Riders. And then came the winged Shadow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“王上，三天以前的黎明，”他说：“影疾像是一阵风般地从西方赶来伊多拉斯，甘道夫通知了我们您所打的胜仗，让我们感到欢欣鼓舞。但他也同时传达了您的旨意，要让骠骑迅速集结，然后，那有翼的魔影就出现了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The winged Shadow?" said Théoden. "We saw it also, but that was in the dead of night before Gandalf left us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe, lord," said Dúnhere. "Yet the same, or another like to it, a flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over Edoras that morning, and all men were shaken with fear. For it stooped upon Meduseld, and as it came low, almost to the gable, there came a cry that stopped our hearts. Then it was that Gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains. And he bade us to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked. So it has been done. Gandalf spoke with great authority. We trust that it is as you would wish. Naught has been seen in Harrowdale of these evil things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧，大人，”登希尔说：“但是那可能是同样的，或是另外一个会飞行的黑暗，它有着飞鸟的外形，那天早上越过了伊多拉斯，让所有的人都因恐惧而颤抖。它在宫殿上盘旋，当它往下俯冲，几乎撞上屋顶时，那刺耳的尖叫声几乎让我们心脏停止跳动。然后，甘道夫建议我们不要在平原上集结，而是在这山脉的掩护中和您会合，他也要求我们把灯火的数量降到最低。我们都照着做了，甘道夫说的话让人无法质疑，我们相信如果是您也会这样做的。后来，这些邪恶的东西就再也没出现在哈洛谷了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Flats and meads of rough grass, grey now in the falling night, lay all about, but in front on the far side of the dale Merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great roots of the Starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past.</div>

<div class="line_en">Merry wondered how many Riders there were. He could not guess their number in the gathering gloom, but it looked to him like a great army, many thousands strong. While he was peering from side to side the king's party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there suddenly the path began to climb, and Merry looked up in amazement. He was on a road the like of which he had never seen before, a great work of men's hands in years beyond the reach of song. Upwards it wound, coiling like a snake, boring its way across the sheer slope of rock. Steep as a stair, it looped backwards and forwards as it climbed. Up it horses could walk, and wains could be slowly hauled; but no enemy could come that way, except out of the air, if it was defended from above. At each turn of the road there were great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies. Some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes that still stared sadly at the passers-by. The Riders hardly glanced at them. The Púkel-men they called them, and heeded them little: no power or terror was left in them; but Merry gazed at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity, as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里不知道眼前究竟有多少的骠骑，在这一片黑暗中，他无法算清楚确切的数量，他只知道从对方的气势判断起来，至少有数千人。正当他在四下打量人数的时候，国王率领的部队来到了山谷东方的峭壁下，道路从这里突然开始往上攀爬，梅里惊讶地抬起头来。他所在的道路和他之前所见过的都不一样，这是远在历史记载、歌谣赞颂以前的人类所建造的，它不停地往上攀升，像是巨蛇一般蜿蜒，在陡峭的岩石间钻来钻去。马匹可以在上面前进，车辆也可以缓慢地拖拉上去，不过，除非敌人生出翅膀，否则是无法进攻此地的，因为，这里的防卫都是建造在上方的。在每一个道路转弯处，路旁都有一座巨大的雕像，这雕像描摹着手脚粗大的人类，每个都盘腿坐着，手臂放在肥胖的肚皮上。有些在岁月的磨蚀下变得完全无法辨认，只能够用两眼深深的凹洞忧伤地望着路过的旅人。骠骑们并不在乎这些雕像，他们都叫这些为普哥人，对它们视若无睹，在岁月的侵蚀之下，它们连一点威吓力都不剩。梅里则是用好奇的眼光打量着他们，同时又感觉到一丝丝的同情，这些雕像只能这样子动也不动地看着道路，直到永远。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the king's company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls of rock, and so went up a short slope and out on to a wide upland. The Firienfeld men called it, a green mountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep-delved courses of the Snowbourn, laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind: the Starkhorn southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of Írensaga, between which there faced the riders, the grim black wall of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted Mountain rising out of steep slopes of sombre pines. Dividing the upland into two there marched a double line of unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees. Those who dared to follow that road came soon to the black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and the menace of the pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door.</div>

He wondered what they could be, and he hoped that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond. Then he saw that there were clusters of tents and booths on either side of the stony way; but these were not set near the trees, and seemed rather to huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff. The greater number were on the right, where the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was a smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion.

Then the king followed with Éomer on his right. He had said farewell to Éowyn above in the Hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry rode on Stybba with the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king's household. They passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces. But when they had come almost to the end of the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit. A young man, Merry thought as he returned the glance, less in height and girth than most.

<div class="line_en">It was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras, although it was then but noon by the hour. There he halted only a short while and strengthened his host by some three score of Riders that came late to the weapontake. Now having eaten he made ready to set out again, and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell. But Merry begged for the last time not to be parted from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骠骑王的确是在如同黄昏一般的天色中来到伊多拉斯，只是，当时的时间其实已经接近中午了。他只在那里暂停了片刻，让将近百名迟来的骠骑和他们会合。在用过午餐之后，他准备再度出发，同时向他的随扈和蔼地道别。梅里再一次的恳求，希望不要和他分开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is no journey for such steeds as Stybba, as I have told you," said Théoden. "And in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of Gondor what would you do, Master Meriadoc, swordthain though you be, and greater of heart than of stature?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I received you for your safe-keeping," answered Théoden; "and also to do as I might bid. None of my Riders can bear you as burden. If the battle were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the minstrels; but it is a hundred leagues and two to Mundburg where Denethor is lord. I will say no more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我接受你的效忠是为了你的安全，”希优顿说：“同时也希望你能够服从我的命令。我麾下的骠骑都没办法承载你而又跟上队伍。如果这场战斗是在我的家门口发生，或许你可以名留青史，但这里距离迪耐瑟的王城三百零六哩之遥，不要再跟我争辩了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you indeed!" said Merry. "Thank you, sir, though I do not know your name."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then you shall go with me," said the Rider. "I will bear you before me, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骑士说：“那么你可以跟我走，我可以载你过去，在离开这附近之前，我可以用斗篷遮住你，而这黑暗会是我们最好的掩护。你最好不要拒绝我的好意，不要多说，只管来就对了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Merry bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of horsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening girths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit's ear. "Where will wants not, a way opens, so we say," he whispered; "and so I have found myself." Merry looked up and saw that it was the young Rider whom he had noticed in the morning. "You wish to go whither the Lord of the Mark goes: I see it in your face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里深深一鞠躬，闷闷不乐地转身走开，看着眼前的马队。队伍已经准备好要出发了，人们开始系紧腰带、检查马鞍、安抚马匹。有些人不安地看着逐渐降低的天空，一名骑士悄悄来到哈比人的身边，低语道：“我们的俗谚说，援手往往来自意料之外的地方，”他低语道：“我正准备伸出这样的援手。”梅里抬头一看，发现对方正是他早上所注意到的那名年轻人。“我看得出来，你希望和骠骑同进退。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you not?" said the Rider softly. "Then call me Dernhelm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，是吗？”骑士柔声说：“那就叫我德海姆好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus it came to pass that when the king set out, before Dernhelm sat Meriadoc the hobbit, and the great grey steed Windfola made little of the burden; for Dernhelm was less in weight than many men, though lithe and well-knit in frame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，当骠骑王出发的时候，哈比人梅里雅达克就坐在德海姆身前。两人胯下高大俊美的温佛拉对这多出的重量并不在乎，因为德海姆比大多数的男子要轻，但他也显得更为结实和敏捷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so King Théoden departed from his own realm, and mile by mile the long road wound away, and the beacon hills marched past: Calenhad, Min-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol. But their fires were quenched. All the lands were grey and still; and ever the shadow deepened before them, and hope waned in every heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">On into the shadow they rode. In the willow-thickets where Snowbourn flowed into Entwash, twelve leagues east of Edoras, they camped that night. And then on again through the Folde; and through the Fenmarch, where to their right great oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the hills under the shades of dark Halifirien by the borders of Gondor; but away to their left the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of Entwash. And as they rode rumour came of war in the North. Lone men, riding wild, brought word of foes assailing their east-borders, of orc-hosts marching in the Wold of Rohan.</div>
