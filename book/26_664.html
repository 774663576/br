<div class="line_en">I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful.</div>

<div class="line_en">I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark. I trembled lest they should see that they WERE so immensely more interesting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去我常想，我的两个学生怎么会猜测到我在想他们的怪事，实际上，这些怪事只会使人对他们更感兴趣，而不让他们了解这些对此事本身并没有直接帮助。我很焦虑，担心他们会明白，过去的他们比现在有趣得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我日复一日耐心地等待着，时间悄悄逝去，好像也带走了我些许的惊慌。实际上，我的学生们时常都在我的看管之下，也没有新的情况发生，这已足够让痛苦的幻想，甚至是可怕的记忆一笔勾销。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Putting things at the worst, at all events, as in meditation I so often did, any clouding of their innocence could only be -- blameless and foredoomed as they were -- a reason the more for taking risks. There were moments when, by an irresistible impulse, I found myself catching them up and pressing them to my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论怎样，在冥想时，我经常把事情往最坏处想，任何挡住他们清白的乌云——他们的命运都被提前安排，这也无可指责——都只是让我冒更多风险的原因。有时候，在无法抵抗的冲动下，我发现自己抓住他们，并把他们拥入怀里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a purpose in it.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged.</div>

<div class="line_en">It would have been easy to get into a sad, wild tangle about how much I might betray; but the real account, I feel, of the hours of peace that I could still enjoy was that the immediate charm of my companions was a beguilement still effective even under the shadow of the possibility that it was studied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于思量我泄露了多少秘密这件事，这很容易让我陷入悲伤、纠结的状态。但实际上，我仍能很安心平静地享受他们俩的魅力，即使这是有意的欺瞒，但它还是行之有效的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean -- though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most -- in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the "pieces" they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想，他们从没想过为他们可怜的女保护人做这么多的事，我是说，尽管他们的功课越来越出色，这自然最让她高兴了，尽管他们给她带来乐趣、愉悦、惊喜，读她布置的文章，讲她讲过的故事，看她的手势猜字谜，打扮成动物或历史人物偷袭她，最重要的是，大段地背诵他们偷偷用心记住的篇章，这让她目瞪口呆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I should never get to the bottom -- were I to let myself go even now -- of the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with which, in these days, I overscored their full hours. They had shown me from the first a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我永远也说不清楚这种奇妙的个人评述——即使现在我放开了自己。所有的一切都有待个人的考证，就这样，在这段日子，我寸步不离地看管着他们。从一开始，他们就向我展示出了他们对于一切事物的天赋——一种全方面的能力，从零开始，之后便能赢得辉煌的旅程。他们接受了他们的小任务，好像很喜欢的样子，并且凭借着惊人的天赋和良好的记忆力沉溺于其中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for Miles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这很容易让人联想起另一件相关的事，至今我仍对另一个不同的解释疑惑不已，我指的是我对于迈尔斯在那所学校发生的事情的异常镇定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Let me add that in their company now -- and I was careful almost never to be out of it -- I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想另外说明的是，和他们在一起时，我很小心，几乎从未心不在焉过，但却没有线索让我进一步了解。我们生活在一个由音乐、友爱、成就和私人话剧组成的幻境中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson's daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我只记得我当时并不满足于提出问题，满足感一定源于他不断表现出的异常聪慧。对于一个不称职的女家庭教师、一位牧师的女儿来说，他太过聪明了，不能被宠坏。我的印象中，他就是我刚提到的沉思构成的刺绣品上，最奇怪的（如果不是最耀眼的）线条，如果我敢说出来，那就是：一定有什么巨大的刺激影响和支配着他小小的思想生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to "come in" as something new.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教室的钢琴开始演奏出各种超凡的乐章。音乐结束之后，他们就又在角落里聊天，接着，其中一个孩子兴高采烈地走出去，由此进来的时候就可以摆一张新面孔了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had had brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我自己也有兄弟，可我不知道，原来一个小女孩可以成为小男孩顺从的仰慕者。超越一切的是，这世上居然有这样一个小男孩，他能替比他小、比他弱、没他聪明的人如此细心地考虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness. Sometimes, indeed, when I dropped into coarseness, I perhaps came across traces of little understandings between them by which one of them should keep me occupied while the other slipped away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们好得简直就像是一个人一样，如果我说从没吵过架或抱怨过彼此，这种对于他们可爱品质的表扬则显得有点儿低俗。的确，有的时候我会有点儿粗心，我可能会无意地发现他们之间的小协定，他们中的一个会吸引我的注意，而另一个则悄悄离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

I remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding's Amelia. also that I was wholly awake.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我那时的从容不迫看上去一定很了不起，如果有人在场，他们一定会崇拜我。我放下书本，站起来，拿着蜡烛，直接走到屋外，微弱的烛光照亮了过道，我轻轻地关上窗，锁好了门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of Flora's little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest. I recollect in short that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room.</div>

<div class="line_en">I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase.</div>

<div class="line_en">I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn't meet and measure him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我提到了先后顺序，但与昆特的第三次相遇使我惊呆了，时间仿佛都停滞了。这个幽灵已经移动到了楼梯的半腰处，离窗户最近的地方。他看到我，突然停下来，死死地盯着我，就像他在塔尖和花园里那样盯着我看。他知道我，就像我也知道他一样。因此，在寒冷的天气、微弱的晨光中，高窗玻璃闪着微光，下面的橡木楼梯也很光滑，我们都紧张地看着对方。在那一刻，他的出现无疑是真实、可怕而又邪恶的。但那不是惊异中的惊异，我把这样的殊荣赋予了另外一种情况：显然我已不再恐惧，我对他已充分了解，有准备对付他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The moment was so prolonged that it would have taken but little more to make me doubt if even I were in life. I can't express what followed it save by saying that the silence itself -- which was indeed in a manner an attestation of my strength -- became the element into which I saw the figure disappear; in which I definitely saw it turn as I might have seen the low wretch to which it had once belonged turn on receipt of an order, and pass, with my eyes on the villainous back that no hunch could have more disfigured, straight down the staircase and into the darkness in which the next bend was lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻是如此地漫长，如果再多持续一会儿，我都会怀疑我是否还是活着的。我无法说清接下来发生了什么，只有沉默本身——某种程度上它证明了我的勇气——它使我看到了那个幽灵的消失。我亲眼看到那个卑贱的人就像收到命令一样转身走了，看着他邪恶的背影，我想没有谁比他更丑恶了。他径直走下楼梯，消失在下一个拐角处的黑暗之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt, in a fierce rigor of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease -- for the time, at least -- to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous just because it WAS human, as human as to have met alone, in the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some criminal. It was the dead silence of our long gaze at such close quarters that gave the whole horror, huge as it was, its only note of the unnatural. If I had met a murderer in such a place and at such an hour, we still at least would have spoken. Something would have passed, in life, between us; if nothing had passed, one of us would have moved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得，在极其自信的情况下，如果我能站一会儿，我就能阻止他——至少在那一次，让他有所顾虑。因此，在那一刻，这件事既人性又可怕，就像一个访谈：可怕是因为他是人，作为一个人，在凌晨一间静谧的屋里和某个敌人、冒险家、罪犯单独相遇。我们长时间近距离地盯着对方看，死一般宁静，非常可怕，也很不自然。如果我在此时此地遇到的是一个杀人犯，我们至少还可以说话。生命中有某种东西从我们之间流过；如果没有流过，我们中的一个肯定会行动。">查看中文翻译</div>
