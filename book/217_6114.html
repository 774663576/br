<div class="line_en">We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says: "Who dah?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沿着树丛中小道，踮着脚丫，朝寡妇园子尽头往回走，一路上弯下身子，免得树杈子划破脑袋。我们走过厨房时，我被树根绊了一跤，发出了响声。我们伏下不动。华珍小姐的那个大个儿的名叫杰姆的黑奴，正坐在厨房门口。我们看得清清楚楚，因为他身后有灯光。只见他站起身来，把颈子往前探，侧耳听了一会儿。接着说，“谁呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back, right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepy-if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim says:</div>

<div class="line_en">So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching under -- neath. I didn't know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore -- and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，他坐在地上，就在我和汤姆的中间，他背贴着一棵树，两脚向前伸开，一条腿几乎碰到了我的一条腿。我的鼻子开始发痒，痒得我的眼泪都直淌下来，不过我仍然没有抓。接着，我鼻腔里也痒了起来，然后是鼻子底下。我真不知道怎样才能这么坐着一动也不动。这么长时间难受的罪啊，一直持续了有五六分钟之久，不过在感觉上觉得不止痒。接着，我估摸着，我浑身有十一处在发痒。再坚持一分钟以上，我可就要顶不住啦。不过，我还是咬咬牙，准备再顶一顶。就在这个时刻，杰姆呼吸变粗了，又过一会儿，他打起鼾来了这样，我就马上又舒坦起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom he made a sign to me-kind of a little noise with his mouth-and we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆呢，他给了我一个信号嘴里发出一点声响，我们就手脚并用爬过去。爬了几步远，汤姆在我耳边低声说，为了这样好玩儿，他要把杰姆捆绑在一棵树上。我说不行，这样会弄醒他，就会闹腾起来，人家就会发现我不在屋里。接着，汤姆说蜡烛不够用，他想溜进厨房去多带几根蜡烛。我劝他别这么干，因为说不定他会醒，会跟着来。可汤姆却要冒一冒险，我们溜了进去，取了四支蜡烛，汤姆在桌上留下了八分钱，算是蜡烛钱。然后，我们出了厨房。我想快点溜走，可是怎么也阻止不了汤姆，他非要手脚并用爬到杰姆那边，跟他开个玩笑。我只得等着，仿佛等了很久，周围一片寂静，使人感觉很孤单。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things, Jim would happen in and say, "Hm! What you know 'bout witches?" and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five -- center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆一回来，我们就顺着园子的围墙，沿着小径向前走，一步步摸上了屋那头陡峭的小山顶。汤姆说他把杰姆的帽子从头上轻轻摘了下来，挂在他头顶上一根矮树杈上。杰姆身子虽然动了一下，不过幸亏没醒。这件事过后，杰姆对人说，妖巫在他身上施了魔法，弄得他神志昏迷，然后骑着他飞往本州各地，然后把他降落到原来那棵树下，并且把他的帽子挂在枝杈上，好让他知道这到底是谁干的。到下一回，杰姆逢人便说，他被一直骑到了新奥尔良。再后来，每次对人家吹起来，地界越吹越广。最后，他告人说，他们骑在他身上走遍了全世界，搞得他几乎累得半死，他背上也长满了马鞍子磨破了的泡泡。杰姆对这一回的经过，高兴得忘乎所以，甚至为此不把别的黑奴放在眼里。各地的黑奴从遥远的地方来听杰姆讲述这种种经过，这样他成了这一方黑奴中间最受欢迎的人。外地来的黑奴嘴巴张得大大的，上上下下打量他，仿佛见到了珍奇宝贝。黑奴一般喜欢讲黑地里。灶火边，妖巫怎么样怎么样。不过，逢到有人这么讲，便显得自己在这方面无所不知，无所不通。杰姆总会插一句，说一声，“哼！你懂得什么‘妖巫，？”那个黑奴就被封住嘴，不得不往后靠了。杰姆总是把那个五分钱的角子用细绳栓在颈子上，说这是那个妖巫亲手给他的一种法宝，还亲口告诉他这能治一切疑难病症，并且说只要念咒语可以随时把妖巫招请来，不过妖巫告诉他念的那些词，他可从未对人讲过。黑奴从四面八方来，还给杰姆带来他们所尽有的礼品。他们的目的只是为了能见识一下那个五分钱的钱币。不过他们不敢摸钱币一下，因为这是魔鬼的手摸过了的。作为一个仆人，杰姆这下子可糟了，因为他既然见过魔鬼，又被妖巫骑在身上过，他就很自然地神气起来，目中无人了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.</div>

<div class="line_en">We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:</div>

And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.</div>

Don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do? Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就只是因为书上没有这样写这就是原由所在。朋。罗杰斯，我问你，你是愿意照规矩办事，还是不愿意？问题恰恰出在这里。你以为，写书的人不知道什么才是正确的办法么？你自以为比他们更高明？才不呢！先生，不，我们还是要按照以往的规矩勒索赎金。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it. Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won't be no place for the rob -- bers. But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that.
