<div class="line_en">I woke up to find the doctor lifting me very carefully into my own bed. It was good to be back in my familiar bedroom, with a warm fire and candle-light. It was also a great relief to recognize Dr Lloyd, who Mrs Reed called in for her servants (she always called a specialist for herself and the children). He was looking after me so kindly. I felt he would protect me from Mrs Reed. He talked to me a little, then gave Bessie orders to take good care of me. When he left, I felt very lonely again.</div>

I knew I had no one to love me and nothing to look forward to.</div>

<div class="line_en">I heard later from the servants that he had spoken to Mrs Reed about me, and that she had agreed immediately to send me to school. Abbott said Mrs Reed would be glad to get rid of me. In this conversation I also learned for the first time that my father had been a poor vicar. When he married my mother, Miss Jane Reed of Gateshead, the Reed family were so angry that they disinherited her. I also heard that my parents both died of an illness only a year after their wedding.</div>

When she was kind to me I thought she was the best person in the world, but she did not always have time for me.</div>

I knew Mrs Reed would be there too and I was frightened of seeing her again. When I nervously entered the breakfast-room I looked up at a black column! At least that was what he looked like to me. He was a tall, thin man dressed all in black, with a cold, stony face at the top of the column.</div>
