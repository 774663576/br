<div class="line_en">Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow. In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving, in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her affection.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration of their opinions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺对他们的相恋并不感到意外。她只希望他们不要搞得太露骨，曾有一两次冒昧地建议玛丽安还是克制点为好。玛丽安讨厌遮遮掩掩的，觉得纵情任性不会真正丧失体面，克制感情本身就不值得称道。在她看来，这不仅没有必要，而且是理智对陈腐错误观念的可耻屈从。威洛比也有同感，他们的行为始终可以说明他们的观点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he did, was right. Every thing he said, was clever. If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要威洛比在场，玛丽安便目无他顾。他做的每件事都很正确，说的每句话都很高明。如果庄园里的晚会最后以打牌结束，那么他就会竭尽作弊之能事，宁肯牺牲自己和其他人也要给她凑一手好牌。如果当晚的主要活动是跳舞，那么他们有一半时间是在一起跳。万不得已给拆散一两次，也要尽量挨在一起，两人跟别人连一句话都不说。这种行为自然会让众人嗤笑不已，但是嗤笑并不能使他们感到难为情，也似乎并不惹得他们恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达什伍德太太完全体谅他们的心情，她只觉得心里热呼呼的，哪里还顾得上阻止他们感情的过于外露。在她看来，这仅仅是热情奔放的年轻人倾心相爱的必然表现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是玛丽安的幸福时刻。她把心献给了威洛比。她从苏塞克斯来到这里时，还对诺兰庄园满怀深情，认为这种感情什么时候也不会淡薄。可是如今，威洛比的到来给她现在的家带来了魅力，她对诺兰庄园的一片深情就有可能淡薄下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor's happiness was not so great. Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home; -- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺倒不感到这么幸福。她的心里并不那么安宁，对于各项娱乐并不那么真心欢喜，因为这些娱乐既不能为她提供一个伙伴，借以代替她撇在诺兰庄园的那个人，又不能开导她减少对诺兰庄园的思恋哀惜之情。无论米德尔顿夫人还是詹宁斯太太，都不能为她提供她所留恋的那种谈话，尽管后者是个喋喋不休的健谈家，并且从一开始就很优待她，使她得以较多地聆听她的谈论。她已经早把自己的履历向埃丽诺反复讲了三四遍。埃丽诺只要没有白长这么大，记性还可以的话，她或许早在她们刚认识时，就了解到詹宁斯先生最后一场病的详细情况，以及他临终前几分钟对他太太说了些什么话。如果说米德尔顿夫人比她母亲令人合意些，那只是在于她比较少言寡语。埃丽诺不用仔细观察就能发现，她之所以少言寡语，只是因为她性情稳静，和理智毫无关系。她对她丈夫、母亲和别人一样，都是这副样子，因此不能企望她会亲密一些。她除了重复前一天说过的话之外，别无他言。她的漠然寡趣是无可改变的，因为即使她的心情也总是一成不变的。对于丈夫安排的各种聚会，只要一切都办得体面气派，两个大孩子又能跟着她，她也并不表示反对。但是，她似乎从来不显得比坐在家里快乐些。她虽然也出席，但从不介入众人的交谈，因而不能给别人增添乐趣，有时只有当她关照那些调皮捣蛋的孩子时，才知道她在场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion. Willoughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺觉得，在她新结识的人里，唯有布兰登上校堪称具有一定的才干，能激起友谊的兴致，带来交往的乐趣。威洛比可就谈不上啦。尽管她爱慕他，敬重他，甚至姐妹般地敬重他，可他毕竟处在热恋之中，只知道向玛丽安献殷勤。也许，他若是少献点殷勤，倒会更讨众人喜欢些。布兰登上校很是不幸，他本想倾心于玛丽安，玛丽安对他却无情意，冷若冰霜。不过，通过与埃丽诺进行交谈，他得到了最大的安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him. This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes were fixed on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint smile, "Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second attachments."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺越来越同情上校，因为她有理由猜想，他已经感到了失恋的痛苦。这种猜想是一天晚上在巴顿庄园听他无意中漏出一句话而引起来的。当时，别人都在跳舞，他俩经过彼此同意，一道坐了下来。上校两眼凝视着玛丽安，沉默了几分钟之后，淡然微笑着说：“据我了解，你妹妹不赞成第二次爱情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看她是这样认为的。但是，我不晓得她怎么能这样想，这岂不有损于她自己父亲的人格，因为他就有过两个妻子。不过，再过几年，她就会根据自己的常识和观察，把看法变得合情合理一些。到那时候，她的观点在除她以外的任何人看来，都会比现在更容易解释，更容易辩护。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This will probably be the case," he replied; "and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“情况可能如此，”上校答道，“然而青年人的偏见别有一番亲切感，谁肯忍心抛弃，而去接受那些比较一般的观点？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I cannot agree with you there," said Elinor. "There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这一点上我不能同意你的看法，”埃丽诺说，“玛丽安这样的观点带有种种不宜之处，任凭世人的狂热和无知有多大魅力，也将于事无补。不幸的是，她的思想严重倾向于蔑视礼仪。我期望她能进一步认识世界，这可能给她带来极大的好处。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你妹妹是不是不加区别地一概反对第二次恋爱？难道每个人这样做都同样有罪吗？难道凡是第一次选择失当的人，无论因为对象朝三暮四，还是因为情况违逆多舛，就该一辈子漠然处之？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This," said he, "cannot hold; but a change, a total change of sentiments-No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced change-from a series of unfortunate circumstances" -- Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head. The lady would probably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. As it was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这种看法，”上校说，“是不会持久的。感情上的变化，感情上的彻底变化——不，不，不要痴心妄想了，因为青年人富于幻想，一旦被迫改变主意，代之而来的总是些平庸不堪、危险之极的观点！我这样说是有切身体验的。我从前认识一位女子，她在性情和心地上很像你妹妹，像她那样思考问题，判断是非，但是她被迫改变了—一是让一系列不幸事件逼迫的——，”说到这里，他蓦地顿住了，似乎觉得自己说得太多了。看他那脸色，埃丽诺不禁起了猜疑。她看得出来，他不想提起与那女子有关的事情，要不然，这女子不会引起她的疑心。其实，事情不难想象，他之所以如此动情，定与想起过去的隐衷有关。埃丽诺没去多想。不过，若是换成玛丽安，却不会想得这么少。她凭着活跃的想象，很快就会把整个故事构思出来，一切都会被纳入一场爱情悲剧的框框，令人忧伤至极。">查看中文翻译</div>
