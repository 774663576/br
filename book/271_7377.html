<div class="line_en">The wedding flowed into the reception party smoothly -- proof of Alice's flawless planning. It was just twilight over the river; the ceremony had lasted exactly the right amount of time, allowing the sun to set behind the trees. The lights in the trees glimmered as Edward led me through the glass back doors, making the white flowers glow. There were another ten thousand flowers out here, serving as a fragrant, airy tent over the dance floor set up on the grass under two of the ancient cedars.</div>

<div class="line_en">Things slowed down, relaxed as the mellow August evening surrounded us. The little crowd spread out under the soft shine of the twinkle lights, and we were greeted again by the friends we'd just embraced. There was time to talk now, to laugh.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Congrats, guys," Seth Clearwater told us, ducking his head under the edge of a flower garland. His mother, Sue, was tight by his side, eyeing the guests with wary intensity. Her face was thin and fierce, an expression that was accented by her short, severe hairstyle; it was as short as her daughter Leah's -- I wondered if she'd cut it the same way in a show of solidarity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恭喜你们啊，”塞思·克里尔沃特对我们说，一边还把花环扣在了头上。他的母亲，苏，紧跟在他身边，她小心谨慎地看着来宾。她的脸干瘦而又凶相，和她女儿利亚一样的精悍短发，加剧了凝重的表情。我怀疑她的头发是不是和她女儿一起在誓师大会一起理的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I looked at Jacob's father, I always felt like I was seeing two people rather than just one. There was the old man in the wheelchair with the lined face and the white smile that everyone else saw. And then there was the direct descendant of a long line of powerful, magical chieftains, cloaked in the authority he'd been born with. Though the magic had -- in the absence of a catalyst -- skipped his generation, Billy was still a part of the power and the legend. It flowed straight through him. It flowed to his son, the heir to the magic, who had turned his back on it. That left Sam Uley to act as the chief of legends and magic now…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我看着雅各布的父亲，总有种错觉我能看到两个人的影子而不是一个。这个坐在轮椅上的老人，脸上满是皱纹，惨白的笑容每个人都能看到。作为长久以来强大、具有神奇力量的首领的世袭者，他与生俱来就被赋予了这样一种权威。虽然这个魔法由于缺少催化剂的作用在他身上无法显现，Billy仍然被视作权威的象征和传奇人物。这份神力流传到他的身上，也同样流传到了他儿子的身上，但后者却放弃了这样的权利、地位。甘愿让山姆·乌利 成为这一传奇和神力的领袖……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Billy seemed oddly at ease considering the company and the event -- his black eyes sparkled like he'd just gotten some good news. I was impressed by his composure. This wedding must have seemed a very bad thing, the worst thing that could happen to his best friend's daughter, in Billy's eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这样的晚会和这样的人群中，比利显得异常放松。他黑色的眼珠子神采奕奕，好像刚得来什么好消息。他的这份淡定给我留下了深刻的印象。本来在比利眼中，这场婚礼应该是件极为糟糕的事情，发生在他朋友的女儿身上最糟的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew it wasn't easy for him to restrain his feelings, considering the challenge this event foreshadowed to the ancient treaty between the Cullens and the Quileutes -- the treaty that prohibited the Cullens from ever creating another vampire. The wolves knew a breach was coming, but the Cullens had no idea how they would react. Before the alliance, it would have meant an immediate attack. A war. But now that they knew each other better, would there be forgiveness instead?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道要完全不产生抵触情绪并不是件容易的事情，尤其这场晚会还有更深的涵——挑战卡伦家族和奎鲁特部落达成的古老条约，条约禁止卡伦家族制造其他吸血鬼。狼人们知道违背约定的那一天就要来临，而同时卡伦家族也不知道他们会有什么反应。在结盟之前，这无疑会触发一轮攻击，一场大战。但是现在，他们更了解对方了，那会不会获得原谅？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind my human friends were my new cousins-in-law, the Denali vampire clan. I realized I was holding my breath as the vampire in front -- Tanya, I assumed from the strawberry tint in her blond curls -- reached out to embrace Edward. Next to her, three other vampires with golden eyes stared at me with open curiosity. One woman had long, pale blond hair, straight as corn silk. The other woman and the man beside her were both black-haired, with a hint of an olive tone to their chalky complexions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧接着我人类朋友们后面的是我新的堂兄弟，来自德纳里峰的吸血鬼家族。我屏住呼吸，看到站在最前面的吸血鬼——坦尼娅，金色卷发中挑染了莓红，我从这一点上认出了她。她伸出手去拥抱爱德华。在她后面的另外三个吸血鬼都用他们金色的眼睛盯着我看，丝毫不掩饰他们的好奇。其中一个女子有一头像蚕丝般长长的，浅金色直发。她身边的另一名女子和男子都是黑发，使他们苍白的肌肤略显橄榄棕的色调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“容我给你介绍我的妻子。”这是第一次爱德华如此正式地说出这个字眼；而且看起来他说到这个单词时已经一副开心到要爆了的样子。惹得德纳里峰家族的人一阵轻笑。“坦尼娅，这位是我的贝拉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the standard traditions were kept. I was blinded by flashbulbs as we held the knife over a spectacular cake -- too grand, I thought, for our relatively intimate group of friends and family. We took turns shoving cake in each other's faces; Edward manfully swallowed his portion as I watched in disbelief. I threw my bouquet with atypical skill, right into Angela's surprised hands. Emmett and Jasper howled with laughter at my blush while Edward removed my borrowed garter -- which I'd shimmied down nearly to my ankle -- very carefully with his teeth. With a quick wink at me, he shot it straight into Mike Newton's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有标准的传统流程都被保留了下来。当我俩手执一把刀切下壮观的大蛋糕时，我都快被闪光灯给照瞎了。说蛋糕壮观，是因为它过于巨大了，远远超过我们朋友和家人所需的份额。于是我们开始轮流将蛋糕扣在别人脸上；我还难以置信地看到爱德华非常具有男子气魄地将他那份蛋糕给吞了下去。我用不标准的姿势直接将捧花扔进了安吉拉惊讶的手中。我借来的吊带袜不知何时已经垮到了脚踝，爱德华仔细地用他的利牙帮我去掉了它。就在他帮我移除吊带的时候，埃米特和贾斯帕起哄地笑声又一次让我涨红了脸。爱德华朝我飞快地使了个眼色，他将弹力带直接射向了迈克·牛顿的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
