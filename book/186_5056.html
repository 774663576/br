<div class="line_en">"Ho! Her-ipress, are you? We'll see about that," said a voice. Then another voice said, "Three cheers for the Hempress of Colney 'Atch" and quite a number joined in. A flush of colour came into the Witch's face and she bowed ever so slightly. But the cheers died away into roars of laughter and she saw that they had only been making fun of her: A change came over her expression and she changed the knife to her left hand. Then, without warning, she did a thing that was dreadful to see. Lightly, easily, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world, she stretched up her right arm and wrenched off one of the cross-bars of the lamp-post. If she had lost some magical powers in our world, she had not lost her strength; she could break an iron bar as if it were a stick of barleysugar. She tossed her new weapon up in the air, caught it again, brandished it, and urged the horse forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now's my chance," thought Digory. He darted between the horse and the railings and began going forward. If only the brute would stay still for a moment he might catch the Witch's heel. As he rushed, he heard a sickening crash and a thud. The Witch had brought the bar down on the chief policeman's helmet: the man fell like a nine-pin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的机会来了。”迪格雷想。他突然奔到马和围栏之间，接着继续向前跑，开始寻机靠近女巫。只要那牲口停一秒钟，他都能抓住女巫的脚跟。正当他往前冲时，他听到一阵咣当当的重击声。原来，女巫的铁棒敲在了那个警官的头盔上，他歪歪斜斜地倒了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowd booed and bellowed again. A stone whistled over Digory's head. Then came the voice of the Witch, clear like a great bell, and sounding as if, for once, she were almost happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a second crash and another policeman crumpled up. There came an angry roar from the crowd: "Pull her down. Get a few paving-stones. Call out the Military." But most of them were getting as far away as they could. The Cabby, however, obviously the bravest as well as the kindest person present, was keeping close to the horse, dodging this way and that to avoid the bar, but still trying to catch Strawberry's head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Digory as last caught her ankle. She kicked back with her heel and hit him in the mouth. In his pain he lost hold. His lip was cut and his mouth full of blood. From somewhere very close by came the voice of Uncle Andrew in a sort of trembling scream. "Madam -- my dear young lady -- for heaven's sake -- compose yourself." Digory made a second grab at her heel, and was again shaken off. More men were knocked down by the iron bar. He made a third grab: caught the heel: held on tike grim death, shouting to Polly "Go!" then Oh, thank goodness. The angry, frightened faces had vanished. The angry, frightened voices were silenced. All except Uncle Andrew's. Close beside Digory in the darkness, it was wailing on "Oh, oh, is this delirium? Is it the end? I can't bear it. It's not fair. I never meant to be a Magician. It's all a misunderstanding. It's all my godmother's fault; I must protest against this. In my state of health too. A very old Dorsetshire family."</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the Witch saw that she was once more in the wood she turned pale and bent down till her face touched the mane of the horse. You could see she felt deadly sick. Uncle Andrew was shivering. But Strawberry, the horse, shook his head, gave a cheerful whinny, and seemed to feel better. He became quiet for the first time since Digory had seen him. His ears, which had been laid flat back on his skull, came into their proper position, and the fire went out of his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女巫一看自己又到了那片树林，脸刷地白了，腰慢慢地弯下来，直到脸贴着马的鬃毛。看得出，她极为难妥。安德鲁舅舅在发抖。但“草莓”，那匹马，却摇摇头，快活地低低嘶叫了一声，似乎觉得奸些了。自从迪格雷看见它以来，它还是第一次这么安静。先前一直贴在脑袋上的耳朵现在恢复了正常的位置，眼睛也有了神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not," began Digory, but before he could say anything more, their heads came out into the warm, green sunshine of the wood. And as they stepped out of the pool Polly cried out:</div>

Digory was still holding the Witch's heel and Polly was holding Digory's hand. One of the Cabby's hands was on Strawberry; and Uncle Andrew, still very shaky, had just grabbed on the Cabby's other hand.</div>

It was so dark that they couldn't see one another at all and it made no difference whether you kept your eyes shut or open.

<div class="line_en">"Now then, now then," came the Cabby's voice, a good firm, hardy voice. "Keep cool everyone, that's what I say. No bones broken, anyone? Good. Well there's something to be thankful for straight away, and more than anyone could expect after falling all that way. Now, if we've fallen down some diggings -- as it might be for a new station on the Underground -- someone will come and get us out presently, see! And if we're dead -- which I don't deny it might be -- well, you got to remember that worse things 'appen at sea and a chap's got to die sometime. And there ain't nothing to be afraid of if a chap's led a decent life. And if you ask me, I think the best thing we could do to pass the time would be sing a 'ymn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，喂，”马车夫有一副好嗓子，他用坚强的口吻说，“我想说，大家都冷静下来。没有人摔断骨头，是吧，好。实在应该感到欣慰。像这样摔下来，结果比任何人估计的都要好。假如我们是掉进了一些房屋里——例如地铁的一个新站头——很快就会有人把我们救出去的，对不对！要是我们死了——我不否认有这种可能——那么，你们该记得有时海上会发生比这更坏的事，总有人要死的。如果一个人曾经体面地生活过，便没什么可怕的。你们如果问我，我想，我们打发时间的最好办法就是唱一首圣歌。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he did. He struck up at once a harvest thanksgiving hymn, all about crops being "safely gathered in". It was not very suitable to a place which felt as if nothing had ever grown there since the beginning of time, but it was the one he could remember best. He had a fine voice and the children joined in; it was very cheering. Uncle Andrew and the Witch did not join in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他马上就唱起了一首收获时节感恩的圣歌，唱的是庄稼被“圆满地收创归仓”。在一个似乎从一开始就没有牛长过东西的地方唱这种歌并不十分合适，但这是他记得最清楚的一首歌。他的音色优美，孩子们也跟着唱了起来。气氛欢畅愉快。安德鲁舅舅和女巫没有加入进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Towards the end of the hymn Digory felt someone plucking at his elbow and from a general smell of brandy and cigars and good clothes he decided that it must be Uncle Andrew. Uncle Andrew was cautiously pulling him away from the others. When they had gone a little distance, the old man put his mouth so close to Digory's ear that it tickled, and whispered:</div>

<div class="line_en">In the darkness something was happening at last. A voice had begun to sing. It was very far away and Digory found it hard to decide from what direction it was coming. Sometimes it seemed to come from all directions at once. Sometimes he almost thought it was coming out of the earth beneath them. Its lower notes were deep enough to be the voice of the earth herself. There were no words. There was hardly even a tune. But it was, beyond comparison, the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. It was so beautiful he could hardly bear it. The horse seemed to like it too; he gave the sort of whinney a horse would give if, after years of being a cab-horse, it found itself back in the old field where it had played as a foal, and saw someone whom it remembered and loved coming across the field to bring it a lump of sugar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗中终干有了动静。远方，一个声音开始歌唱。迪格雷分辨不清在哪个方向。有时，声音似乎从四面八方同时传过来，有时又好像就在他们的脚下。这声音低沉得犹如大地发出的声音。没有歌词，也没有旋律，却是迪格雷听到过的最美妙的声音。那声音如此动人，使他难以忍受。那匹马似乎也喜欢；它低低地嘶叫着，仿佛拉了多年的车以后．又回到了童年时代嬉戏的故乡，看见所记得和所爱的人拿着糖块，穿过田野向它走来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“夭哪，”马车夫说，“真好听啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then two wonders happened at the same moment. One was that the voice was suddenly joined by other voices; more voices than you could possibly count. They were in harmony with it, but far higher up the scale: cold, tingling, silvery voices. The second wonder was that the blackness overhead, all at once, was blazing with stars. They didn't come out gently one by one, as they do on a summer evening. One moment there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of light leaped out -- single stars, constellations, and planets, brighter and bigger than any in our world. There were no clouds. The new stars and the new voices began at exactly the same time. If you had seen and heard it, as Digory did, you would have felt quite certain that it was the stars themselves which were singing, and that it was the First Voice, the deep one, which had made them appear and made them sing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻，两个奇迹同时发生了。一个是，突然间，数不清的冷峻、战栗、银铃般的声音掺合到那个声音之中，与之和谐地组合在一起，但音量却高得多。第二个是，头上的黑暗中突然群早闪烁。不是夏夜中一颗接一颗悄悄出现的星星，而是在一团漆黑之中，霎时问跳跃出的成千上万颗恒星、星丛和行星，比我们世界里看到的要大得多、亮得多。没有一朵云。新的星星和新的声音同时出现。如果你像迪格雷一样亲眼看见和亲耳听见的话，你会相当肯定地觉得是腥星自己在唱歌，而唤出它们并使它们歌唱的是那低沉的第一个声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was soon light enough for them to see one another's faces. The Cabby and the two children had open mouths and shining eyes; they were drinking in the sound, and they looked as if it reminded them of something. Uncle Andrew's mouth was open too, but not open with joy. He looked more as if his chin had simply dropped away from the rest of his face. His shoulders were stopped and his knees shook. He was not liking the Voice. If he could have got away from it by creeping into a rat's hole, he would have done so. But the Witch looked as if, in a way, she understood the music better than any of them. Her mouth was shut, her lips were pressed together, and her fists were clenched. Ever since the song began she had felt that this whole world was filled with a Magic different from hers and stronger. She hated it. She would have smashed that whole world, or all worlds, to pieces, if it would only stop the singing. The horse stood with its ears well forward, and twitching. Every now and then it snorted and stamped the ground. It no longer looked like a tired old cab-horse; you could now well believe that its father had been in battles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，天色已经亮得使他们能互相看见对方的脸了。马车夫和两个孩子张着嘴，目光闪烁，陶醉在美妙的声音之中；那声音仿佛使他们想起了什么。安德鲁舅舅也张着嘴，但不是出于高兴；他看上去更像是失去了下巴。他身子弓着，膝盖在发抖。他不喜欢那种声音。如果可以钻进老鼠洞来逃避的话，他会那么做的。女巫看上去似乎比任何人都更能理解那种音乐。她嘴唇紧闭，捏着拳头。歌唱刚开始的时候，她就感到，这个世界笼罩着一种与她的魔力不相同但强大得多的魔力。她恨它。她会把这个世界以至所有的世界都撕成碎片，只要能够阻止那种声音。马站在那里，耳朵前倾并不断地抽动，还时不时用蹄子敲打地面或者打几声响鼻。它看上去不再是一匹劳累不堪的拉车老马，你现在完全可以相信它的父亲当过战马。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Far away, and down near the horizon, the sky began to turn grey. A light wind, very fresh, began to stir. The sky, in that one place, grew slowly and steadily paler. You could see shapes of hills standing up dark against it. All the time the Voice went on singing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Digory had never seen such a sun. The sun above the ruins of Charn had looked older than ours: this looked younger. You could imagine that it laughed for joy as it came up. And as its beams shot across the land the travellers could see for the first time what sort of place they were in. It was a valley through which a broad, swift river wound its way, flowing eastward towards the sun. Southward there were mountains, northward there were lower hills. But it was a valley of mere earth, rock and water; there was not a tree, not a bush, not a blade of grass to be seen. The earth was of many colours: they were fresh, hot and vivid. They made you feel excited; until you saw the Singer himself, and then you forgot everything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪格雷从未见过这样的太阳。恰恩废墟上空的太阳看上去比我们的太阳老，这轮太阳却显得比我们的太阳年轻些。你可以想像，它是高兴地笑着升起来的。当阳光四射、照亮大地的时候，这一群人第一次看清自己站的地方。那是一片谷地，一条水流平缓的大河穿越其间，朝着太阳升起的东方奔涌而去。南边有大山，北边有丘陵。河谷里只有岩石、土和水，没有树和灌木，连一片草叶也没有。泥土是五颜六色的，新鲜、温热，艳丽夺目，令人激动。当你亲眼看见歌唱者时，你便忘了其他的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The eastern sky changed from white to pink and from pink to gold. The Voice rose and rose, till all the air was shaking with it. And just as it swelled to the mightiest and most glorious sound it had yet produced, the sun arose.</div>
