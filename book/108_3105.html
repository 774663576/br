<div class="line_en">A half-dozen times Ove woke up in the night when the cat, with more than a little disrespect, crawled up and stretched out next to him in the bed. And just as many times the cat woke up when Ove, with more than a bit of brusqueness, booted it down to the floor again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove spent most of yesterday shouting at Parvaneh that this damned cat would live in Ove's house over his dead body.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, when it's gone quarter to six and Ove has got up, the cat is sitting in the middle of the kitchen floor. It sports a disgruntled expression, as if Ove owes it money. Ove stares back at it with a suspicion normally reserved for a cat that has rung his doorbell with a Bible in its paws, like a Jehovah's Witness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，六点不到一刻钟，欧维起床，看到猫坐在厨房中央，一脸欧维欠钱的表情。欧维同样怀疑地瞪着猫，就像猫刚摁了他的门铃，爪子下面还按着一本圣经，对欧维说“准备迎接耶稣的到来”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat doesn't answer. It just nibbles its remaining patches of fur and nonchalantly licks one of its paw pads.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're only here because I couldn't talk any sense into that pregnant woman." He nods across the living room towards the window facing onto Parvaneh's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在这儿，只是因为那个孕妇无理取闹。”欧维穿过客厅，朝着窗户冲帕尔瓦娜家点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not running a cat repair company," Ove clarifies to the cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不是什么猫咪修理厂。”欧维向猫咪声明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove goes to the sink. Turns on the coffeemaker. Checks his watch. Looks at the cat. After leaving Jimmy at the hospital, Parvaneh had managed to get hold of a friend who was apparently a veterinarian. The veterinarian had come to have a look at the cat and concluded that there was "serious frostbite and advanced malnutrition." And then he'd given Ove a long list of instructions about what the cat needed to eat and its general care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维站在厨房操作台前，煮上咖啡，看看钟，看看猫。离开医院之后，帕尔瓦娜连夜找了个做兽医的熟人。兽医将其诊断为“严重冻伤和营养不良”。然后他给欧维开了一长串注意事项：要吃点什么以及怎么照顾，仿佛这猫是个沙发，而欧维就是猫咪修理厂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat, busying itself trying to lick one of its eyes, does not reply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫看上去正忙着努力舔自己的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove holds up four little socks towards it. He was given them by the veterinarian. Apparently the Cat Annoyance needs exercise more than anything, and this is something Ove feels he may be able to help it achieve. The farther from his wallpaper those claws are, the better. That's Ove's reasoning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维冲它举起四个小袜子——兽医给他的。猫崽子最需要的显然是运动，实际上，欧维觉得这他倒可以帮上忙。他寻思，只要能让爪子们远离欧维的墙纸，越久越好。这就是欧维的理由。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hop into these things and then we can go. I'm running late!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“穿上，我们好出门。已经迟到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove makes an extra loop to the end of the pathway. Outside Anita and Rune's house he picks up a cigarette butt. He rolls it between his fingers. That Škoda-driving man from the council seems to drive about in these parts as if he owned them. Ove swears and puts the butt in his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维到街尽头多转了一圈。在安妮塔和鲁尼的家门口，他捡起一截烟头。他在指尖把它翻来调去。那个开斯柯达的公务员开着车在社区里乱转，就好像这儿是他的地盘。欧维咒骂一声把烟头塞进口袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat gets up elaborately and walks with long, self-conscious steps towards the door. As if walking on a red carpet. It gives the socks an initial skeptical look, but doesn't cause too much of a fuss when Ove quite roughly puts them on. When he's done, Ove stands up and scrutinizes the cat from top to bottom. Shakes his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫咪磨磨叽叽地站起身，迈着扭捏的大方步向门口走，就像在走红地毯。一开始它对袜子有些迟疑，但欧维粗暴地给它的每只爪子套上去的时候，也没有遭遇不必要的反抗。套完袜子，欧维站直身子，上下打量。他摇摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A cat wearing socks -- it can't be natural. The cat, now standing there checking out its new outfit, suddenly looks immeasurably pleased with itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿袜子的猫，这怎么可能自然。猫咪自己站在那儿，好奇地端详着自己的新扮相，反倒突然洋洋自得起来">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they get back to the house, Ove reluctantly feeds the wretched animal, and once it's finished, announces that they've got errands to run. He may have been temporarily press-ganged into cohabiting with this little creature, but he'll be damned if he's going to leave a wild animal on its own in his house. So the cat has to come with him. Immediately there's a disagreement between Ove and the cat about whether or not the cat should sit on a sheet of newspaper in the Saab's passenger seat. At first Ove sets the cat on two supplements of entertainment news, which the cat, much insulted, kicks onto the floor with its back feet. It makes itself comfortable on the soft upholstery. At this Ove firmly picks up the cat by the scruff of its neck, so that the cat hisses at him in a not-so-passive-aggressive manner, while Ove shoves three cultural supplements and book reviews under him. The cat gives him a furious look. Ove puts it down, but oddly enough it stays on the newspaper and only looks out of the window with a wounded, dismal expression. Ove concludes that he's won the battle, nods with satisfaction, puts the Saab into gear, and drives onto the main road. Only then does the cat slowly and deliberately drag its claws in a long tear across the newsprint, and then put both its front paws through the rip. While at the same time giving Ove a highly challenging look, as if to ask: "And what are you going to do about it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们回到家里，欧维不情愿地喂这只可怜的动物，当它吃完后，欧维表示有差事要办。对欧维来说，他可能是被迫暂时和这只小妖孽同居的，但他可不能因此把这只野生动物独自留在家中，于是猫得跟着。尽管就猫咪坐萨博时该不该垫报纸这个问题，他们产生了分歧。欧维先把猫摁在了两篇娱乐新闻上，猫马上非常反感地用后腿把报纸踹到了地上，然后舒适地往柔软的坐垫上一躺。欧维用力一把揪着猫的后脖颈把它拽了起来，对此猫报以不怎么被动的攻击型唬叫，而欧维扯了三篇文化新闻和书评垫在猫下面。与此同时，猫咪投来恼怒的目光，但之后却出人意料地坐了上去，还很安静，只是有些伤心地看着窗外。欧维觉得自己终于在对决中取得胜利，满意地点点头，把萨博挂上挡，转上大路。就在这时，猫咪缓慢而刻意地用三根脚爪在报纸上撕开一道大口子，透过口子，两个前爪都伸到了坐垫上，同时充满挑衅地瞪着欧维，像是问：“这下你拿我怎么办吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they get to the churchyard, Ove plays it safe and scrunches up the remains of the newspaper into a ball, with which he roughly pushes the cat out of the car. Then he gets the flowers out of the trunk, locks the Saab with his key, makes a circuit around it, and checks each of the doors. Together they climb the frozen graveled slope leading up to the church turn-off and force their way through the snow, before they stop by Sonja. Ove brushes some snow off the gravestone with the back of his hand and gives the flowers a little shake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到教堂墓园以后，以防万一，欧维把剩下的报纸卷成一根大棒，三下五除二地把猫撵下了车。他又从后备箱里取出花，用钥匙锁上萨博，绕着它转了一圈，把所有的车门检查了一遍。猫坐在地上，抬头看着他。欧维看都不看它一眼，迈步走过。他们一起爬上教堂后山坡上冻硬了的砾石路，迂回穿过积雪，来到索雅跟前。欧维用手背清理掉墓碑上的雪，晃一晃手中的花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Ove comes back with the flowers and discovers that his whole car is full of cat saliva, he waves his forefinger in a threatening manner, as if it were a scimitar. And then the cat bites his scimitar. Ove refuses to speak to him for the rest of the journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当欧维捧着花回来，发现车里沾满了猫的口水后，他愤怒地冲猫竖起了食指，就好像这食指是一把锋利的弯刀。紧接着猫就在他的弯刀上咬了一口。于是，接下来一路上，欧维都拒绝和猫咪说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove slams on the brakes of the Saab so that the cat, shocked, is thrown forward and bangs its nose against the dashboard. "THAT's what I have to say about it!" Ove's triumphant expression seems to say. After that, the cat refuses to look at Ove for the rest of the journey and just sits hunched up in a corner of the seat, rubbing its nose with one of its paws in a very offended way. But while Ove is inside the florist's, it licks long wet streaks across Ove's steering wheel, safety belt, and the inside of Ove's car door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维一脚急刹车踩停萨博，猫向前飞出，鼻子撞上了仪表盘，然后他看看猫，就像在回答：“这么办！”之后，一路上猫都没看欧维一眼，兀自蜷在座位一角，愤愤地用一个爪子揉鼻子。但趁欧维在花店里，它把方向盘、安全带和整个车门内侧舔了个遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
