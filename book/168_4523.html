<div class="line_en">The harpy of Ghis, Dany thought. Old Ghis had fallen five thousand years ago, if she remembered true; its legions shattered by the might of young Valyria, its brick walls pulled down, its streets and buildings turned to ash and cinder by dragonflame, its very fields sown with salt, sulfur, and skulls. The gods of Ghis were dead, and so too its people; these Astapori were mongrels, Ser Jorah said. Even the Ghiscari tongue was largely forgotten; the slave cities spoke the High Valyrian of their conquerors, or what they had made of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the center of the Plaza of Pride stood a red brick fountain whose waters smelled of brimstone, and in the center of the fountain a monstrous harpy made of hammered bronze. Twenty feet tall she reared. She had a woman's face, with gilded hair, ivory eyes, and pointed ivory teeth. Water gushed yellow from her heavy breasts. But in place of arms she had the wings of a bat or a dragon, her legs were the legs of an eagle, and behind she wore a scorpion's curled and venomous tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骄傲广场中央有个红砖砌的喷泉，其中的水闻起来有股硫磺味道，泉水中央是一座青铜打制的巨大鹰身女妖像，足足二十尺高。她有女人的脸——镀金的头发、象牙眼睛和尖锐的象牙牙齿——黄色的水从沉甸的乳房中潺潺涌出，但本该长手臂的地方却是类似蝙蝠或龙的翅膀，腿则为老鹰的腿，身后拖着一条卷曲而恶毒的蝎尾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tell the Westerosi whore to lower her eyes," the slaver Kraznys mo Nakloz complained to the slave girl who spoke for him. "I deal in meat, not metal. The bronze is not for sale.

<div class="line_en">Yet the symbol of the Old Empire still endured here, though this bronze monster had a heavy chain dangling from her talons, an open manacle at either end. The harpy of Ghis had a thunderbolt in her claws. This is the harpy of Astapor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Good Master Kraznys asks, are they not magnificent?" The girl spoke the Common Tongue well, for one who had never been to Westeros. No older than ten, she had the round flat face, dusky skin, and golden eyes of Naath. The Peaceful People, her folk were called. All agreed that they made the best slaves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kraznys mo Nakloz bobbed his head. He smelled as if he'd bathed in raspberries, this slaver, and his jutting red-black beard glistened with oil. He has larger breasts than I do, Dany reflected. She could see them through the thin sea-green silk of the gold-fringed tokar he wound about his body and over one shoulder. His left hand held the tokar in place as he walked, while his right clasped a short leather whip. "Are all Westerosi pigs so ignorant?" he complained. "All the world knows that the Unsullied are masters of spear and shield and shortsword." He gave Dany a broad smile. "Tell her what she would know, slave, and be quick about it. The day is hot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克拉兹尼·莫·纳克罗兹点点头。奴隶商人闻起来似乎刚用黑草莓水洗过澡，红黑相间的分叉胡上闪着油光。他的乳房比我还大，丹妮思忖，透过薄薄的海青色丝绸，能看到他的胸部。他身穿带金流苏的托卡长袍，在一侧肩膀扣住，走路时，左手固定住袍子，右手抓一根短皮鞭。“维斯特洛猪都这么无知吗？”他继续抱怨，“全世界都知道，无垢者在长矛、盾牌和短剑上的造诣无以伦比。”他朝丹妮夸张地一笑。“把情况统统告诉她，奴隶，讲快点。天气太热了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If the Unsullied felt the heat, however, they gave no hint of it. They could be made of brick themselves, the way they stand there. A thousand had been marched out of their barracks for her inspection; drawn up in ten ranks of one hundred before the fountain and its great bronze harpy, they stood stiffly at attention, their stony eyes fixed straight ahead. They wore nought but white linen clouts knotted about their loins, and conical bronze helms topped with a sharpened spike a foot tall. Kraznys had commanded them to lay down their spears and shields, and doff their swordbelts and quilted tunics, so the Queen of Westeros might better inspect the lean hardness of their bodies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如无垢者们也觉得热，至少丝毫没有表现出来。从站立的样子来看，他们似乎就是用砖块做成。一千名奴隶走出兵营，供她检阅，他们在喷泉和雄伟的青铜鹰身女妖像前排成十列，每列一百人，站得笔直端正，毫无情绪的眼睛直勾勾地瞪着前方。他们什么也没穿，只有腰缠的白色亚麻布和头戴的锥形青铜盔，上面有根一尺高的尖刺。克拉兹尼已命他们放下长矛和盾牌，解开束剑腰带于夹层外衣，以便维斯特洛女王仔细检视其坚实瘦长的身躯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That much at least is no lie. A matched pair of slave girls stood behind them, holding a striped silk awning over their heads, but even in the shade Dany felt light-headed, and Kraznys was perspiring freely. The Plaza of Pride had been baking in the sun since dawn. Even through the thickness of her sandals, she could feel the warmth of the red bricks underfoot. Waves of heat rose off them shimmering to make the stepped pyramids of Astapor around the plaza seem half a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少这句不假。他们身后站着一对孪生女奴，为他们分别撑起丝绸斑纹遮阳伞，即便如此，丹妮仍透不过气，克拉兹尼则汗流如注。骄傲广场自黎明开始就在艳阳的烘烤之下，透过厚厚的鞋底，也能感觉脚下红砖的热量。波波热浪自红砖地里升腾而起，令广场周围的阿斯塔波阶梯形金字塔看起来好似海市蜃楼一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kraznys mo Nakloz supposedly spoke no word of the Common Tongue, but he bobbed his head as he listened, and from time to time gave the slave girl a poke with the end of his lash. "Tell her that these have been standing here for a day and a night, with no food nor water. Tell her that they will stand until they drop if I should command it, and when nine hundred and ninety-nine have collapsed to die upon the bricks, the last will stand there still, and never move until his own death claims him. Such is their courage. Tell her that."</div>

<div class="line_en">"They are chosen young, for size and speed and strength," the slave told her. "They begin their training at five. Every day they train from dawn to dusk, until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears. The training is most rigorous, Your Grace. Only one boy in three survives it. This is well known. Among the Unsullied it is said that on the day they win their spiked cap, the worst is done with, for no duty that will ever fall to them could be as hard as their training."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“以身材、速度和力量为标准，他们从小被挑选出来，”奴隶女孩告诉她，“并自五岁起接受训练。每天从黎明一直练到天黑，直到熟练掌握短剑、盾牌和三种长矛。训练极为严酷，陛下，三个男孩里只有一个存活，这是众所周知的事实。关于无垢者有个说法：从赢得尖刺盔的那一天起，最艰难的生活便已过去，从今往后任何使命都不及当初的训练那样严酷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What did the smelly old man say?" the slaver demanded of his translator. When she told him, he smiled and said, "Inform the savages that we call this obedience. Others may be stronger or quicker or larger than the Unsullied. Some few may even equal their skill with sword and spear and shield. But nowhere between the seas will you ever find any more obedient."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那臭烘烘的老头讲什么？”奴隶商人向翻译提问。等她说完，他微笑道，“告诉那蛮子，我们称此为‘顺从’。其他战士也许比无垢者更强壮、更敏捷，或更高大，甚至可能跟他们使用剑、盾与长矛的技能不相上下，但四海之内你找不到比他们更懂得顺从的士兵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I call that madness, not courage," said Arstan Whitebeard, when the solemn little scribe was done. He tapped the end of his hardwood staff against the bricks, tap tap, as if to tell his displeasure. The old man had not wanted to sail to Astapor; nor did he favor buying this slave army. A queen should hear all sides before reaching a decision. That was why Dany had brought him with her to the Plaza of Pride, not to keep her safe. Her bloodriders would do that well enough. Ser Jorah Mormont she had left aboard Balerion to guard her people and her dragons. Much against her inclination, she had locked the dragons belowdecks. It was too dangerous to let them fly freely over the city; the world was all too full of men who would gladly kill them for no better reason than to name themselves dragonslayer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是疯狂，不是勇气！”等那严肃的小翻译讲完，白胡子阿斯坦脱口而出。他用硬木拐杖敲打砖地，嗒，嗒，仿佛在诉说他的不满。老人不愿航至阿斯塔波，也不赞成购买这支奴隶军团。女王需要聆听所有人的话，这是丹妮将他带到骄傲广场的原因，并非拿他当护卫，有血盟卫已经够了。乔拉爵士被她留在贝勒里恩号上守护她的子民和她的龙。她将龙锁在甲板下，虽不情愿，但让他们在城市上空自由飞翔过于危险——世界上充斥着各种恶人，只为获得“屠龙者”的名号，就可能下毒手。">查看中文翻译</div>

More than half had the copper skins and almond eyes of Dothraki and Lhazerene, but she saw men of the Free Cities in the ranks as well, along with pale Qartheen, ebon-faced Summer Islanders, and others whose origins she could not guess. And some had skins of the same amber hue as Kraznys mo Nakloz, and the bristly red-black hair that marked the ancient folk of Ghis, who named themselves the harpy's sons. They sell even their ovm kind. It should not have surprised her. The Dothraki did the same, when khalasar met khalasar in the sea of grass.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The wine of courage," was the answer he gave her. "It is no true wine at all, but made from deadly nightshade, bloodfly larva, black lotus root, and many secret things. They drink it with every meal from the day they are cut, and with each passing year feel less and less. It makes them fearless in battle. Nor can they be tortured. Tell the savage her secrets are safe with the Unsullied. She may set them to guard her councils and even her bedchamber, and never a worry as to what they might overhear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是勇气之酒的缘故，”他回答。“那并非真正的酒，而是由颠茄、血蝇幼虫、黑莲藕及其他秘方调制而成的饮料。从被阉割那一天起，他们每餐都喝，日复一日，年复一年，直到感觉变得麻木，直到战斗变得无畏，直到不怕任何折磨。告诉那蛮子，任何秘密都可以放心交给无垢者保管，还可安排其守卫会议厅，甚至卧室，丝毫不必担心会遭偷听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In Yunkai and Meereen, eunuchs are often made by removing a boy's testicles, but leaving the penis. Such a creature is infertile, yet often still capable of erection. Only trouble can come of this. We remove the penis as well, leaving nothing. The Unsullied are the purest creatures on the earth." He gave Dany and Arstan another of his broad white smiles. "I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn vows to keep chaste and father no children, but live only for their duty. Is it not so?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在渊凯和弥林，制造太监的方法是除去睾丸，但留下阴茎。这样的人不能生育，却还可以勃起，只会造成麻烦。我们把阴茎也除掉，什么都不留。无垢者是全世界最纯净的动物。”他再次朝丹妮和阿斯坦露出夸张的笑容。“听说在日落国度，有人庄严宣誓保持贞洁，不生不育，仅为职责而活。是这样吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Their days are a torment of temptation, any fool must see, and no doubt most succumb to their baser selves. Not so our Unsullied.

Tell the whore of Westeros that the mark is for the child's owner, not the mother. The Unsullied are not permitted to steal." He tapped his whip against his leg. "Tell her that few ever fail that test. The dogs are harder for them, it must be said. We give each boy a puppy on the day that he is cut. At the end of the first year, he is required to strangle it.

Once we sold by the ten, as household guards, but that proved unsound. Ten is too few. They mingle with other slaves, even freemen, and forget who and what they are." Kraznys waited for that to be rendered in the Common Tongue, and then continued. "This beggar queen must understand, such wonders do not come cheaply. In Yunkai and Meereen, slave swordsmen can be had for less than the price of their swords, but Unsullied are the finest foot in all the world, and each represents many years of training.

<div class="line_en">Astapor was a queer city, even to the eyes of one who had walked within the House of Dust and bathed in the Womb of the World beneath the Mother of Mountains. All the streets were made of the same red brick that had paved the plaza. So too were the stepped pyramids, the deep-dug fighting pits with their rings of descending seats, the sulfurous fountains and gloomy wine caves, and the ancient walls that encircled them. So many bricks, she thought, and so old and crumbling. Their fine red dust was everywhere, dancing down the gutters at each gust of wind. Small wonder so many Astapori women veiled their faces; the brick dust stung the eyes worse than sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走过尘埃之殿，沐浴过圣母山下的世界子宫湖，然而在她眼里，阿斯塔波仍是座奇异的城市。所有街道都跟骄傲广场一样，全由红砖砌成，红砖砌的还有阶梯形金字塔、深挖入地并带有圈圈逐渐下降坐席的斗技场、含硫磺的喷泉池、阴暗的酒肆及环城古墙。如此多的砖块，她心想，如此古老，如此脆弱。空中都是细小的红色粉尘，微风吹过，粉尘便沿着阴沟飞舞。难怪阿斯塔波的妇女都蒙着脸，砖粉比沙子更易刺痛眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank the Good Master for his patient kindness," Dany said, "and tell him that I will think on all I learned here." She gave her arm to Arstan Whitebeard, to lead her back across the plaza to her litter. Aggo and Jhogo fell in to either side of them, walking with the bowlegged swagger all the horselords affected when forced to dismount and stride the earth like common mortals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“感谢善主大人的耐心和好意，”丹妮道，“告诉他我会仔细考虑在这儿了解的情况。”她向白胡子阿斯坦伸出胳膊，让他挽自己穿过广场，走向坐轿。阿戈和乔戈跟在两侧，弯腿昂首阔步，这是马王被迫下马和普通人一样步行时的惯用姿势。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany climbed into her litter frowning, and beckoned Arstan to climb in beside her. A man as old as him should not be walking in such heat. She did not close the curtains as they got under way. With the sun beating down so fiercely on this city of red brick, every stray breeze was to be cherished, even if it did come with a swirl of fine red dust. Besides, I need to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮皱眉爬进轿子，并招呼阿斯坦进来坐到身边，他这么年迈的人不该在艳阳下步行。行进途中，她没关帘子。这座红砖之城被阳光炽烈地烘烤，每丝微风都值得珍惜，即使其中伴随着缕缕红色粉尘。况且，我需要观察。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Make way!" Jhogo shouted as he rode before her litter. "Make way for the Mother of Dragons!" But when he uncoiled the great silverhandled whip that Dany had given him, and made to crack it in the air, she leaned out and told him nay. "Not in this place, blood of my blood," she said, in his own tongue. "These bricks have heard too much of the sound of whips."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让路！”乔戈在轿子前面骑行，高声呼喊，“给龙之母让路！”见他展开银柄长鞭，在空中挥得喇喇作响，她忙探身制止。“别在这里，吾血之血，”她用多斯拉克语说，“这些砖块已听过太多的鞭响。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The streets had been largely deserted when they had set out from the port that morning, and scarcely seemed more crowded now. An elephant lumbered past with a latticework litter on its back. A naked boy with peeling skin sat in a dry brick gutter, picking his nose and staring sullenly at some ants in the street. He lifted his head at the sound of hooves, and gaped as a column of mounted guards trotted by in a cloud of red dust and brittle laughter. The copper disks sewn to their cloaks of yellow silk glittered like so many suns, but their tunics were embroidered linen, and below the waist they wore sandals and pleated linen skirts. Bareheaded, each man had teased and oiled and twisted his stiff red-black hair into some fantastic shape, horns and wings and blades and even grasping hands, so they looked like some troupe of demons escaped from the seventh hell. The naked boy watched them for a bit, along with Dany, but soon enough they were gone, and he went back to his ants, and a knuckle up his nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上，当他们从港口出发时，街上杳无人烟，现在已是下午，却似乎仍旧空旷。一头大象缓缓走过，背上驮着个格子座箱。一名被晒得蜕皮的男孩光着身子坐在干涸的红砖排水沟里，一边挖鼻子一边闷闷不乐地注视着街道上的蚂蚁。听见马蹄声，他抬起头来，茫然地看待一队骑兵飞驰而过，刺耳的笑声伴随着蹄下掀起的红色尘土。士兵们的黄丝披风上缝有许多闪亮铜盘，好似无数太阳，外衣是带刺绣的亚麻布，腰部以下则穿打褶布裙和凉鞋。他们不戴帽子，每人都将红黑相间的直立头发梳理上油，盘成各种奇怪的形状，有犄角、翅膀、刀锋，甚至抓握的手，因此他们就像一群从七层地狱里出来的恶鬼。丹妮和光着身子的男孩一起看了一阵，直到他们消失，接着男孩又回去看蚂蚁，手指伸向鼻孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her litter came to a sudden halt at the cross street, to allow a coffle of slaves to shuffle across her path, urged along by the crack of an overseer's lash. These were no Unsullied, Dany noted, but a more common sort of men, with pale brown skins and black hair. There were women among them, but no children. All were naked. Two Astapori rode behind them on white asses, a man in a red silk tokar and a veiled woman in sheer blue linen decorated with flakes of lapis lazuli. In her red-black hair she wore an ivory comb. The man laughed as he whispered to her, paying no more mind to Dany than to his slaves, nor the overseer with his twisted five-thonged lash, a squat broad Dothraki who had the harpy and chains tattooed proudly across his muscular chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">He has a good face, and great strength to him, Dany thought. She could not understand why Ser Jorah mistrusted the old man so. Could he be jealous that I have found another man to talk to? Unbidden, her thoughts went back to the night on Balerion when the exile knight had kissed her. He should never have done that. He is thrice my age, and of too low a birth for me, and I never gave him leave. No true knight would ever kiss a queen without her leave. She had taken care never to be alone with Ser Jorah after that, keeping her handmaids with her aboard ship, and sometimes her bloodriders. He wants to kiss me again, I see it in his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不仅有张慈祥的脸孔，身上还蕴涵着巨大的力量，丹妮心想，真不明白乔拉爵士为何不信任他。难道他妒忌我找到了其他可以倾诉的男人？她的思绪不由自主地回到在贝勒里恩号上被放逐的骑士亲吻她的那个夜晚。他不该这么做。他年纪是我三倍，相对于我又出生太低，况且没有得到我的准许。未经女王准许，真正的骑士决不会亲吻他的女王。在那之后，她小心翼翼，再没跟乔拉爵士独处过，身边一直有女仆或血盟卫陪伴。但他想再吻我，我从他的眼睛里能看出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I shall try and remember." Whitebeard smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会记住的。”白胡子微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only lies offend me, never honest counsel." Dany patted Arstan's spotted hand to reassure him. "I have a dragon's temper, that's all. You must not let it frighten you."</div>

<div class="line_en">What Dany wanted she could not begin to say, but Jorah's kiss had woken something in her, something that been sleeping since Khal Drogo died. Lying abed in her narrow bunk, she found herself wondering how it would be to have a man squeezed in beside her in place of her handmaid, and the thought was more exciting than it should have been. Sometimes she would close her eyes and dream of him, but it was never Jorah Mormont she dreamed of; her lover was always younger and more comely, though his face remained a shifting shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮自己的欲望无从名状，但乔拉的吻的确唤醒了某种东西，某种自卓戈卡奥死后便一直沉睡着的东西。躺在狭窄的铺位上，她常常幻想挤在身边的不是侍女，而是某位男子。这个念头令她奇妙地兴奋。有时候，闭上眼睛就会梦到“他”，但“他”从来不是乔拉·莫尔蒙，“他”更年轻更标致，虽然面容始终是团朦胧的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, so tormented she could not sleep, Dany slid a hand down between her legs, and gasped when she felt how wet she was. Scarce daring to breathe, she moved her fingers back and forth between her lower lips, slowly so as not to wake Irri beside her, until she found one sweet spot and lingered there, touching herself lightly, timidly at first and then faster. Still, the relief she wanted seemed to recede before her, until her dragons stirred, and one screamed out across the cabin, and Irri woke and saw what she was doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，丹妮被折磨得无法入睡，手不自禁地滑向两腿之间，当她摸到那里竟如此湿润时，不禁屏住了呼吸。她的指头在阴唇间来回移动，动作很慢，也几乎不敢喘气，以免惊醒身边的伊丽，直到找到一个舒适的点，便停留在那里，轻轻抚弄，起初尚羞涩犹疑，随后越来越快，然而渴求的安慰依旧遥不可及，直到最后惊动了她的龙。其中一只在船舱彼端嘶叫起来，伊丽发现了她的动作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dany knew her face was flushed, but in the darkness Irri surely could not tell. Wordless, the handmaid put a hand on her breast, then bent to take a nipple in her mouth. Her other hand drifted down across the soft curve of belly, through the mound of fine silvery-gold hair, and went to work between Dany's thighs. It was no more than a few moments until her legs twisted and her breasts heaved and her whole body shuddered. She screamed then. Or perhaps that was Drogon. Irri never said a thing, only curled back up and went back to sleep the instant the thing was done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮知道自己涨红了脸，但黑暗之中，伊丽肯定看不见。女仆无言地将一只手搭上她的乳房，俯身含住乳头，另一只手则沿着她腹部柔和的曲线滑下去，穿过银金色的细发丛，在大腿之间运动。不过一小会儿，她便双腿扭曲，乳房高耸，整个身子都开始颤抖，接着便尖叫起来。抑或那是卓耿的尖叫？伊丽一言不发，完事之后蜷起身子重新入眠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Closer to the bay, the city presented a fairer face. The great brick pyramids lined the shore, the largest four hundred feet high. All manner of trees and vines and flowers grew on their broad terraces, and the winds that swirled around them smelled green and fragrant. Another gigantic harpy stood atop the gate, this one made of baked red clay and crumbling visibly, with no more than a stub of her scorpion's tail remaining. The chain she grasped in her clay claws was old iron, rotten with rust. It was cooler down by the water, though. The lapping of the waves against the rotting pilings made a curiously soothing sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="愈靠近海湾，城市变得愈美丽。巨大的砖块金字塔沿岸排列，最大的有四百尺高。它们宽敞的平台上生长着各种树木、藤蔓与花草，阵阵芬芳的清风在其间旋绕。另一座巨型鹰身女妖像立在港口城门上，由烧硬的红土制成，已明显风化，蝎尾只剩一小截，而泥爪子里陈旧的铁锁链，业已生锈腐烂。水边比较凉快，而丹妮奇怪地发现，波涛击打腐烂桩子的声响竟令人宽心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day, it all seemed a dream. And what did Ser Jorah have to do with it, if anything? It is Drogo I want, my sun-andstars, Dany reminded herself. Not Irri, and not Ser forah, only Drogo. Drogo was dead, though. She'd thought these feelings had died with him there in the red waste, but one treacherous kiss had somehow brought them back to life. He should never have kissed me. He presumed too much, and I permitted it. It must never happen again. She set her mouth grimly and gave her head a shake, and the bell in her braid chimed softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，一切就像一场梦。即使发生过什么，那跟乔拉爵士又有何关系？我要的是卓戈，我的日和星，丹妮提醒自己，不是伊丽，不是乔拉爵士，只有卓戈。然而卓戈已死，她以为所有的感觉都随他在红色荒原中消逝，但区区一个叛逆的吻不知怎的又将它们重新唤醒。他不该吻我。他擅自行事，我却听之任之，这绝不能再发生了。她郁闷地抿起嘴，摇晃着脑袋，辫子里的铃铛轻响。">查看中文翻译</div>

From here it looks almost beautiful, she thought. The stars were coming out above, and the silk lanterns below, just as Kraznys's translator had promised. The brick pyramids were all glimmery with light. But it is dark below, in the streets and plazas and fighting pits. And it is darkest of all in the barracks, where some little boy is feeding scraps to the puppy they gave him when they took away his manhood.</div>

More women were raped than you can count. There is a savage beast in every man, and when you hand that man a sword or spear and send him forth to war, the beast stirs. The scent of blood is all it takes to wake him. Yet I have never heard of these Unsullied raping, nor putting a city to the sword, nor even plundering, save at the express command of those who lead them. Brick they may be, as you say, but if you buy them henceforth the only dogs they'll kill are those you want dead. And you do have some dogs you want dead, as I recall."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Usurper's dogs. "Yes." Dany gazed off at the soft colored lights and let the cool salt breeze caress her. "You speak of sacking cities. Answer me this, ser -- why have the Dothraki never sacked this city?" She pointed. "Look at the walls. You can see where they've begun to crumble. There, and there. Do you see any guards on those towers? I don't. Are they hiding, ser? I saw these sons of the harpy today, all their proud highborn warriors. They dressed in linen skirts, and the fiercest thing about them was their hair. Even a modest khalasar could crack this Astapor like a nut and spill out the rotted meat inside. So tell me, why is that ugly harpy not sitting beside the godsway in Vaes Dothrak among the other stolen gods?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="篡位者的走狗。“是的。”丹妮注视着柔和的彩光，任凉爽腥涩的微风吹拂。“说到洗劫城市，回答我，爵士——多斯拉克人为何从没洗劫过这座城市？”她向前一指。“看看那些墙，它们已经开始崩塌，那儿，还有那儿。你能看到塔楼里的卫兵吗？我没看到。他们躲起来了吗，爵士？我今天目睹所谓的鹰身女妖之子，全是些骄傲自大的贵族，穿着布裙，浑身上下只有发型吓人。即便一个最普通的卡拉萨，也能把阿斯塔波像核桃一样敲碎，挑出里面腐烂的肉。告诉我，为何这只丑陋的鹰身女妖像没有在多斯拉克海中的诸神大道边，跟其他偷来的神像待在一起？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are two reasons. Astapor's brave defenders are so much chaff, it's true. Old names and fat purses who dress up as Ghiscari scourges to pretend they still rule a vast empire. Every one is a high officer. On feastdays they fight mock wars in the pits to demonstrate what brilliant commanders they are, but it's the eunuchs who do the dying. All the same, any enemy wanting to sack Astapor would have to know that they'd be facing Unsullied. The slavers would turn out the whole garrison in the city's defense. The Dothraki have not ridden against Unsullied since they left their braids at the gates of Qohor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原因有二。首先，您说得没错，阿斯塔波勇敢的守卫者们不过是些废物。他们所剩的只有古老的名望和鼓鼓的钱包，却要打扮成夕日的吉斯长鞭手，装作自己仍旧统治着一个大帝国。每人都是军官，每人的头衔都极夸张。节庆日里，他们在斗技场中模拟战争，以显示英勇，但死的却是太监。然而任何想与阿斯塔波作对的人都知道，对手将是无垢者，一旦形势危急，奴隶商人们会让所有部队倾巢出动。别的不说，多斯拉克人自从在科霍尔城门口留下辫子之后，就再没跟无垢者打过。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Carrying them off where? What good are slaves once you've killed the slavers? Valyria is no more, Qarth lies beyond the red waste, and the Nine Free Cities are thousands of leagues to the west. And you may be sure the sons of the harpy give lavishly to every passing khal, just as the magisters do in Pentos and Norvos and Myr. They know that if they feast the horselords and give them gifts, they will soon ride on. It's cheaper than fighting, and a deal more certain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“卖给谁？一旦把贩买奴隶的商人都杀了，奴隶还有什么用呢？瓦雷利亚已然式微，魁尔斯位于红色荒原的另一边，而九大自由贸易城邦远在千里之外的西方。况且您可以想见，鹰身女妖之子肯定给予每位路过的卡奥丰厚的馈赠，就和潘托斯、诺佛斯与密尔的总督们所做的一样。只需宴请马王，赠予礼物，他们很快就会继续上路。这比战斗的代价要小，也更可靠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
