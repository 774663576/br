<div class="line_en">"King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat, in the castle built by his son," Ser Arys said. "He is the dragon's heir -- and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey's ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that he will triumph over his enemies."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，乔佛里国王的宝座是以前龙王伊耿的位子，他的城堡也是由伊耿的儿子所建筑。”亚历斯爵士道，“他是真龙的继承人——况且深红又是兰尼斯特家族的颜色，这也是一个象征。依我之见，彗星定是上天送来宣告乔佛里国王陛下登基的，它预示着他终将击败敌人，赢得最后胜利。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Glory to your betrothed," Ser Arys answered at once. "See how it flames across the sky today on His Grace's name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey's Comet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是上天派来荣耀您的未婚夫的，”亚历斯爵士立时回答，“你看，它闪着光辉，在陛下的命名日划过天际，好似诸神为他举起了旗帜，以示尊崇。老百姓都把它叫做‘乔佛里国王彗星’。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning of King Joffrey's name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. "What do you think it means?" she asked him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔佛里国王命名日的那天早上，阳光明媚，时有清风。珊莎站在塔楼窗边，看着大彗星的长尾巴，透过疾走流云，昭然可见。这时，亚历斯·奥克赫特爵士前来护送她去比武会场。“你觉得这颗彗星代表着什么？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Is it true? she wondered. Would the gods be so cruel? Her mother was one of Joffrey's enemies now, her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king's command. Must Robb and her lady mother die next? The comet was red, but Joffrey was Baratheon as much as Lannister, and their sigil was a black stag on a golden field. Shouldn't the gods have sent Joff a golden comet?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真的吗？她不禁暗想，诸神真会如此残酷吗？眼下乔佛里的敌人就包括她自己的母亲，还有哥哥罗柏。父亲已经死于国王令下，难道接下来就要轮到罗柏和母亲了吗？彗星是红色的没错，可乔佛里不只是兰尼斯特家的人，他也是拜拉席恩家族的后代呀，而他们的标志是金底黑鹿，诸神怎不给小乔一颗金色的彗星呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shall we go?" Ser Arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber. If she must have one of the Kingsguard dogging her steps, Sansa preferred that it be him. Ser Boros was short-tempered, Ser Meryn cold, and Ser Mandon's strange dead eyes made her uneasy, while Ser Preston treated her like a lackwit child. Arys Oakheart was courteous, and would talk to her cordially. Once he even objected when Joffrey commanded him to hit her. He did hit her in the end, but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser Boros might have, and at least he had argued. The others obeyed without question… except for the Hound, but Joff never asked the Hound to punish her. He used the other five for that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们走吧？”亚历斯爵士伸出手，她挽起来，随他走出房间。假如珊莎非得从御林铁卫里选一个作跟班，她宁愿是他。柏洛斯爵士脾气暴躁，马林爵士冷酷无情，曼登爵士那双怪异的死人眼总教她不舒服，普列斯顿爵士则一副当她弱智小鬼的神情。只有亚历斯·奥克赫特爵士彬彬有礼，会真诚地和她说话。有次乔佛里命令他打她，他居然还表示抗议，后来他虽然还是打了，但出手比马林爵士和柏洛斯爵士轻得多。他好歹为她求过情，其他人遇上这种情形，都是绝对服从…当然，猎狗例外。可小乔都叫另外五人打她，从不叫猎狗动手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window. "You look very lovely today, my lady," Ser Arys said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎骤然阖上窗子，转身背离窗边。“小姐，您今天真漂亮。”亚历斯爵士说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, ser." Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor, Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes. She wore a gown of pale purple silk and a moonstone hair net that had been a gift from Joffrey. The gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on her arms. Those were Joffrey's gifts as well. When they told him that Robb had been proclaimed King in the North, his rage had been a fearsome thing, and he had sent Ser Boros to beat her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，爵士先生。”珊莎知道乔佛里要她出席比武大会以示贺意，便特别精心打扮过。她穿了一袭淡紫色礼服，戴着乔佛里送的月长石发网。礼服的袖子很长，掩饰了她手上的瘀伤，那也是乔佛里的‘礼物’——他一听说罗柏自立为北境之王，气得发狂，便派柏洛斯爵士来揍她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will," Ser Arys answered, smiling. "Yet I fear the triumph will have no savor. This will be a small field, and poor. No more than two score will enter the lists, including squires and freeriders. There is small honor in unhorsing green boys."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是我。”亚历斯爵士微笑着回答，“只可惜这种胜利不足挂齿。这只是小场面、小比试，参加者不超过四十人，其中还包括侍从和自由骑手。把毛头小子打下马一点也不光彩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Arys had light brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon. Today he made quite the dashing figure, with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf, and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread. "Who do you think will win the day's honors?" Sansa asked as they descended the steps arm in arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚历斯爵士有淡褐色的头发，脸长得也不难看。今天他的白丝披风用一片金叶扣在肩头，外衣胸前则用闪亮的金线绣了一棵枝叶繁茂的橡树，看起来十分潇洒。“在您看来，今天会由谁胜出呢？”他们一边手挽着手走下楼梯，珊莎一边问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last tourney had been different, Sansa reflected. King Robert had staged it in her father's honor. High lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to compete, and the whole city had turned out to watch. She remembered the splendor of it: the field of pavilions along the river with a knight's shield hung before each door, the long rows of silken pennants waving in the wind, the gleam of sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs. The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves, and the nights had been full of feasts and song. Those had been the most magical days of her life, but they seemed a memory from another age now. Robert Baratheon was dead, and her father as well, beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor. Now there were three kings in the land, and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men. Small wonder that they had to hold Joff's tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上次的比武大会可就不一样了，珊莎心想。那是劳勃国王特别为她父亲举办的，当时全国各地的达官贵人和英雄武士竞相涌至，互相较劲，而君临全城居民也都到场观看。她至今仍记得当时的空前盛况：河岸布满帐蓬，骑士的盾牌各自悬挂在营帐门口，一长列丝质三角旗随风飘扬，精钢刀剑和镀金马刺闪着耀眼阳光。比武那几天，号角长鸣，马蹄轰隆，入夜之后则是宴席大开，弦歌不辍。那是她一生中最灿烂的日子，如今却恍如隔世。劳勃·拜拉席恩已不在人间，她的父亲则被视作叛国贼，斩首于贝勒大圣堂前的讲坛上。现在国内三王各据一方，三叉戟河彼岸战火炽烈，君临城中则挤满了来自各方、走投无路的人，难怪他们只能在有厚厚城墙庇护的红堡里为乔佛里举办比武竞技。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I fear not, my lady. The council is meeting, some urgent business." Ser Arys dropped his voice. "Lord Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded. Her Grace is furious." He fell silent as a column of Lannister guardsmen marched past, in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. Ser Arys was fond of gossip, but only when he was certain that no one was listening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕不会，小姐。重臣们正在开会，说是有要紧事。”亚历斯爵士压低声音，“泰温大人率兵朝赫伦堡前进，不愿照太后的命令领军至此。太后她可是气坏了。”这时一队身披红披风，头戴狮纹盔的兰尼斯特卫士从旁经过，他立即噤声。亚历斯爵士虽好说闲话，却知要提防隔墙有耳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey. It was a poor thing indeed, and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats. Most of the spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House Lannister; of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few, the handful that remained at court. Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk. Lady Tanda was bracketed by her daughters, placid dull Lollys and acid-tongued Falyse. Ebon-skinned Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge, Lady Ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurse's lap. The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queen's cousins, so the Lannisters might claim her lands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木匠在城堡外庭筑起了看台和竞技场，但其规模的确小得可怜，而前来观赏的人群还只稀稀落落坐了个半满。观众多半是穿着金袍子的都城守备队或深红披风的的兰尼斯特卫士，到场的贵族男女为数极少，只有那几个还留在宫里的人：脸色死灰的盖尔斯·罗斯比伯爵就着一条粉红丝巾咳个没完；坦妲伯爵夫人被两个女儿——文静但迟钝的洛丽丝和毒舌的法丽丝——夹在中间；黑皮肤的贾拉巴·梭尔遭到放逐，原本便无处可去；艾弥珊德小姐还是个小婴儿，躺坐在乳母膝上。据说她不久便要嫁给太后的某个堂弟，如此兰尼斯特家族才好接收她的封地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Princess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa's name, but plump little Prince Tommen jumped up eagerly. "Sansa, did you hear? I'm to ride in the tourney today. Mother said I could." Tommen was all of eight. He reminded her of her own little brother, Bran. They were of an age. Bran was back at Winterfell, a cripple, yet safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy, one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of his chair. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen sat behind him. In the back of the royal box, Sandor Clegane stood at guard, his hands resting on his swordbelt. The white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch, the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin. "Lady Sansa," the Hound announced curtly when he saw her. His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood. The burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke.</div>

There were shouts from the watching guardsmen and the lords and ladies in the gallery. The knights came together in the center of the yard with a great shock of wood and steel. The white lance and the striped one exploded in splinters within a second of each other. Hobber Redwyne reeled at the impact, yet somehow managed to keep his seat.

<div class="line_en">"Ser Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch," came the herald's cry. Wide white wings ornamented Ser Balon's greathelm, and black and white swans fought on his shield. "Morros of House Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“红卫地石盔城的巴隆·史文爵士！”司仪的喊声再度传来。巴隆爵士的头盔上饰有一双宽大的白翅膀，盾牌上则绘了黑白天鹅互斗的图案。“史林特家族的莫洛斯，赫伦堡杰诺斯伯爵的继承人！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But on their second pass Ser Meryn swung the point of his lance to strike Ser Hobber in the chest, driving him from the saddle to crash resoundingly to the earth. Ser Horas cursed and ran out to help his battered brother from the field.</div>

<div class="line_en">I hope he falls and shames himself, she thought bitterly. I hope Ser Balon kills him. When Joffrey proclaimed her father's death, it had been Janos Slynt who seized Lord Eddard's severed head by the hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold, while Sansa wept and screamed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他最好从马上摔下来，在大家面前丢脸，她苦涩地想，我希望巴隆爵士杀了他。乔佛里宣判她父亲死刑，斩首之后，正是杰诺斯·史林特将艾德公爵的首级连发抓起，高举示众，而珊莎却只能在旁啜泣哀嚎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look at that upjumped oaf," Joff hooted, loud enough for half the yard to hear. Morros, a mere squire and a new-made squire at that, was having difficulty managing lance and shield. The lance was a knight's weapon, Sansa knew, the Slynts lowborn. Lord Janos had been no more than commander of the City Watch before Joffrey had raised him to Harrenhal and the council.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧他那副驴样！”小乔高声怪叫，声音之大，半场都能听见。莫洛斯只是个侍从，还是个刚当上的侍从，连拿枪举盾都有困难。珊莎知道，长枪是骑士的武器，而史林特家出身低贱。杰诺斯伯爵本来只是都城守备队的司令官，近来才被乔佛里擢升为赫伦堡领主和朝廷重臣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Morros wore a checkered black-and-gold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork. On his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their new-made house. But he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward, and Ser Balon's point struck the blazon square. Morros dropped his lance, fought for balance, and lost. One foot caught in a stirrup as he fell, and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists, head bouncing against the ground. Joff hooted derision. Sansa was appalled, wondering if the gods had heard her vengeful prayer. But when they disentangled Morros Slynt from his horse, they found him bloodied but alive. "Tommen, we picked the wrong foe for you," the king told his brother. "The straw knight jousts better than that one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫洛斯的黑盔甲上镶了细致的金色涡形花纹，外罩黑金相间的格子披风。盾牌上画有血淋淋的长枪，那是他父亲挑选的家徽。然而他似乎不知该把盾牌放哪里才好，只会盲目地催马向前，结果巴隆爵士不经意地一枪戳中他盾心纹章。莫洛斯慌忙扔掉长枪，试图保持平衡，可惜还是失败。这少年摔下马时一只脚卡在马镫上，被狂燥的战马一路拖到场子尽头，脑袋不断在地上碰撞。乔佛里见状高声嘲笑，珊莎却大惊失色，不知诸神是否听见了她复仇的祈祷。最后大家总算把莫洛斯·史林特解下马，发现他虽浑身是血，人还活得好好的。“托曼，我们帮你挑错对手了。”国王对弟弟说，“这家伙比稻草人差劲得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next came Ser Horas Redwyne's turn. He fared better than his twin, vanquishing an elderly knight whose mount was bedecked with silver griffins against a striped blue-and-white field. Splendid as he looked, the old man made a poor contest of it. Joffrey curled his lip. "This is a feeble show."</div>

Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks, but Ser Dontos was not on it. The knight appeared a moment later, cursing and staggering, clad in breastplate and plumed helm and nothing else. His legs were pale and skinny, and his manhood flopped about obscenely as he chased after his horse. The watchers roared and shouted insults. Catching his horse by the bridle, Ser Dontos tried to mount, but the animal would not stand still and the knight was so drunk that his bare foot kept missing the stirrup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自由骑手当即出现在比武场西边，他的个子很小，身穿凹痕累累的铠甲，上无任何装饰，可他的对手却不见踪影。等了一阵，总算有一匹栗子色的骏马跑出来，一身大红丝绸随风飘动，然而唐托斯爵士却不在上面。又过了一会儿，唐托斯爵士方才脚步踉跄地赶到，一边咒骂，一边追着他的马，他全身上下除了胸甲和羽饰头盔外一丝不挂。他的双腿肤色苍白，细瘦伶仃，那话儿恶心地前后晃动。观众席上立时喝起倒采。唐托斯爵士抓住坐骑的缰绳，想要爬上马背，但马儿不肯站定不动，而骑士喝得酩酊大醉，光溜溜的脚始终踩不到马镫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In their midst, riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front, was the queen's dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister, the one they called the Imp. He had let his beard grow to cover his pushed-in face, until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair, coarse as wire. Down his back flowed a shadowskin cloak, black fur striped with white. He held the reins in his left hand and carried his right arm in a white silk sling, but otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when he had visited Winterfell. With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes, he was still the ugliest man she had ever chanced to look upon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这群人之中，骑着一匹高大红骏马，被怪异的垫高马鞍前后包住的，正是太后的侏儒弟弟，外号“小恶魔”的提利昂·兰尼斯特。他新长出的黄黑交杂的长胡子盖住了扁凹的脸，胡须纠缠不清，粗硬如铁线。他肩上飞舞着一件黑白条纹的影子山猫皮斗篷，他用左手握缰，右手悬着白丝吊带。除此之外，在珊莎看来，他和上次造访临冬城时一样畸形：额头突出，双眼大小不一，依旧是她生平所见最为丑陋的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet Tommen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard, shouting with glee. One of the savages, a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers, scooped the boy out of his saddle, armor and all, and deposited him on the ground beside his uncle. Tommen's breathless laughter echoed off the walls as Tyrion clapped him on the backplate, and Sansa was startled to see that the two were of a height. Myrcella came running after her brother, and the dwarf picked her up by the waist and spun her in a circle, squealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然如此，托曼却脚踢马刺，骑着小马快步驰过场子，口中兴奋地大喊。一名身躯高大，步伐稳健，胡须几乎遮掩住脸的野蛮人将男孩从马鞍上连人带甲抱起来，放在他舅舅旁边的地上。提利昂拍拍他的背甲，托曼喘不过气的笑声回响在城墙之间，珊莎惊讶地发现他们两人竟然是同等身高。弥赛拉跟在弟弟后面奔至，侏儒抱着她的腰转了一圈，让她开心地吱吱叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he lowered her back to the ground, the little man kissed her lightly on the brow and came waddling across the yard toward Joffrey. Two of his men followed close behind him; a black-haired black-eyed sellsword who moved like a stalking cat, and a gaunt youth with an empty socket where one eye should have been. Tommen and Myrcella trailed after them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后侏儒放开她，轻轻吻她额头，一跛一跛地穿过广场，朝乔佛里走来。他身后跟了两个人：一个是黑发黑眼的佣兵，举止有如追踪猎物的灵猫；另一个则是憔悴的青年，有一个眼窝是空的。托曼和弥赛拉跟在他们身后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Me," the Imp agreed, "although a more courteous greeting might be in order, for an uncle and an elder."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是我。”小恶魔应道，“不过对舅舅和长辈讲话，理应更礼貌一点。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa could not think of a word to say to him. How could he be sorry for her losses? Was he mocking her? It wasn't the gods who'd been cruel, it was Joffrey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎不知该说什么才好。他真的为她感到遗憾吗？还是在嘲弄她呢？残酷的不是诸神，而是乔佛里啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little man gave the big one a look. One of his eyes was green, one was black, and both were cool. "I was speaking to the king, not to his cur."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小个子看了大个子一眼。他的眼睛一只绿，一只黑，两眼均透着寒意。“我在跟国王说话，没空理他的恶狗。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Joffrey frowned. Sansa felt that she ought to say something. What was it that Septa Mordane used to tell her? A lady's armor is courtesy, that was it. She donned her armor and said, "I'm sorry my lady mother took you captive, my lord."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔佛里皱起眉头。珊莎觉得自己好像该说些什么。从前茉丹修女是怎么教她的？礼貌是贵妇人的盔甲。对，就是这句。于是她穿起盔甲，开口道：“大人，关于家母逮捕您一事，我感到非常抱歉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She's with my council," the king answered. "Your brother Jaime keeps losing battles." He gave Sansa an angry look, as if it were her fault. "He's been taken by the Starks and we've lost Riverrun and now her stupid brother is calling himself a king."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她和我的重臣们在开会。”国王答道，“你哥哥詹姆一直打败仗。”他愤怒地看了珊莎一眼，彷佛这都是她的错。“现在他被史塔克家抓去，我们不但丢了奔流城，连她的笨哥哥都自立为王了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sandor Clegane lingered behind a moment. "I'd guard that tongue of yours, little man," he warned, before he strode off after his liege.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑铎·克里冈多留了一会儿，“小个子，我劝你讲话注意一点。”警告完之后，他才大步跟着国王离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="现在只剩下珊莎和侏儒，以及他的那群怪物。她试着想说些什么，“您的手受伤了。”最后她勉强说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Joff did not know what to make of that, though he looked suspicious and out of sorts. "Yes. Well. I am pleased you're not dead, Uncle. Did you bring me a gift for my name day?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小乔不知该如何应对，但他看来十分不悦，满腹猜疑。“没错，嗯，舅舅，我也很高兴你没死。你有没有给我带命名日礼物啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"One of your northmen hit me with a morningstar during the battle on the Green Fork. I escaped him by falling off my horse." His grin turned into something softer as he studied her face. "Is it grief for your lord father that makes you so sad?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在绿叉河边打仗时，被你们北方人的流星锤砸到。我从马背上摔下去，才没被他打死。”他审视着她的面容，笑容变得温和了些。“为你父亲大人哀悼，是不是？你好哀伤。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lannister reached out and took her hand, and gave it a squeeze. "I am only a little lion, child, and I vow, I shall not savage you." Bowing, he said, "But now you must excuse me. I have urgent business with queen and council."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰尼斯特握住她的手，轻轻挤了一下。“孩子，我只是一头小狮子，而且我向你保证，我决不会欺负你。”说完他鞠个躬，“现在，请容我告辞，我有要紧事要呈报太后和重臣。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa watched him walk off, his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, like something from a grotesquerie. He speaks more gently than Joffrey, she thought, but the queen spoke to me gently too. He's still a Lannister, her brother and Joff's uncle, and no friend. Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all her heart, and admired and trusted his mother, the queen. They had repaid that love and trust with her father's head. Sansa would never make that mistake again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎目送他离去。他的身体随着踏出的每一步左右剧烈摇晃，彷佛一只来自奇人异兽图中的怪物。他比乔佛里温柔多了，她心想，但太后对我不也很温柔？他毕竟是兰尼斯特家的人，是太后的弟弟，小乔的舅舅，绝非我的朋友。曾经，她全心全意地爱着乔佛里王子，对他母亲，也就是当时的王后，则是大为倾慕、全然信任，结果他们回报她的却是父亲的首级。珊莎再也不会犯同样的错误了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Lions," she whispered, without thinking. She glanced about nervously, but there was no one close enough to hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是狮子。”她不假思索地悄声说，说完不禁紧张地环顾四周，幸好附近没人。">查看中文翻译</div>
