<div class="line_en">As time went on, Becky saw that their easy, pleasant life could not continue. Their money was nearly all gone, they were deeply in debt, and although Rawdon's great skill at billiards and cards gave him many gambling successes, it was not a reliable income. Indeed, many young officers now left Mrs Crawley's parties with sad faces, having lost rather too much money at her card-tables. Warnings were whispered to the inexperienced, and her house began to have an unfortunate reputation.</div>

<div class="line_en">At this point news reached Paris of Miss Crawley's death, delighting the many people to whom the Crawleys owed money. Naturally, the Crawleys hurried back to London to collect the enormous inheritance that the Colonel was expecting. They would soon return to Paris, Mrs Crawley told everyone, to pay all their bills, and to rent a grander house. As evidence of this intention, they left behind several boxes of possessions -- which were later opened and found to be full of worthless rubbish.</div>
