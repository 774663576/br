<div class="line_en">It was a palace, pure and simple, what her father would have called a perfect score. The room they had escaped into was the epitome of lavish. It was huge, easily bigger than Jill's entire house, tiled in gray-flecked marble and dominated by a wide, carpeted staircase that led to a second-floor balcony. Arched marble pillars lined the ornate hall, supporting the dark, heavy wood balustrade of the upper floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这明明就是一座宫殿，小队成员们所在的这个房间极其奢华，一点儿都看不出是废弃的别墅。总之这个大厅要比吉尔的整个家都要大，周围铺满了灰色斑纹的大理石地砖，大厅中央有一条楼梯通往二楼的露台，楼梯上还铺着厚厚的地毯。拱门型的大理石柱子矗立在华丽的大厅中央，在二楼还立有厚重的木质栏杆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill took a deep breath and decided immediately that she didn't like it. There was a sense of… wrong-ness to the vast room, an atmosphere of vague oppres-sion. It felt haunted somehow, though by who or what, she couldn't say.</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked toward the stairs clutching her handgun, her footsteps muffled by the plush carpet that led from the front door. There was an antique typewriter on a small table to the right of the steps, a blank sheet of paper spooled into the works. A strange bit of a decorum. The expansive hall was otherwise empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔握着手枪，小心地走向楼梯。她的脚步声被从前门一直延续到楼梯上的豪华地毯所吸收，楼梯右手边的一个小桌子上放着一台属于上个世纪的打字机，上面还插着一张白纸。真是个奇怪的装饰品（嗯，玩过游戏的都知道这个是做什么的啦…）。除此之外，宽敞的大厅里没有其他任何东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The solemn ticking of a grandfather clock filled the cool air, echoing off of shining black and white tiles. He was in a dining hall, the kind he'd only ever seen in movies about rich people. Like the front room, this one had an incredibly high ceiling and a second floor balcony, but it was also decorated with expensive-looking art and had an inset fireplace at the far end, complete with a coat of arms and crossed swords hung over the mantle. There didn't seem to be any way to get to the second floor, but there was a closed door to the right of the fireplace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chris lowered his weapon and started for the door, still awed by the wealth of the "abandoned" mansion that the S. T. A. R. S. had stumbled into. The dining room had polished red wood trim and expensive looking artwork on the beige stucco walls, surrounding a long wooden table that ran the length of the room. The table had to seat at least twenty, though it was only set for a handful of people. Judging from the dust on the lacy place mats, nothing had been served for weeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯握着枪朝门走去。毫无疑问，自己闯进的这间“被遗弃的别墅”绝对是奢华无比，这间宽敞的餐厅中的红木装饰以及挂在周围墙壁上的昂贵的艺术品，还有摆在餐厅中央的那条从屋子的一头一直伸到另一头的桌子都有力的证明了这一点。这张桌子至少能容纳二十个人一同用餐，不过从带着蕾丝花边的桌布上所堆积的灰尘来看，这里至少有好几周没有被使用过了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More importantly, why had Umbrella lied to Irons about its condition?</div>

<div class="line_en">He wrinkled his nose, frowning. There was a vague odor in the air, a faint scent of something unpleasant, something familiar. He stood in the doorway another moment, trying to place the smell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯皱着眉头，仔细闻了闻，隐约有股异臭。从那里传来的这股令人不快的气味他十分熟悉。克里斯就这样站在门口，脑海中回想起关于这股气味的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One summer when he was a kid, the chain had come off his bike when he'd been out on a ride with some friends. He'd ended up in a ditch about six inches away from a choice bit of roadkill, the dried-up, pulpy remains of what once might have been a woodchuck. Time and the summer heat had dissipated the worst of the stink, though what had remained had been bad enough. Much to the amusement of his buddies, he'd vomited his lunch all over the carcass, taken a deep breath, then puked again. He still remembered the sun-baked scent of drying rot, like thickly soured milk and bile; the same smell that lingered in the corridor now like a bad dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩提时代的某个夏日，他与朋友一同骑自行车时，忽然车链脱落下来，车子也因此翻到了水沟里。那时在自己眼睛与鼻子前就横着一堆好似肉酱的东西，那是一只土拨鼠被过往的汽车碾压而成的。那堆肉就那样暴露在空气与阳光中经过了很多天，于是散发出了最为恶心的气味，还记得当时自己把早饭都吐在了那堆肉块上。所以虽然刚才做了深呼吸，但空气中满是腐臭的气味令自己清晰地回想起那些往事，还有在夏日阳光照射下那堆腐肉所散发出的异臭，好像是变酸的牛奶与胆汁混合在一起散发出来的。而现在盘踞在走廊空气中的味道和那时一模一样，宛如噩梦一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reached the door and turned the knob slowly, listening for any sound of movement on the other side. He couldn't hear anything over the ticking of the old clock; it was set against the wall and each movement of the second hand reverberated hollowly, am-plified by the cavernous room.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door opened into one side of a narrow corridor, dimly lit by antique light fixtures. Chris quickly checked both directions. To the right was maybe ten meters of hardwood hall, a couple of doors across from him and a door at the end of the corridor. To the left, the hallway took a sharp turn away from where he stood, widening out. He saw the edge of a patterned brown run on the floor there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将门打开，一条狭窄的走廊在复古风格的照明设备的照耀下，隐隐约约地显现出来。克里斯警觉地看了看左右两侧，右侧的走廊大概有几十米长，斜对面有两扇门，另外在尽头处还有一扇。左侧距离克里斯所站位置不远处，走廊在那里向右转去。在那里的地上有一片被染成红色的点状痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With an easy tap the door swung inward, into a dim hall with green flecked wallpaper. A broad-shouldered man was standing not twenty feet away, half-hidden in shadow, his back to Chris. He turned around slowly, the careful shuffling of someone drunk or injured, and the smell that Chris had noticed before came off of the man in thick, noxious waves. His clothes were tattered and stained, the back of his head patchy with sparse, scraggly hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里斯轻轻地推开门，好像能够依稀看到对面的走廊中贴着绿色的壁纸。向前走了不到二十步远，一个有着宽厚肩膀的男子站在走廊中。看不到他的样子，因为他背对着克里斯。那个男人好像也觉察到自己的身后有人，于是慢慢地转过身来。他好像是喝醉了，不然就是受伤了，总之他的动作非常迟缓，走起路来也摇摆不定。随着他的转身，克里斯刚才闻到的那股腐臭威，忽然变得更加强烈了，如排山倒海般向他袭来。男子衣衫褴褛，头上的头发也十分稀疏。">查看中文翻译</div>
