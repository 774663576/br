<div class="line_en">For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in Maycomb County, autumn turned to winter that year. We had two weeks of the coldest weather since 1885, Atticus said. Mr. Avery said it was written on the Rosetta Stone that when children disobeyed their parents, smoked cigarettes and made war on each other, the seasons would change: Jem and I were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一年一反常态，秋天变成了冬天，连梅科姆县最有经验的预言家们都不了解其中的原因。有两个星期天气冷得出奇。阿迪克斯说，从1885年以来，天气从没有像那两周那么冷过。艾弗里先生说，埃及的罗塞塔碑上写着，要是小孩不听父母的话，抽烟或者斗殴的话，四季就会变化。杰姆和我心情沉重，感到内疚，因为气候反常和我们有关，使得邻居们不愉快，我们自已也不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Old Mrs. Radley died that winter, but her death caused hardly a ripple -- the neighborhood seldom saw her, except when she watered her cannas. Jem and I decided that Boo had got her at last, but when Atticus returned from the Radley house he said she died of natural causes, to our disappointment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老拉德利太太那年冬天死了。她的死没有引起人们注意——除了她给美人蕉浇水的时间外，左邻右舍们很少看见她。杰姆和我认为布·拉德利终于把她弄死了，但是，阿迪克斯从拉德利家回来时说，她是因年老而死的。这使我们感到扫兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was still touchous about us and the Radleys and it wouldn't do to push him any. Jem had a notion that Atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker. Jem had no firm basis for his ideas, he said it was merely a twitch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆叫我别再问了。他说阿迪克斯对我们和拉德利家的人还很敏感，再追问他没好处。杰姆总觉得阿迪克斯知道今年夏天那个晚上我们的活动并不仅仅局限于玩输一盘脱一件衣服的扑克牌游戏。杰姆这个想法没有很可靠的根据，他说，这只不过是偶尔的想法罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought she'd be warmer at her house. Atticus drove her home in the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">She must have seen my perplexity. She said, "Only thing I worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused. This whole neighborhood could have gone up. Mr. Avery'll be in bed for a week -- he's right stove up. He's too old to do things like that and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean and when Stephanie Crawford's not looking, I'll make him a Lane cake. That Stephanie's been after my recipe for thirty years, and if she thinks I'll give it to her just because I'm staying with her she's got another think coming."</div>
