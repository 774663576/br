<div class="line_en">Rape is one of the prime atrocities in the human repertoire. It combines pain, degradation, terror, trauma, the seizure of a woman's means of perpetuating life, and an intrusion into the makeup of her progeny. It is also one of the commonest of atrocities. The anthropologist Donald Brown includes rape in his list of human universals, and it has been chronicled in every age and place. The Hebrew Bible tells of an era in which the brothers of a raped woman could sell her to her rapist, soldiers were entitled by divine decree to ravish nubile captives, and kings acquired concubines by the thousands. Rape, we have seen, was also common in tribal Amazonia, Homeric Greece, medieval Europe, and England during the Hundred Years' War (in Shakespeare's account, Henry V warns a French village to surrender or else their "pure maidens [will] fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation"). Mass rape is a fixture in genocides and pogroms all over the world, including recent rampages in Bosnia, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is also common in the aftermath of military invasions, such as by the Germans in Belgium in World War I, the Japanese in China and the Russians in Eastern Europe in World War II, and the Pakistanis in Bangladesh during its war of independence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Brown notes that while rape is a human universal, so are proscriptions against rape. Yet one has to look long and hard through history and across cultures to find an acknowledgment of the harm of rape from the viewpoint of the victim. "Thou shalt not rape" is not one of the Ten Commandments, though the tenth one does reveal the status of a woman in that world: she is enumerated in a list of her husband's chattels, after his house and before his servants and livestock. Elsewhere in the Bible we learn that a married rape victim was considered guilty of adultery and could be stoned to death, a sentence that was carried over into Sharia law. Rape was seen as an offense not against the woman but against a man -- the woman's father, her husband, or in the case of a slave, her owner. Moral and legal systems all over the world codified rape in similar ways. Rape is the theft of a woman's virginity from her father, or of her fidelity from her husband. Rapists can redeem themselves by buying their victim as a wife. Women are culpable for being raped. Rape is a perquisite of a husband, seigneur, slave-owner, or harem-holder. Rape is the legitimate spoils of war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布朗注意到，强奸是人类的共性，因此禁止强奸也是人类的共性。不过，我们必须承认，纵观世界历史，很少有从受害者的角度认识强奸所造成的伤害。《十诫》中没有一条是“不准强奸”，虽然第十条提到了妇女在当时世界的地位：妻子列在夫家的财产清单上，名位在房产之后，在侍女和牲畜之前。《圣经》还告诉我们，已婚妇女遭到强暴，相当于她犯下通奸罪，可以被石刑处死，伊斯兰教法一直延续了这一传统。强奸不是被当作对女性的侵犯，而被认为是对男人——女子的父亲、丈夫或者主人（如果女子是奴隶的话）的冒犯。全世界的道德标准和法律制度对强奸的定义几乎一模一样。强奸，是从一位父亲那里盗窃女儿的童贞，或者是从一位丈夫那里夺走妻子的贞洁。施暴者可以通过买下受害者做自己的妻子来赎过。妇女要为被强奸而受惩罚。对于丈夫、领主、奴隶主和妓院老板来说，强奸是他们的特权。在战争中，强奸则是合理合法的战利品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When medieval European governments began to nationalize criminal justice, rape shifted from a tort against a husband or father to a crime against the state, which ostensibly represented the interests of women and society but in practice tilted the scales well toward the side of the accused. The fact that a false charge of rape is easy to make and hard to defend against was used to put an insuperable burden of proof onto the prosecutrix, as a rape victim was termed in many legal codes. Judges and lawyers sometimes claimed that a woman could not be forced into sex against her will because "you can't thread a moving needle." Police often treated rape as a joke, pressing the victim for pornographic details or dismissing her with wisecracks like "Who'd want to rape you?" or "A rape victim is a prostitute that didn't get paid." In court, the woman often found herself on trial together with the defendant, having to prove that she did not entice, encourage, or consent to her rapist. In many states women were not allowed to serve on juries for sex crimes because they might be "embarrassed" by the testimony. 38</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在中世纪的欧洲，当国家开始制定统一的刑法制度，强奸从对父亲或丈夫的侵权行为转变为对国家的犯罪；表面上看，政府代表了妇女的利益，但实际上，法律的天平一直向被告倾斜。因为控告虚假强奸易、为强奸辩护难这一事实，让人们将艰巨的举证负担全部压到强奸受害者的身上，在许多法规中将强奸受害者称为“女起诉人”［或“女原告”（prosecutrix）］。有时，法官和律师声称，一位女子不可能被强迫发生违反本人意愿的性交，因为“你不可能给一根晃动的针穿上线”。警察经常将强奸案当作玩笑，不是向受害人追问色情的细节，就是调侃受害人说“有谁会愿意强奸你呢？”或者“被强奸无非就是妓女没有拿到嫖客的钱”。在法庭上，妇女经常发现自己和被告一起受审，不得不证明自己没有挑逗、鼓励和同意强奸者。在许多国家，妇女不能担任性犯罪案件的陪审员，因为她们会为证词感到“难为情”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The prevalence of rape in human history and the invisibility of the victim in the legal treatment of rape are incomprehensible from the vantage point of contemporary moral sensibilities. But they are all too comprehensible from the vantage point of the genetic interests that shaped human desires and sentiments over the course of evolution, before our sensibilities were shaped by Enlightenment humanism. A rape entangles three parties, each with a different set of interests: the rapist, the men who take a proprietary interest in the woman, and the woman herself. 39</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从现代道德观念来看，人类历史上强奸之普遍和法制对强奸受害者之忽视是完全不可思议的。但在启蒙时代人文主义塑造新道德观念之前，从在人类进化中形成欲望和情感的遗传利益来看，强奸和对强奸的忽视又是那样顺理成章。强奸涉及三方，三方各有自己的利益：强奸者，与这个女子有特殊利害关系的男子和女子本人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Evolutionary psychologists and many radical feminists agree that rape is governed by the economics of human sexuality. As the feminist writer Andrea Dworkin put it, "A man wants what a woman has -- sex. He can steal it (rape), persuade her to give it away (seduction), rent it (prostitution), lease it over the long term (marriage in the United States) or own it outright (marriage in most societies)." What evolutionary psychology adds to this analysis is an explanation of the resource that backs these transactions. In any species in which one sex can reproduce at a faster rate than the other, the participation of the slower-reproducing sex will be a scarce resource over which the faster-reproducing sex competes. In mammals and many birds it is the female who reproduces more slowly, because she is committed to a lengthy period of gestation, and for mammals, lactation. Females are the more discriminating sex, and the males treat restrictions on their access to females as an obstacle to be overcome. Harassment, intimidation, and forced copulation are found in many species, including gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees. Among humans, the male may use coercion to get sex when certain risk factors line up: when he is violent, callous, and reckless by temperament; when he is a loser who cannot attract sexual partners by other means; when he is an outcast and has little fear of opprobrium from the community; and when he senses that the risks of punishment are low, such as during conquests and pogroms. Around 5 percent of rapes result in pregnancies, which suggests that rape can bring an evolutionary advantage to the rapist: whatever inclinations sometimes erupt in rape need not have been selected against in our evolutionary history, and may have been selected for. None of this, of course, implies that men are "born to rape," that rapists "can't help it," or that rape is "natural" in the sense of inevitable or excusable. But it does help explain why rape has been a scourge in all human societies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进化心理学家和许多激进女权主义者都认为，强奸受人类性行为的经济学所主导。正如女权主义作家安德烈娅·德沃金（Andrea Dworkin）所说，“一个男人想得到女人拥有的东西——性。他可以偷（强奸），可以请求索取（诱惑），可以租借（嫖妓），可以长期租赁（美国的婚姻），也可以彻底拥有（大部分社会中的婚姻）”。进化心理学家则对支撑这些交易的资源进行了分析。如果在一个物种的繁衍生育中，一个性别的生育速度快于另一个性别，生育较慢的性别就会成为较快一方竞争的稀缺资源。在哺乳动物和许多鸟类中，雌性的生育过程更缓慢，除了妊娠期，哺乳动物还有哺乳期。当雌性成为更有权挑剔的性别，接近雌性所受的限制就被雄性视为必须克服的障碍。在许多物种中，包括大猩猩、猩猩和黑猩猩，都能看到雄性对雌性的骚扰、恐吓和强迫交配。说到人类，当某些风险因素同时存在时，男性就有可能使用武力进行交配，这些因素是：他具有暴戾、残忍和冲动的性格；他作为失败者无法用其他方式吸引女性；他被排斥在集体之外，因此无须担忧在社群内的名誉；以及他意识到他不会为此受到惩罚的时候，比如在征服和迫害行动中。大约5%的强奸会导致怀孕，这说明强奸给强奸者带来进化优势：无论强奸表现出何种倾向性，人类进化的历史显然未曾淘汰这一行为，反而特别筛选留下了它。当然，所有这些都不是说男人“天性要进行强奸”，也不是说强奸犯对控制犯罪“无能为力”，或者说强奸因其不可避免或情有可原而属于“自然”现象。但是，这些能够帮助我们解释，为什么强奸是所有人类社会都能见到的一种瘟疫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second party to a rape is the woman's family, particularly her father, brothers, and husband. The human male is unusual among mammals in that he feeds, protects, and cares for his offspring and for their mother. But this investment is genetically risky. If a man's wife has a secret dalliance, he could be investing in another man's child, which is a form of evolutionary suicide. Any genes that incline him to be indifferent to the risk of cuckoldry will lose out over evolutionary time to genes that incline him to be vigilant. As always, genes don't pull the strings of behavior directly; they exert their influence by shaping the emotional repertoire of the brain, in this case, the emotion of sexual jealousy. Men are enraged at the thought of their partner's infidelity, and they take steps to foreclose that possibility. One step is to threaten her and her prospective partners and to enforce the threat when necessary to keep it credible. Another is to control her movements and her ability to use sexual signals to her advantage. Fathers too can display a proprietariness toward their daughters' sexuality that looks a lot like jealousy. In traditional societies, daughters are sold for a bride-price, and since a virgin is guaranteed not to be bearing another man's child, chastity is a selling point. Fathers, and to some extent brothers and mothers, may try to protect this valuable resource by keeping their girls chaste. The elder generation of women in a society also have an incentive to regulate the sexual competition from the younger one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="强奸还涉及受害女子的家庭，特别是她的父亲、兄弟和丈夫。在哺乳动物中，人类男性不同寻常之处在于他喂养、保护和关照他的子女和子女们的母亲。但是，从基因的角度看，这项投资颇具风险。如果这位男子的妻子有个秘密的情人，他就有可能在投资另一个男人的孩子；从进化上看，这无异于自杀。随着进化时间的推移，任何倾向于对妻子通奸无所谓的基因都会彻底败给那些对此保持高度警惕的基因。基因并不直接指挥人类的行为，它们通过塑造人头脑中的情感组成而发挥影响，在这里，这种情感就是性嫉妒。男人想到自己的性伴侣不忠就会怒火中烧，因此他要采取防范措施，尽可能地消除背叛的可能性。措施之一是威胁她和她潜在的情人，并在必要的时候将威胁付诸行动。措施之二是控制女子的行动，削弱她释放女性优势的能力。父亲在展示他们对女儿的所有权时，其表现看起来很像是嫉妒女儿的性能力。在某些传统社会，可以出售女儿换取聘礼，而处女是没有身怀其他男子血胤的保证，贞洁遂成为卖点。父亲，甚至兄弟和母亲，都会将家中女孩子的贞操视为珍贵的资源而加以守护。而年长的女性出于自己的利益，也有动力约束年轻女子的女性竞争力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, women as well as men are jealous of their partners, as a biologist would predict from the fact that men invest in their offspring. A man's infidelity brings the risk that his investment stream will be alienated by another woman and the children he has with her, and this risk gives his partner an incentive to keep him from straying. But the costs of a partner's infidelity are different for the two sexes, and accordingly a man's jealousy has been found to be more implacable, violent, and tilted toward sexual (rather than emotional) infidelity. In no society are women and in-laws obsessed with the virginity of grooms.</div>

<div class="line_en">The motives shaped by evolutionary interests do not translate directly into social practices, but they can impel people to lobby for laws and customs that protect those interests. The result is the widespread legal and cultural norms by which men recognize each other's right to control the sexuality of their wives and daughters. The human mind thrives on metaphor, and in the case of women's sexuality the recurring figure of thought is property. Property is an elastic concept, and laws in various societies have recognized the ownership of intangibles such as airspace, images, melodies, phrases, electromagnetic bandwidth, and even genes. It's no surprise, then, that the concept of property has also been applied to the ultimate in unpossessability: sentient humans with interests of their own, such as children, slaves, and women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遗传利益形成的动机不会直接进入社会实践，但是这些动机促使人们制定法规和确立习俗来保护这些利益。结果，男人们彼此承认各自有权控制妻女的性能力，成为世界各地都通行的法律和文化准则。人类的思维特别依赖形象的比喻，在女性的性能力这个问题上，最形象的比喻就是“财产”。财产是一个极有弹性的概念，各种不同的社会都有法律规范对无形资产的占有权，如领空、图像、曲调、短语、电磁频幅，甚至基因。所以，毫不奇怪，人们能够将财产的概念推向极端，强加在不可占有物的身上，即有感知有自身利益的人，如孩子、奴隶和妇女。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Men may also protect their investment by holding the woman strictly liable for any theft or damage of her sexual value.

<div class="line_en">In their article "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Chattel," Margo Wilson and Martin Daly have documented that traditional laws all over the world treat women as the property of their fathers and husbands. Property laws entitle owners to sell, exchange, and dispose of their property without encumbrance, and to expect the community to recognize their right to redress if the property is stolen or damaged by others. With the woman's interests unrepresented in this social contract, rape becomes an offense against the enfranchised men who own her. Rape was conceptualized as a tort for damaged goods, or as the theft of valuable property, as we see in the word rape itself, a cognate of ravage, rapacious, and usurp. It follows that a woman who was not under the protection of a highborn, propertied man was not covered by rape laws, and that the rape of a wife by her husband was an incoherent notion, like stealing one's own property.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though the more blatant tropes of the women-as-property metaphor were dismantled in the late Middle Ages, the model has persisted in laws, customs, and emotions into the recent present. Women, but not men, wear engagement rings to signal they are "taken," and many are still "given away" at their weddings by their fathers to their husbands, whereupon they change their surname accordingly. Well into the 1970s marital rape was not a crime in any state, and the legal system underweighted the interests of women in other rapes. Legal scholars who have studied jury proceedings have discovered that jurors must be disabused of the folk theory that women can be negligently liable for their own rapes -- a concept not recognized in any contemporary American code of law -- or it will creep into their deliberations. And in the realm of the emotions, husbands and boyfriends often find themselves cruelly unsympathetic to their partners after they have been raped, saying things like "Something has been taken from me. I feel cheated. She was all mine before and now she's not." It's not uncommon in the aftermath of a rape for a marriage to unravel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然将妇女作为财产的最肆无忌惮的比喻和修辞在中世纪末期就停止使用了，但直到最近，我们仍能在法律、习俗和情感中找到传统留下的范式。订婚后的女子（不是男子）戴订婚戒指，表示她们“被采纳”；许多新娘在婚礼上由父亲“交给”她们的丈夫，并改变姓氏。直到20世纪70年代，婚内强奸在任何地方都不算犯罪，司法系统很少关注强奸案中妇女的利益。研究陪审团判案程序的法学家们发现，陪审团仍然认为妇女要为自己被强奸承担疏于防护的责任，如果不提醒陪审团现代美国法律不接受这种概念，陪审团经常会根据这一民间理论做出不利女性受害人的裁决。至于感情方面的伤害，丈夫和男友往往毫不怜惜自己遭到强奸的伴侣，他们喜欢说：“我感到有什么东西永远失去了。我觉得被欺骗了。以前，她整个都是我的，但现在不再是这样了。”妇女因为被强奸而婚姻破裂的事例屡见不鲜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And finally we get to the third party to the rape: the victim. The same genetic calculus that predicts that men might sometimes be inclined to pressure women into sex, and that the victim's kin may experience rape as an offense against themselves, also predicts that the woman herself should resist and abhor being raped. It is in the nature of sexual reproduction that a female should evolve to exert control over her sexuality. She should choose the time, the terms, and the partner to ensure that her offspring have the fittest, most generous, and most protective father available, and that the offspring are born at the most propitious time. As always, this reproductive spreadsheet is not something that a woman calculates, either consciously or unconsciously; nor is it a chip in her brain that robotically controls her behavior. It is just the backstory of why certain emotions evolved, in this case, the determination of a woman to control her sexuality, and the agony of violation when it has been forcibly wrested from her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，我们要来看看强奸的第三方：受害者。出于同样的遗传计算，男人在有些情况下具有强迫女人交配的倾向；受害人的家族则认为强奸是对整个家族的挑衅，而妇女应该抗拒并憎恶被强奸。有性繁殖的性质决定了女性在演化中成为掌握性控制权的一方。她选择交配的时间、条件和伴侣，以保障子女尽可能得到最合适、最慷慨和最有保护能力的父亲，并在最合适的时间生育子女。但是，女性对生育的计算，不论有意还是无意，都不是一张会计报表，也不是她头脑里的一块芯片，可以机械地控制她的全部行为。这正是为什么人类在进化中生成某些情感背后的故事，即女性控制自己性事的决心，以及在受到暴力性侵犯后感受到剧烈伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>

And our current sensibilities, in which we recognize rape as a heinous crime against the woman, represent a reweighting of those interests, mandated by a humanist mindset that grounds morality in the suffering and flourishing of sentient individuals rather than in power, tradition, or religious practice. The mindset, moreover, has been sharpened into the principle of autonomy: that people have an absolute right to their bodies, which may not be treated as a common resource to be negotiated among other interested parties. 53Our current moral understanding does not seek to balance the interests of a woman not to be raped, the interests of the men who may wish to rape her, and the interests of the husband and fathers who want to monopolize her sexuality. In an upending of the traditional valuation, the woman's ownership of her body counts for everything, and the interests of all other claimants count for nothing. (The only tradeoff we recognize today is the interests of the accused in a criminal proceeding, since his autonomy is at stake too.) The principle of autonomy, recall, was also a linchpin in the abolition of slavery, despotism, debt bondage, and cruel punishments during the Enlightenment.</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea, seemingly obvious today, that rape is always an atrocity against the rape victim was slow in catching on. In English law there had been some rebalancing toward the interests of victims in the late Middle Ages, but only in the 18th century did the laws settle into a form that is recognizable today. Not coincidentally, it was also during that era, the age of Enlightenment, that women's rights began to be acknowledged, pretty much for the first time in history. In a 1700 essay Mary Astell took the arguments that had been leveled against despotism and slavery and extended them to the oppression of women:</div>

<div class="line_en">It took another 150 years for this argument to turn into a movement. The first wave of feminism, bookended in the United States by the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 and the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1920, gave women the right to vote, to serve as jurors, to hold property in marriage, to divorce, and to receive an education.

<div class="line_en">Much of the credit goes to a 1975 bestseller by the scholar Susan Brownmiller called Against Our Will. Brownmiller shone a harsh light on the historical indulgence of rape in religion, law, warfare, slavery, policing, and popular culture. She presented contemporary statistics on rape and first-person accounts of what it is like to be raped and to press charges of rape. And Brownmiller showed how the nonexistence of a female vantage point in society's major institutions had created an atmosphere that made light of rape (as in the common quip "When rape is inevitable you might as well lie back and enjoy it"). She wrote at a time when the decivilizing process of the 1960s had made violence a form of romantic rebellion and the sexual revolution had made lasciviousness a sign of cultural sophistication. The two affectations are more congenial to men than to women, and in combination they made rape almost chic. Brownmiller reproduced discomfitingly heroic portrayals of rapists in middlebrow and highbrow culture, together with cringe-inducing commentaries that assumed that the reader sympathized with them. Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film A Clockwork Orange, for example, featured a Beethoven-loving rapscallion who amused himself by beating people senseless and by raping a woman before her husband's eyes. A reviewer from Newsweek exclaimed:</div>

<div class="line_en">Today every level of the criminal justice system has been mandated to take sexual assaults seriously. A recent anecdote conveys the flavor of the change. One of my graduate students was walking in a working-class Boston suburb and was accosted on a sidewalk by three high school boys, one of whom grabbed her breast and, when she protested, jokingly threatened to hit her. When she reported it to the police, they assigned an undercover officer to conduct a stakeout with her, and the two of them spent three afternoons in an inconspicuous car (a 1978 salmon-colored Cadillac Seville, seized in a drug bust) until she spotted the perpetrator. The assistant district attorney met with her several times and with her consent charged him with second-degree assault, to which he pleaded guilty. Compared to the casual way that even brutal rapes had been treated in earlier decades, this mobilization of the judicial system for a relatively minor offense is a sign of the change in policies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Also changed beyond recognition is the treatment of rape in popular culture. Today when the film and television industries depict a rape, it is to generate sympathy for the victim and revulsion for her attacker. Popular television series like Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit drive home the message that sexual attackers at all social stations are contemptible scum and that DNA evidence will inevitably bring them to justice. Most striking of all is the video gaming industry, because it is the medium of the next generation, rivaling cinema and recorded music in revenue. Video gaming is a sprawling anarchy of unregulated content, mostly developed by and for young men. Though the games overflow with violence and gender stereotypes, one activity is conspicuous by its absence. The legal scholar Francis X.

<div class="line_en">But did any of these changes reduce the incidence of rape? The facts of rape are elusive, because rape is notoriously underreported, and at the same time often overreported (as in the highly publicized but ultimately disproven 2006 accusation against three Duke University lacrosse players). Junk statistics from advocacy groups are slung around and become common knowledge, such as the incredible factoid that one in four university students has been raped. (The claim was based on a commodious definition of rape that the alleged victims themselves never accepted; it included, for example, any incident in which a woman consented to sex after having had too much to drink and regretted it afterward.) An imperfect but serviceable dataset is the U. S. Bureau of Justice Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey, which since 1973 has methodically interviewed a large and stratified sample of the population to estimate crime rates without the distorting factor of how many victims report a crime to the police. The survey has several features that are designed to minimize underreporting. Ninety percent of the interviewers are women, and after the methodology was improved in 1993, adjustments were made retroactively to the estimates from earlier years to keep the data from all years commensurable. Rape was defined broadly but not too broadly; it included sexual acts coerced by verbal threats as well as by physical force, and it included rapes that were either attempted or completed, of men or of women, homosexual or heterosexual. (In fact, most rapes are man-on-woman.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，这些变化是否减少了强奸案？强奸的真实情况很不明朗，因为强奸案永远是被低估的，而同时又经常被虚报（比如2006年成为新闻热点的杜克大学三名曲棍球队队员被控强奸，但最后证明指控不实）。维权组织提供的统计毫无可信度，这已经是公认的事实，有些统计荒唐到说1/4的大学生被强奸过。（这个数字的根据是一个非常宽泛的强奸定义，甚至不需要受害人自己承认被强奸；包括所有妇女在醉后同意发生但过后又后悔了的性关系。）美国司法部统计局的《全国犯罪受害人调查》数据库虽然不完美，但是足供使用。统计局自1973年以来进行了大量的分层人口抽样调查，据此估算的犯罪率不受向警察局报案人数的限制。设计调查时特别考虑到了如何抵消犯罪报告不充分的问题。90%的受调查者是妇女。1993年调查方式改进之后，对过去的调查数据进行了统一调整，因此全部资料具有可比性。强奸的定义范围有所扩大，但又没有太离谱；除了身体的强制力之外，还包括了语言威胁强迫性性行为；既遂的和未遂的强奸；受害者的性别可以是女性也可以是男性，可以是同性恋也可以是异性恋。（事实上，大部分强奸是男性施于女性。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We learned in chapter 3 that the 1990s saw a decrease in all categories of crime, from homicide to auto theft. One might wonder whether the rape decline is just a special case of the crime decline rather than an accomplishment of the feminist effort to stamp out rape. In figure 7-10 I also plotted the murder rate (from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports), aligning the two curves at their 1973 values. The graph shows that the decline of rape is different from the decline of homicide. The murder rate meandered up and down until 1992, fell in the 1990s, and stayed put in the new millennium. The rape rate began to fall around 1979, dropped more steeply during the 1990s, and continued to bounce downward in the new millennium. By 2008 the homicide rate had hit 57 percent of its 1973 level, whereas the rape statistics bottomed out at 20 percent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Probably several causes pushed in the same direction. The portion of the downslope in the 1990s must share some causes with the general crime decline, such as better policing and fewer dangerous men on the streets. Before, during, and after that decline, feminist sensibilities had singled out rape for special attention by the police, courts, and social service agencies. Their effort was enhanced by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, which added federal funding and oversight to rape prevention, and underwrote the use of rape kits and DNA testing, which put many first-time rapists behind bars rather than waiting for a second or third offense. Indeed, the general crime decline in the 1990s may have been as much a product of the feminist antirape campaign as the other way around. Once the crime binge of the 1960s and 1970s had reached a plateau, it was the feminist campaign against assaults on women that helped to deromanticize street violence, make public safety a right, and spur the recivilizing process of the 1990s.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些原因的指向是相同的。90年代强奸率的下降显然符合当时的大趋势，导致各种犯罪率下降的原因必然有共同之处，比如更有效的治安管理，更多的犯罪分子被关进监狱。在犯罪大下降之前、期间和之后，女权运动将强奸作为运动的主攻方向，要求警方、法院和社会服务机构予以特别关注。1994年通过的《防止对妇女施暴法》提供了进一步防范强奸的措施，增加了联邦基金和监督机构，为强奸检测工具包和DNA测试提供资助。强奸检测工作将很多初犯强奸犯绳之以法，不让他们有进行下一次犯罪的机会。的确，可以说，90年代犯罪下降是女权分子反强奸运动的成果，反之亦成立。当60年代和70年代犯罪高潮终于开始放缓，女权分子反对性侵害的运动让街头暴力褪去了浪漫的光环，让公共安全成为一种权利，引发了90年代的社会改造进程。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though feminist agitation deserves credit for the measures that led to the American rape decline, the country was clearly ready for them. It was not as if anyone argued that women ought to be humiliated at police stations and courtrooms, that husbands did have the right to rape their wives, or that rapists should prey on women in apartment stairwells and parking garages. The victories came quickly, did not require boycotts or martyrs, and did not face police dogs or angry mobs. The feminists won the battle against rape partly because there were more women in positions of influence, the legacy of technological changes that loosened the age-old sexual division of labor which had shackled women to hearth and children. But they also won the battle because both sexes had become increasingly feminist.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite anecdote-driven claims that women have made no progress because of a "backlash" against feminism, data show that the country's attitudes have become inexorably more progressive. The psychologist Jean Twenge has charted more than a quarter of a century of responses to a standardized questionnaire about attitudes toward women which includes items such as "It is insulting to women to have the 'obey' clause remain in the marriage service," "Women should worry less about their rights and more about becoming good wives and mothers," and "A woman should not expect to go to exactly the same places or to have quite the same freedom of action as a man." Figure 7-11 shows the average of seventy-one studies that probed the attitudes of college-age men and women from 1970 to 1995. Successive generations of students, women and men alike, had increasingly progressive attitudes toward women. In fact, the men of the early 1990s had attitudes that were more feminist than those of the women in the 1970s. Southern students were slightly less feminist than northern ones, but the trends over time were similar, as are attitudes toward women measured in other samples of Americans.</div>

<div class="line_en">We are all feminists now. Western culture's default point of view has become increasingly unisex. The universalizing of the generic citizen's vantage point, driven by reason and analogy, was an engine of moral progress during the Humanitarian Revolution of the 18th century, and it resumed that impetus during the Rights Revolutions of the 20th. It's no coincidence that the expansion of the rights of women followed on the heels of the expansion of the rights of racial minorities, because if the true meaning of the nation's founding creed is that all men are created equal, then why not all women too? In the case of gender a superficial sign of this universalizing trend is the effort of writers toto avoid masculine pronouns such as he and him to refer to a generic human. A deeper sign is the reorienting of moral and legal systems so that they could be justified from a viewpoint that is not specific to men.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rapists are men; their victims are usually women. The campaign against rape got traction not only because women had muscled their way into power and rebalanced the instruments of government to serve their interests, but also, I suspect, because the presence of women changed the understanding of the men in power. A moral vantage point determines more than who benefits and who pays; it also determines how events are classified as benefits and costs to begin with. And nowhere is this gap in valuation more consequential than in the construal of sexuality by men and by women.</div>

<div class="line_en">In their book Warrior Lovers, an analysis of erotic fiction by women, the psychologist Catherine Salmon and the anthropologist Donald Symons wrote, "To encounter erotica designed to appeal to the other sex is to gaze into the psychological abyss that separates the sexes… The contrasts between romance novels and porn videos are so numerous and profound that they can make one marvel that men and women ever get together at all, much less stay together and successfully rear children." Since the point of erotica is to offer the consumer sexual experiences without having to compromise with the demands of the other sex, it is a window into each sex's unalloyed desires. Pornography for men is visual, anatomical, impulsive, floridly promiscuous, and devoid of context and character. Erotica for women is far more likely to be verbal, psychological, reflective, serially monogamous, and rich in context and character. Men fantasize about copulating with bodies; women fantasize about making love to people.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rape is not exactly a normal part of male sexuality, but it is made possible by the fact that male desire can be indiscriminate in its choice of a sexual partner and indifferent to the partner's inner life -- indeed, "object" can be a more fitting term than "partner." The difference in the sexes' conception of sex translates into a difference in how they perceive the harm of sexual aggression. A survey by the psychologist David Buss shows that men underestimate how upsetting sexual aggression is to a female victim, while women overestimate how upsetting sexual aggression is to a male victim. The sexual abyss offers a complementary explanation of the callous treatment of rape victims in traditional legal and moral codes. It may come from more than the ruthless exercise of power by males over females; it may also come from a parochial inability of men to conceive of a mind unlike theirs, a mind that finds the prospect of abrupt, unsolicited sex with a stranger to be repugnant rather than appealing. A society in which men work side by side with women, and are forced to take their interests into account while justifying their own, is a society in which this thick-headed incuriosity is less likely to remain intact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="强奸不是男性性欲的正常组成，但男性的欲望在选择性伙伴方面的无差异性，以及对性伙伴内心生活的无所谓，确实让强奸成为可能。所以，与其说是“伙伴”，不如说是性交“对象”。男女在性观念上的不同，可以转变为他们在看待性侵犯伤害方面的差异。心理学家戴维·巴斯（David Buss）所做的调查显示，男人倾向于低估性侵犯对女性受害人的伤害，而妇女则高估了性侵害对男性受害人的伤害。传统的法律系统和道德准则对强奸受害者异常严厉，性别鸿沟可以为这一现象提供某种解释。起因也许是男性统治者对女性拥有的粗暴权威，也可能是因为男子狭隘的智力，没有能力想象还有与自己不同的头脑，即在他们的异性看来，与陌生人发生突兀的、未经应允的性交非但没有吸引力，而且令人厌恶。在男性和女性并肩工作，必须为了自身利害而顾虑对方利益的社会中，男人这种对异性心理的麻木不仁不可能不发生变化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sexual abyss also helps to explain the politically correct ideology of rape. As we have seen, successful campaigns against violence often leave in their wake unexamined codes of etiquette, ideology, and taboo. In the case of rape, the correct belief is that rape has nothing to do with sex and only to do with power. As Brownmiller put it, "From prehistoric times to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear." Rapists, she wrote, are like Myrmidons, the mythical swarm of soldiers descended from ants who fought as mercenaries for Achilles: "Police-blotter rapists in a very real sense perform a myrmidon function for all men in our society." The myrmidon theory, of course, is preposterous. Not only does it elevate rapists to altruistic troopers for a higher cause, and slander all men as beneficiaries of the rape of the women they love, but it assumes that sex is the one thing that no man will ever use violence to attain, and it is contradicted by numerous facts about the statistical distribution of rapists and their victims. Brownmiller wrote that she adapted the theory from the ideas of an old communist professor of hers, and it does fit the Marxist conception that all human behavior is to be explained as a struggle for power between groups. But if I may be permitted an ad feminam suggestion, the theory that rape has nothing to do with sex may be more plausible to a gender to whom a desire for impersonal sex with an unwilling stranger is too bizarre to contemplate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="性别鸿沟也有助于解释有关强奸认识上的政治正确观点。我们已经看到，所有反暴力运动的成功经常包括重新估量原有的礼仪、观念和禁忌。就强奸而言，政治正确的信念是，强奸的要点不是性而是暴力。布朗米勒是这样说的：“从史前时期开始到现在，我相信，强奸的关键作用就是恐吓，是全体男性有意识地要将全体女性置于恐怖之中。”她还说，强奸犯，就像希腊神话中为阿喀琉斯打仗的雇佣军密尔弥冬，是一群蚂蚁变身的士兵，“在我们的社会中，警察记录中的强奸犯事实上是为全体男性服务的忠仆密尔弥冬”。当然，“密尔弥冬理论”是荒谬的。它不仅将强奸犯拔高为一个利他的战士，还污辱全体男性从他们所爱的女子被强奸中受益，而且，这个理论还假定“性”是性，暴力是暴力，“性”是一件男性从来不会以暴力获取的东西，而这与有关强奸犯和受害人的统计分布的大量事实相违背。布朗米勒说她是从一位老共产党教授那里接受了这一理论。这也的确符合马克思主义的理论，所有的人类行为都可以用集团之间的权力斗争来解释。但是，如果允许我提一个讨好女性的建议的话，说强奸与性无关的理论，在一个无法想象与不情不愿的陌生人发生性交的性别来看，确实有更大的可信性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Common sense never gets in the way of a sacred custom that has accompanied a decline of violence, and today rape centers unanimously insist that "rape or sexual assault is not an act of sex or lust -- it's about aggression, power, and humiliation, using sex as the weapon. The rapist's goal is domination." (To which the journalist Heather MacDonald replies: "The guys who push themselves on women at keggers are after one thing only, and it's not a reinstatement of the patriarchy.") Because of the sacred belief, rape counselors foist advice on students that no responsible parent would ever give a daughter. When MacDonald asked the associate director of an Office of Sexual Assault Prevention at a major university whether they encouraged students to exercise good judgment with guidelines like "Don't get drunk, don't get into bed with a guy, and don't take off your clothes or allow them to be removed," she replied, "I am uncomfortable with the idea. This indicates that if [female students] are raped it could be their fault -- it is never their fault -- and how one dresses does not invite rape or violence… I would never allow my staff or myself to send the message it is the victim's fault due to their dress or lack of restraint in any way."</div>

<div class="line_en">Domestic violence is the backstop in a set of tactics by which men control the freedom, especially the sexual freedom, of their partners. It may be related to the biological phenomenon of mate-guarding. In many organisms in which males invest in their offspring and females have opportunities to mate with other males, the male will follow the female around, try to keep her away from rival males, and, upon seeing signs that he may have failed, attempt to copulate with her on the spot. Human practices such as veiling, chaperoning, chastity belts, claustration, segregation by sex, and female genital cutting appear to be culturally sanctioned mate-guarding tactics. As an extra layer of protection, men often contract with other men (and sometimes older female kin) to recognize their monopoly over their partners as a legal right. Legal codes in the civilizations of the Fertile Crescent, the Far East, the Americas, Africa, and northern Europe spelled out almost identical corollaries of the equation of women with property. Adultery was a tort against the husband by his romantic rival, entitling him to damages, divorce (with refund of the bride-price), or violent revenge. Adultery was always defined by the marital status of the woman; the man's marital status, and the woman's own preferences in the matter, were immaterial. Well into the first decades of the 20th century, the man of the house was entitled by law to "chastise" his wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在男子用以控制他们配偶的自由，特别是性自由的各种手腕中，家暴是其中的杀手锏。这也许与“守护伴侣”这种生物现象有关联。在许多生物中，雄性对后代进行投资，雌性则有机会与其他雄性交配，雄性会到处追随刚刚与之交配过的雌性，不让她接触其他雄性，而一旦发现阻拦可能失败，雄性会试图当场与雌性交配。人类的一些实践，如面纱、陪伴、贞洁带、幽禁、男女隔离以及女子阴部割礼，都是男性“守护伴侣”策略在不同文化中的表现。为了再增加一层防护，男人经常和其他男人（有时也和年长的妇女）签约，确认他在法律上享有对配偶的垄断权力。新月沃地、远东、美洲、非洲和北欧等世界各个文明的法典毫无例外地将妇女排在财产之列。通奸是奸夫对丈夫的侵权行为，丈夫有权为此伤害配偶、离婚（女方家庭要退还新娘的聘礼）或者暴力复仇。通奸一向是单独由女方的婚姻状态来定义的，男性的婚姻状态和女子本人的偏好都无关紧要。即便在进入20世纪后，各国法律仍容许作为一家之主的男性“严惩”自己的妻子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Western countries the 1970s saw the repeal of many laws that had treated women as possessions of their husbands. Divorce laws became more symmetrical. A man could no longer claim justifiable provocation when he killed his adulterous wife or her lover. A husband could no longer forcibly confine his wife or prevent her from leaving the house. And a woman's family and friends were no longer guilty of the crime of "harboring" if they gave sanctuary to a fleeing wife. Most parts of the United States now have shelters in which women can escape from an abusive partner, and the legal system has recognized their right to safety by criminalizing domestic violence. Police who used to stay out of "marital spats" are now required by the laws of a majority of states to arrest a spouse if there is probable cause of abuse. In many jurisdictions prosecutors are obligated to seek protective orders that keep a potentially abusive spouse away from his home and partner, and then to prosecute him without the option of dropping the case, whether the victim wants it to proceed or not. Originally intended to rescue women who were trapped in a cycle of abuse, apology, forgiveness, and reoffending, the policies have become so intrusive that some legal scholars, such as Jeannie Suk, have argued that they now work against the interests of women by denying them their autonomy.</div>

As recently as 1972, the respondents to a survey of the seriousness of various crimes ranked violence toward a spouse 91st in a list of 140. (Respondents in that survey also considered the selling of LSD to be a worse crime than the "forcible rape of a stranger in the park.") Readers who distrust survey data may be interested in an experiment conducted in 1974 by the social psychologists Lance Shotland and Margaret Straw.

In a 1995 survey more than 80 percent of the respondents deemed domestic violence a "very important social and legal issue" (more important than children in poverty and the state of the environment), 87 percent believed that intervention is necessary when a man hits his wife even if she is not injured, and 99 percent believe that legal intervention is necessary if a man injures the wife. 79 Surveys that ask the same questions in different decades show striking changes. In 1987 only half of Americans thought it was always wrong for a man to strike his wife with a belt or stick; a decade later 86 percent thought it was always wrong. Figure 7-12 shows the statistically adjusted results of four surveys that asked people whether they approved of a husband slapping a wife. Between 1968 and 1994 the level of approval fell by half, from 20 to 10 percent. Though men are more likely to condone domestic violence than women, the feminist tide carried them along as well, and the men of 1994 were less approving than the women of 1968. The decline was seen in all regions of the country and in samples of whites, blacks, and Hispanics alike.</div>

<div class="line_en">What about domestic violence itself? Before we look at the trends, we have to consider a surprising claim: that men commit no more domestic violence than women. The sociologist Murray Straus has conducted many confidential and anonymous surveys that asked people in relationships whether they had ever used violence against their partners, and he found no difference between the sexes. In 1978 he wrote, "The old cartoons of the wife chasing her husband with a rolling pin or throwing pots and pans are closer to reality than most (and especially those with feminist sympathies) realize." Some activists have called for greater recognition of the problem of battered men, and for a network of shelters in which men can escape from their violent wives and girlfriends. This would be quite a twist. If women were never the victims of a gendered category of violence called "wife-beating," but rather both sexes have always been equally victimized by "spouse-beating," it would be misleading to ask whether wife-beating has declined over time as a part of the campaign to end violence against women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于家庭暴力本身的记录，在考虑整个大趋势之前，我们要先看一看一项惊人的声明：男性所犯的家暴和女性所犯的家暴差不多。社会学家默里·斯特劳斯做过很多保密和匿名的调查，他询问受调查者是否曾对配偶行使暴力，结果他发现男女之间没有区别。他在1978年时这样写道：“大部分人（特别是那些女权主义的同情者）都没有意识到，老动画片中妻子挥舞擀面杖追赶丈夫，或者将水壶铁锅扔到丈夫头上的场景是非常贴近现实的。”一些社会活动家已经在呼吁关注男人作为家暴受害者的问题，并呼吁为男人建立逃脱妻子和女友暴力的庇护中心。如果妇女从来都不是按性别分类的“殴打老婆”暴力的受害者，而是男女两性一向在同样程度上均为“殴打配偶”的受害者，我们单单说“打老婆”的下降是结束针对妇女的暴力社会运动的组成部分，就会让人产生误解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To make sense of the survey findings, one has to be careful about what one means by domestic violence. It turns out that there really is a distinction between common marital spats that escalate into violence ("the conversations with the flying plates," as Rodgers and Hart put it) and the systematic intimidation and coercion of one partner by another. The sociologist Michael Johnson analyzed data on the interactions between partners in violent relationships and discovered a cluster of controlling tactics that tended to go together. In some couples, one partner threatens the other with force, controls the family finances, restricts the other's movements, redirects anger and violence against the children or pets, and strategically withholds praise and affection. Among couples with a controller, the controllers who used violence were almost exclusively men; the spouses who used violence were almost entirely women, presumably defending themselves or their children. When neither partner was a controller, violence erupted only when an argument got out of hand, and in those couples the men were just a shade more prone to using force than the women. The distinction between controllers and squabblers, then, resolves the mystery of the genderneutral violence statistics. The numbers in violence surveys are dominated by spats between noncontrolling partners, in which the women give as good as they get. But the numbers from shelter admissions, court records, emergency rooms, and police statistics are dominated by couples with a controller, usually the man intimidating the woman, and occasionally a woman defending herself. The asymmetry is even greater with estranged partners, in which it is the men who do most of the stalking, threatening, and harming. Other studies have confirmed that chronic intimidation, serious violence, and maleness tend to go together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要理解这样的调查结果，我们必须很谨慎地解释什么是家庭暴力。关键是夫妻纠纷和由此升级形成的暴力（如罗杰斯和哈特所说的“对话中伴随着飞过来的盘子”），同配偶的一方习惯性地威胁和恐吓另一方，两者之间的界限在哪里。社会学家迈克尔·约翰逊（Michael Johnson）对有暴力问题的配偶之间的互动数据进行了分析，他发现，一套与控制欲有关的因素共同在起作用。有些夫妻中，发出暴力威胁的一方，同时也控制家庭的财政，限制另一方的行动，借故泄愤，打孩子或者打宠物，有意识地不流露任何赞许和爱慕的感情。在一方为控制者的夫妻中，暴力型的控制者几乎全部是男性；而配偶中使用暴力的女性，几乎无一例外是自我防卫和保护孩子。当夫妻双方均不属于控制型时，只有在争吵失控的时候才会发生暴力；这种情形下，男性暴力的水平略高于女性。控制者和吵闹者之间的区别解释了性别暴力统计上的谜案。暴力调查中的数字主要是非控制型配偶之间的纠纷，这样的家庭纠纷中男女行为相差不大。但根据庇护中心的登记资料、法庭记录、急救室和警察的统计，暴力主要来自夫妻中的控制型一方，通常是男人威胁妇女，有时候也有妇女进行自卫。在反目的伴侣中，男女暴力的不对称更加显著，一般总是男方对妇女实施追踪、威胁和伤害。其他研究已经证实，习惯性的恐吓和严重伤害主要是男性的行为。">查看中文翻译</div>

But with violence that is severe enough to count as an assault, so that it turns up in the National Crime Victimization Survey, the rates have plunged. As with estimates of rape, the numbers from a victimization study can't be treated as exact measures of rates of domestic violence, but they are useful as a measure of trends over time, especially since the new concern over domestic violence should make the recent respondents more willing to report abuse. The Bureau of Justice provides data from 1993 to 2005, which are plotted in figure 7-13.

In the years since the ascendancy of the women's movement, the chance that a man would be killed by his wife, ex-wife, or girlfriend has fallen sixfold. Since there was no campaign to end violence against men during this period, and since women in general are the less homicidal sex, the likeliest explanation is that a woman was apt to kill an abusive husband or boyfriend when he threatened to harm her if she left him. The advent of women's shelters and restraining orders gave women an escape plan that was a bit less extreme.</div>

<div class="line_en">What about the rest of the world? Unfortunately it is not easy to tell. Unlike homicide, definitions of rape and spousal abuse are all over the map, and police records are misleading because any change in the rate of violence against women can be swamped by changes in the willingness of women to report the abuse to the police. Adding to the confusion, advocacy groups tend to inflate statistics on rates of violence against women and to hide statistics on trends over time. The U. K. Home Office administers a crime victimization survey in England and Wales, but it does not present data on trends in rape or domestic violence. But when the data from separate annual reports are aggregated, as in figure 7-15, they show a dramatic decline in domestic violence, similar to the one seen in the United States. Because of differences in how domestic violence is defined and how population bases are tabulated, the numbers in this graph are not commensurable with those of figure 7-13, but the trends over time are almost the same. It is safe to guess that similar declines have taken place in other Western democracies, because domestic violence has been a concern in all of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Is the difference in violence against women between the West and the rest just one of the many wholesome factors that are bundled together in the Matthew Effect -- democracy, prosperity, economic freedom, education, technology, decent government? Not entirely. Korea and Japan are affluent democracies but have more domestic violence against women, and several Latin American countries that are far less developed appear to have more equal sex ratios and lower absolute rates. This leaves some statistical wiggle room to look for the differences across societies that make women safer, holding affluence constant. Archer found that countries in which women are better represented in government and the professions, and in which they earn a larger proportion of earned income, are less likely to have women at the receiving end of spousal abuse. Also, cultures that are classified as more individualistic, where people feel they are individuals with the right to pursue their own goals, have relatively less domestic violence against women than the cultures classified as collectivist, where people feel they are part of a community whose interests take precedence over their own. These correlations don't prove causation, but they are consistent with the suggestion that the decline of violence against women in the West has been pushed along by a humanist mindset that elevates the rights of individual people over the traditions of the community, and that increasingly embraces the vantage point of women.</div>

The pressure will come both from the top down and from the bottom up. At the top, a consensus has formed within the international community that violence against women is the most pressing human rights problem remaining in the world. There have been symbolic measures such as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women (November 25) and numerous proclamations from bully pulpits such as the United Nations and its member governments. Though the measures are toothless, the history of denunciations of slavery, whaling, piracy, privateering, chemical weaponry, apartheid, and atmospheric nuclear testing shows that international shaming campaigns can make a difference over the long run.

A 2010 survey by the Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Project of twenty-two countries found that in most of them, at least 90 percent of the respondents of both sexes believe that women should have equal rights, including the United States, China, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Lebanon, and countries in Europe and Latin America. Even in Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Kenya, more than 60 percent favor equal rights; only in Nigeria does the proportion fall just short of half. Support for women being allowed to work outside the home is even higher. And recall the global Gallup survey that showed that even in Islamic countries a majority of women believe that women should be able to vote as they please, work at any job, and serve in government, and that in most of the countries, a majority of the men agreed. As this pent-up demand is released, the interests of women are bound to be given greater consideration in their countries' policies and norms. The argument that women should not be assaulted by the men in their lives is irrefutable, and as Victor Hugo noted, "There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全世界的观念都在发生变化，在未来几年，妇女势必将获得更大的经济权利和政治权利。皮尤研究中心“全球态度调查项目”2010年对22个国家的一项调查发现，在大部分受调查国家中，包括美国、中国、印度、日本、韩国、土耳其、黎巴嫩，以及欧洲国家和拉美国家，至少有90%的男女受访者认为妇女应该拥有与男子平等的权利。甚至在埃及、约旦、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和肯尼亚，赞成男女平权的人也有60%，只有在尼日利亚，这个数字不到50%。有更多的人支持妇女离家工作。盖洛普全球调查显示，甚至在伊斯兰国家，大多数妇女相信只要妇女愿意，她们就应该有投票权，有工作机会，甚至在政府中任职；而在大部分伊斯兰国家，大多数男人对此亦表示同意。从妇女能够表达这点儿起码的要求开始，她们所在国家的政策和规则将会越来越多地顾及妇女的权益。男子不应以暴力伤害女子的生命，这一论点在今天已经不容争辩，正如雨果所说：“当一种观念成为时代的浪潮，其来势必不可阻挡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
