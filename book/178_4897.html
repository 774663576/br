<div class="line_en">"I wish I had a stone for the knife," the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the oar butt. "I should have brought a stone." You should have brought many things, he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is not time to think of what you do not have. Think of what you can do with what there is. "You give me much good counsel," he said aloud. "I'm tired of it." He held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我真希望有一块石头好磨刀，」老人检查过桨柄上的绳子之后，他说。「我应该带块石头来的，」他想。该带的东西可多呢，老头子，你什么都没有带来。但现在不是想该带什么东西的时候，倒是应该想一想，如何利用现有的东西。「你给了我很多很好的建议，」他大声地说。「可是，我已经厌烦了。」小船继续往前航行着，他把舵柄夹在手臂下面，双手泡在水中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a mirror and his stripes still showed. "I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish," he said. "Neither for you nor for me, I'm sorry, fish." Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it had been cut. Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一时再也说不出话来了，也不愿意再多看鱼一眼。它的血滚滚地流，海水一边将它的身体洗成像镜子后面的那种银色，而它身上的条纹却依然清晰可见。「我不应该划得这么远，鱼啊！」他说。「对你、对我都不应该。鱼啊！我实在很抱歉。」现在他对自己说：看看捆刀子的绳子是不是断了，然后叫你的手准备好，因为还有更多的鲨鱼马上就要来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man reversed the oar and put the blade between the shark's jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said, "Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or maybe it's your mother." The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course. "They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat," he said aloud. "I wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish. It makes everything wrong."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人把桨颠倒过来，把桨片插向鲨鱼的上下额之间，撬开它们。当他扭转桨片时，鲨鱼渐渐松了嘴，他说：「滚开，虎鲨！回到一哩深的地方去。去找你的朋友吧，或你妈妈吧。」老人把刀子的刃部擦干净，把桨放下来，之后他又找到了帆脚索，风再度把帆鼓起，将小船带回它的航道。「那条鱼的身体一定有四分之一惨遭掠夺了，而且还是最好的肉，」他大声地说：「但愿这是一场梦，但愿我没钓到这条鱼。鱼啊！我为你现在的遭遇感到痛心，它扰乱了一切。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Besides they do not bleed much. There is nothing but that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from cramping. What can I think of now? He thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for the next ones. I wish it and really been a dream, he thought. But who knows It might have turned out well. The next shark that came was a single shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且手上的血也流得不多。流点血没什么大不了，但却又意义非凡，因为流血可以避免左手抽筋。现在我能想什么呢？他想。什么也不能想，我必须什么也不想，等着下一群鲨鱼。但愿这一切是个梦，他想。但是谁知道？也许会有一个好结局也说不定。接下来，来的是一只铲鼻鲨，它像一只猪冲向食槽一样地来到，而猪若是张大了嘴的话，一个人的头都可以放进去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"God knows how much that last one took," he said. "But she's much lighter now." He did not want to think of the mutilated under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea. He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought. Don't think of that. Just rest and try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「只有上帝才知道，后面那只鲨鱼到底抢走了多少肉，」他说。「不过可以确定小船现在轻多了。」他不愿想象鱼腹下面残缺的样子。他晓得，鲨鱼每次摇摆猛扯的时候，就是大鱼被撕走一块肉的时候，而现在，那条鱼就像为所有的鲨鱼在它肚下开了一条好比一条公路那么宽的海中通道。他想，这条鱼可以供一个人度过整个冬天啊，不要再想了。好好地休息，把你的手调养好，以便保护剩下的那一部分。我手上的这一点血腥味比起水中的血腥味来说，简直是微不足道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man let him hit the fish and then drove the knife on the oar down into his brain. But the shark jerked backwards as the rolled and the knife blade snapped. The old man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it now. "I have the gaff now," he said. "But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the tiller and the short club." 老人先让它咬住大鱼,然后用捆绑着刀的桨往它的脑部刺去.然而当鲨鱼扭转着身体猛然往后退时,刀叶突然间断了.老人坐定下来,把着舵.他完全没去注意水中慢慢往下沉的鲨鱼,当鲨鱼下沈时起先可以看到的是它身体实际的长度,然后慢慢变小了,最后变成一丁点.这种事情原本是很吸引老人的.但是,此刻他却连看都不愿意看一眼.「现在我还有鱼叉,」他说.「可是却没有什么用.不过我还有两把桨、舵柄和短棍.」</div>

<div class="line_en">The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water. They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff swimming side by side. He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the stern for the club. It was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length. He could only use it effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were both galanos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人看见棕色的鳍沿着大鱼在水中所形成的一条血路游过来。它们对一路上的血腥味毫无眷恋，而直接一股脑地并肩朝小船游过来。他把舵柄夹紧，固定好帆脚索，然后伸向船尾拿短棍。那是从一把断桨上锯下来的把手，约有两尺半长。由于把手部分不太好抓，只能以单手操作，他就用右手紧紧握住，手指在上面弯曲扭动地热身，眼睛则盯着鲨鱼游过来。这两条都是虎鲨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller. He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there have been, and soon he hoped that he would see land. "You're tired, old man," he said. "You're tired inside." The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，我已经被打败了，他想。我太老了，没办法用棍子打死鲨鱼。但是只要我还有桨、短棍和舵柄，我都要再试一试。他又把双手泡在水中。现在已经是下午，接近傍晚的时刻，除了海洋和天空，他什么也没看见。现在风比原先大一些，他希望很快就能看到陆地。「老头子，你累了，」他说：「你的内心疼痛不堪。」就在太阳正要落下之前，鲨鱼才又来袭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness. "Come on, galano," the old man said. "Come in again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一条鲨鱼一直忽远忽近地徘徊在大鱼身边，现在张大着嘴又靠了过来。当它冲向大鱼咬了一口，阖上嘴的那一刻，老人看见一块块白色的鱼肉从它嘴角掉落下来。他挥着木棍朝它头上打，鲨鱼望着他，仍然把肉撕下来。当它溜到一旁，准备吞下那块肉的时候，老人再次用木棍挥打它，感觉上却像是在打厚如橡皮的东西。「来吧！虎鲨。」老人说：「再过来吧！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across the top of the head, he thought. The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark's broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我必须在第一条鲨鱼紧紧咬住大鱼之后，从它鼻尖上或头顶正中央刺下去，他想。两条鲨鱼同时包围了上来，他看见靠近的那一条张开大大嘴，将下巴埋入大鱼银色的腹部里，他高高举起棍子，狠狠地打下去，碰的一声落在鲨鱼宽宽的头顶上。木棍落下来的时候，他感觉它的头像橡皮似地那么坚实。但他也感觉到了它那冰冷僵硬的鱼骨。当鲨鱼从大鱼身上滑下来时，他又朝它鼻尖重重地击了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought. He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed. The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks. "It will be dark soon," he said. "Then I should see the glow of Havana. If I am too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我别想能够杀死它们，他想。当我年轻力壮时才能这样希望。不过，至少现在我也已经让它们两个都伤势惨重了，它们俩都不会感到太好受的。如果，我能用两只手握着棍子的话，说不定早就打死了第一条鲨鱼。他想，既使是现在，还是可以办到的。他不愿意看那大鱼一眼，他晓得，已毁掉一半了。而当他正在跟两条鲨鱼搏斗的时候，太阳已经落下去了。「天很快就要天黑了，」他说。「我将会看到哈瓦那的亮光，而如果我已经太偏东的话，我会看到新海滩上的一些灯火。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town. He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly. Then something came into his head. "Half fish," he said. "Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在离岸不会太远了，他心想。我希望没有人为我太过担忧。当然，只有那小男孩会为我担忧，但是我相信他对我有信心。可能很多年长的渔夫也会担心。还有其它的人也会，他想。我住在一个敦亲睦邻的优良小镇里。因为鱼实在毁损得太严重，他不能够再跟鱼讲话了。于是，他的脑子里产生了一个念头。「你这半条鱼啊！」他说：「你曾经是条完整的鱼，我真悔恨出海那么远，把我们两个都毁了。但是我们也杀了很多条鲨鱼，你和我一起杀的，而且还伤了很多条哩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish. The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲨鱼猛然间冲过来，当它又闭起嘴咬着鱼肉的时候，老人又敲了它一下。他使尽所有力气地把木棍尽量举高，着实地打下去。这一次他觉得打到它脑下的脑骨了，当鲨鱼有气无力地撕下一块肉，从鱼身上退下来的时候，老人又在同一个位置打了一下。老人注视着它，等着它再来，但是两条鲨鱼都没有再出现。然后，他看见一条鲨鱼在水面转圈圈，但没有看到另一条鲨鱼的鳍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How many did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing." He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no hatchet and then there was no knife. But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you do? "Fight them," he said. "I'll fight them until I die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老母鱼啊！你曾经杀害过多少鱼呢？看来你头上的那个长矛并不光是好看而已的呀。」他喜欢去想那条鱼，假想它可以自由自在地游动的话，会是如何地对付鲨鱼。他心想，我刚才应该把它长长的尖嘴砍下来，当作与那些鲨鱼搏斗的武器。可是船上没有斧头，也没有这么大的刀。假使我这么做了的话，便可以把它绑在桨杆上，那将会是多么犀利的武器啊。那样的话，我们或许可以并肩作战。假使它们今晚又来的话，你会怎么办？你能怎么办？「和它们搏斗，」他说：「我将和它们搏斗直到死为止。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead. His shoulders told him. I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是现在处于黑暗中，看不见亮光，也看不见灯火，只有风，和稳定拖曳着的帆，他感觉自己或许已经死了。他把双手合在一起，感觉一下掌心。他只要把手张开又合拢，就可以感到生命的痛楚，他的手并没有死，他靠着船尾倾着身体，便知道自己并没有死。那是他的肩膀告诉他的。他想起来：我已经许了愿，如果让我捕到这条鱼，就要念所有的祈祷文。但是我现在太疲倦了，没办法念。我还是把布袋拿来披在肩膀上吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have half of him, he thought. Maybe I'll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside. "Don't be silly," he said aloud. "And keep awake and steer. You may have much luck yet." "I'd like to buy some if there's any place they sell it," he said. What could I by it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken knife and two bad hands?
