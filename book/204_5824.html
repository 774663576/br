<div class="line_en">The dream embraced thousands of years and left in me only a sense of the whole. I only know that I was the cause of their sin and downfall. Like a vile trichina, like a germ of the plague infecting whole kingdoms, so I contaminated all this earth, so happy and sinless before my coming. They learnt to lie, grew fond of lying, and discovered the charm of falsehood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, at first perhaps it began innocently, with a jest, coquetry, with amorous play, perhaps indeed with a germ, but that germ of falsity made its way into their hearts and pleased them. Then sensuality was soon begotten, sensuality begot jealousy, jealousy -- cruelty…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唉，起初他们也许本无邪念只是出于戏谑、卖弄、好玩，也许真有点儿动心，可是这一动心竟深入心底，正合他们的心意。随后就出现了淫欲，淫欲滋生忌妒，忌妒导致残暴……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oh, I don't know, I don't remember; but soon, very soon the first blood was shed. They marvelled and were horrified, and began to be split up and divided.

<div class="line_en">The conception of honour sprang up, and every union began waving its flags. They began torturing animals, and the animals withdrew from them into the forests and became hostile to them. They began to struggle for separation, for isolation, for individuality, for mine and thine. They began to talk in different languages. They became acquainted with sorrow and loved sorrow; they thirsted for suffering, and said that truth could only be attained through suffering.</div>

<div class="line_en">They answered me: "We may be deceitful, wicked and unjust, we know it and weep over it, we grieve over it; we torment and punish ourselves more perhaps than that merciful Judge Who will judge us and whose Name we know not. But we have science, and by the means of it we shall find the truth and we shall arrive at it consciously. Knowledge is higher than feeling, the consciousness of life is higher than life. Science will give us wisdom, wisdom will reveal the laws, and the knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than happiness."</div>

<div class="line_en">Slavery followed, even voluntary slavery; the weak eagerly submitted to the strong, on condition that the latter aided them to subdue the still weaker. Then there were saints who came to these people, weeping, and talked to them of their pride, of their loss of harmony and due proportion, of their loss of shame. They were laughed at or pelted with stones. Holy blood was shed on the threshold of the temples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，出现了奴役，甚至是自愿的奴役：弱者甘心屈服于强者，以便强者帮助他们去压迫更弱者。出现了贤达之士。贤达挥泪进谏，——数说他们妄自尊大、肆无忌惮、失却和谐以及寡廉鲜耻。贤达遭到嘲讽和打击，他们的鲜血洒在圣殿的门上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Regular wars sprang up over this idea. All the combatants at the same time firmly believed that science, wisdom and the instinct of self-preservation would force men at last to unite into a harmonious and rational society; and so, meanwhile, to hasten matters, "the wise" endeavoured to exterminate as rapidly as possible all who were "not wise" and did not understand their idea, that the latter might not hinder its triumph. But the instinct of self-preservation grew rapidly weaker; there arose men, haughty and sensual, who demanded all or nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了这一理想，爆发了一次又一次的战争。所有参战者这时都坚信，学问、智慧和自我保全意识，最终必将使人们联结成为一个和睦共处、有理性的社会，而眼下为了加快事业的进程，“智者”在竭力尽快把“愚人”和不了解他们理想的人全都消灭，以免妨碍理想的实现。但是，自我保全意识开始迅速减弱，出现了骄横者和贪淫者，他们公然要求占有一切或抛弃一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That is what they said, and after saying such things everyone began to love himself better than anyone else, and indeed they could not do otherwise. All became so jealous of the rights of their own personality that they did their very utmost to curtail and destroy them in others, and made that the chief thing in their lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alas! I always loved sorrow and tribulation, but only for myself, for myself; but I wept over them, pitying them. I stretched out my hands to them in despair, blaming, cursing and despising myself. I told them that all this was my doing, mine alone; that it was I had brought them corruption, contamination and falsity. I besought them to crucify me, I taught them how to make a cross. I could not kill myself, I had not the strength, but I wanted to suffer at their hands. I yearned for suffering, I longed that my blood should be drained to the last drop in these agonies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唉，我老是喜欢灾难和痛苦，但只是为了自我担待，而对于他们我怜悯得痛哭流涕。我祈求他们原谅，我无限自责、自咒和自我鄙薄。我对他们说，这一切都是我干的，是我一个人干的；是我给他们带来了伤风败俗、道德沦丧与弄虚作假，我恳求他们把我钉在十字架上，我教他们做十字架。我不能，也无力自杀，但我情愿接受他们的折磨，我渴望痛苦，渴望在痛苦中洒尽我最后的一滴血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I moved about among them, wringing my hands and weeping over them, but I loved them perhaps more than in old days when there was no suffering in their faces and when they were innocent and so lovely.

<div class="line_cn" title="我痛心疾首地来到他们中间，为他们惋惜，不过，我也许比过去更爱他们，那时他们的脸上还没有痛苦，他们还是纯洁、美丽的。他们的这块土地原本是天堂，而今被他们玷污了，有了灾难，我才更爱它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In order to obtain everything they resorted to crime, and if they did not succeed -- to suicide. There arose religions with a cult of non-existence and self-destruction for the sake of the everlasting peace of annihilation.

They glorified suffering in their songs.</div>

I lifted up my hands and called upon eternal truth, not with words, but with tears; ecstasy, immeasurable ecstasy flooded my soul. Yes, life and spreading the good tidings! Oh, I at that moment resolved to spread the tidings, and resolved it, of course, for my whole life. I go to spread the tidings, I want to spread the tidings -- of what? Of the truth, for I have seen it, have seen it with my own eyes, have seen it in all its glory.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瞧，我现在把一切都弄清楚了，不过，请听我说：谁能不出错呢！然而要知道，上至圣贤，下至盗匪，大家起码都朝着同一方向，奔向同一目标，只是各人的路子不同而已。这是一个古老的真理，不过，这里也有新情况：我不可能完全糊涂，因为我看到了真理，我看出并且知道，人是会变得美丽、幸福，不会丧失生存能力的。">查看中文翻译</div>
