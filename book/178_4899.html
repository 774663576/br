<div class="line_en">The boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw the old man's hands and he started to cry. He went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and all the way down the road he was crying. Many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line. The boy did not go down. He had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff for him. "How is he?" one of the fishermen shouted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sleeping," the boy called. He did not care that they saw him crying. "Let no one disturb him." "He was eighteen feet from nose to tail," the fisherman who was measuring him called. "I believe it," the boy said. He went into the Terrace and asked for a can of coffee. "Hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it." "Anything more?" "No. Afterwards I will see what he can eat." "What a fish it was," the proprietor said. "There has never been such a fish. Those were two fine fish you took yesterday too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「正在睡，」小孩喊着。他一点都不在意别人看见他在哭泣。「大家都别去打扰他。」「由鼻子到尾巴共十八呎长，」刚才量鱼骨头的那位渔夫叫着。「我相信。」男孩说。他跑到露天酒店要了一罐咖啡。「要热一点，多加一点牛奶和糖。」「还要别的东西吗？」「不了，待会我看看他能吃得下什么再说吧。」「好大的一条鱼啊！」这老板说。「这里从来没有过这么大的一条鱼。你昨天钓到的那两条鱼也很不错啊。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't sit up," the boy said. "Drink this." He poured some of the coffee in a glass. The old man took it and drank it. "They beat me, Manolin," he said. "They truly beat me." "He didn't beat you. Not the fish." "No. Truly, It was afterwards." "Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the head?" "Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps." "And the spear?" "You keep it if you want it." "I want it," the boy said. "Now we must make our plans about the other things." "Did they search for me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「别坐起来，」男孩说，「把这个喝掉。」他倒了一点咖啡在杯子里头。老人接过去，喝了下去。「它们把我打败了，马洛林。」他说，「它们确确实实地把我打败了。」「它并没有打败你，鱼不可能打败你。」「不对，是真的把我打败了。那是在捕到它之后。」派德瑞克正在看守着那条小船和船具。「你打算怎么处置那鱼头呢？」「叫派德瑞克把它砍下来，放在捕鱼具里面捕鱼。」「那如长矛的鱼嘴呢？」「如果你要的话，就送给你。」「我要！」这男孩说。「现在我们该为其它事情计划一下了。」「他们有没有到处在找我？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Damn my fish," the boy said and he started to cry again. "Do you want a drink of any kind?" the proprietor asked. "No," the boy said. "Tell them not to bother Santiago. I'll be back." "Tell him how sorry I am." "Thanks," the boy said. The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man's shack and sat by him until he woke. Once it looked as though he were waking. But he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee. Finally the old man woke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我那两条鱼，真他妈的，」小男孩说，然后他又开始哭泣。「你要不要喝点什么东西？」老板问。「不，」男孩说。「告诉他们不要去打扰山帝雅哥，我会再回来的。」「告诉他，我为他感到深深的惋惜。」「谢谢！」男孩说。小孩拿了一罐热咖啡来到老人的木屋，坐在他的旁边，等着他醒来。曾经有一度，他看起来好像已经醒过来了，但却又马上沉沉睡去。男孩跑过马路，去借了一点木材，热一热咖啡。现在，终于老人醒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course. With coast guard and with planes." "The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see," the old man said. He noticed how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea. "I missed you," he said. "What did you catch?" "One the first day. One the second and two the third." "Very good." "Now we fish together again." "No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore." "The hell with luck," the boy said. "I'll bring the luck with me." "What will your family say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「当然啦！海岸警卫队都出动了，还用飞机来搜救。」「海洋太大，船又太小了，所以很难看到。」老人说。他现在感到好高兴，有个人可和他讲讲话，他不必对着海说话或自言自语了。「我想你，」他说。「你捕到了什么？」「第一天捕到一条，第二天捕到一条，第三天捕到两条。」「好极了。」「现在我们又可以一起去捕鱼了。」「不，我太倒霉了。我的运气不会再好了。」「管他妈的什么运气，」男孩说，「我会给你带来好运的。」「你的家人会怎么说呢？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have much to learn." "We must get good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke." "I'll get another knife and have the spring ground. How many days of heavy breeze have we?" "Maybe three. Maybe more." "I will have everything in order," the boy said. "You get your hands well old man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我才不管这些，我昨天捕到了两条鱼，而从现在开始我们要一起去捕鱼，因为我还有好多东西要向你学呢。」「我们必须弄一个锋利的长矛，把它一直放在船舱里面。你可以从旧的福特汽车里找一个弹簧叶片，把它做成一把刀。我们可以拿到瓜那巴可那里去磨。一定要很利才行，而且不可以用火去烧炼，否则很容易断裂。我的刀，就是这么断的。」「我再去弄把刀，把弹簧磨一磨。这种风还会吹几天呢？」「也许三天，也许更久。」「我会把一切都准备好的，」男孩说。「老先生你先把你的手调养好再说吧。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt something in my chest was broken." "Get that well too," the boy said. "Lie down, old man, and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat." "Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone," the old man said. "You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me everything. How much did you suffer?" "Plenty," the old man said. "I'll bring the food and the papers," the boy said. "Rest well, old man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我知道该怎么样治疗手。昨天晚上我吐了一些奇怪的东西，觉得胸口好像有什么东西破了似的。」「你要把它调养好，」男孩说。「老先生，你躺下，我去把你那件干净的衬衫拿来，然后再带一些吃的东西来。」「顺便带几张我不在这里的期间的报纸来，」老人说。「你一定要快快复元，因为我还有好多东西要向你学，你好把一切东西都教给我。你到底受了多少苦啊？」「太多了，」老人说。「我会把食物和报纸带来，」男孩说。「好好休息，老先生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I will bring stuff from the drugstore for your hands." "Don't forget to tell Pedrico the head is his." "No. I will remember." As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again. That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我会至药房里弄点东西给你擦手。」「别忘了告诉派德瑞克，鱼头是给他的。」「不会的，我会记得。」男孩出了门，顺着那碎珊瑚礁铺成的路上走去，泪水又涌出他的眼睛。那天下午露天酒店里来了一群观光客，一个女人从水中那一堆空啤酒罐和死梭鱼之间，望见了一根又大又长的白色背脊骨，以及一个硕大的尾巴。东风吹着，海港外面的风浪很大，庞大的鱼尾巴随着潮水起伏漂动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's that?" she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide. "Tiburon," the waiter said. "Eshark." He was meaning to explain what had happened. "I didn't know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails." "I didn't either," her male companion said. Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about the lions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「那是什么啊！」她问酒店的侍者，手指着大鱼长长的背脊，现在已变成了垃圾，等着潮水把它们带走。「大鲨鱼，」侍者发音不准地回答。「是一只鲨鱼，」他是想把一切的经过情形描述一下。「我还真不晓得鲨鱼有这么雄伟，形状这么美丽的尾巴呢。」「我也不晓得，」他的男伴说。顺路而上，小木屋里，老人又沉沉地睡去。他依然脸朝下地睡，男孩就坐在他身边守候。此刻，老人又梦见了狮子。">查看中文翻译</div>
