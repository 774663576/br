<div class="line_en">The dancers shimmered, their sleek shaved bodies covered with a fine sheen of oil. Blazing torches whirled from hand to hand to the beat of drums and the trilling of a flute. Whenever two torches crossed in the air, a naked girl leapt between them, spinning. The torchlight shone off oiled limbs and breasts and buttocks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Are they meant to inflame me? Dany stirred amongst her silken cushions. Against the pillars her Unsullied stood like statues in their spiked caps, their smooth faces expressionless. Not so the whole men. Reznak mo Reznak's mouth was open, and his lips glistened wetly as he watched. Hizdahr zo Loraq was saying something to the man beside him, yet all the time his eyes were on the dancing girls. The Shavepate's ugly, oily face was as stern as ever, but he missed nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The three men were erect. The sight of their arousal was arousing, though Daenerys Targaryen found it comical as well. The men were all of a height, with long legs and flat bellies, every muscle as sharply etched as if it had been chiseled out of stone. Even their faces looked the same, somehow… which was passing strange, since one had skin as dark as ebony, while the second was as pale as milk, and the third gleamed like burnished copper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个男人直了，眼睛发出兴奋的光芒，然而丹妮莉丝？坦格利安却觉得这很滑稽。他们都很高大，长腿平肚，每一块肌肉都高高贲起，好像石头上的凿刻。甚至他们的脸看起来都没有差别，不过…有种怪异的感觉掠过，因为一个皮肤黑如乌木，而第二个却苍白如牛奶，第三个又像磨光的铜币。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the drums reached a crescendo, three of the girls leapt above the flames, spinning in the air. The male dancers caught them about the waists and slid them down onto their members. Dany watched as the women arched their backs and coiled their legs around their partners while the flutes wept and the men thrust in time to the music. She had seen the act of love before; the Dothraki mated as openly as their mares and stallions. This was the first time she had seen lust put to music, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着鼓声渐次加强，三个少女在空中旋转着跳跃火焰上方。男性舞者从腰部接住她们，顺势传给他们的同伴。丹妮发现，每当长笛响起，少女们都弓起背、卷起腿环住她们的搭档，而且男性舞者跟着音乐及时地插入她们。她以前见到过性爱表演，多斯拉克人的结合总是在光天化日之下，就和他们的母马和公马一样。然而，这种把音乐加入其中的，她还是第一次看到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his honor Daenerys had donned a Qartheen gown, a sheer confection of violet samite cut so as to leave her left breast bare. Her silver-gold hair brushed lightly over her shoulder, falling almost to her nipple. Half the men in the hall had stolen glances at her, but not Xaro. It was the same in Qarth. She could not sway the merchant prince that way. Sway him I must, however. He had come from Qarth upon the galleas Silken Cloud with thirteen galleys sailing attendance, his fleet an answered prayer. Meereen's trade had dwindled away to nothing since she had ended slavery, but Xaro had the power to restore it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了以示尊敬，丹妮莉丝穿上一件魁尔斯礼服，一件轻薄透明的紫罗兰锦绣，剪短以露出左侧乳房。她的银金色的头发随意地披散在肩上，垂下的发端几乎触到乳头。大厅中有半数的人偷偷地瞥视她，但是除了札罗。过去在魁尔斯就是如此。她无法用这种方式诱惑商人巨子。无论如何，我一定要诱惑到他。他乘坐“绸云”号从魁尔斯来到这里，带着十三艘战船而来，他的舰队等待一个答复。自从她禁止了奴隶交易，弥林的贸易就逐渐减少直至完全没有，但是札罗有能力让它恢复如初。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was harder to know what her honored guest was dreaming. The pale, lean, hawk-faced man who shared her high table was resplendent in robes of maroon silk and cloth-of-gold, his bald head shining in the torchlight as he devoured a fig with small, precise, elegant bites. Opals winked along the nose of Xaro Xhoan Daxos as his head turned to follow the dancers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今更难知道她尊贵的客人在想些什么。跟她同坐在高桌边的苍白瘦削的鹰脸男人，穿着华丽的褐紫色丝绸长袍，衣服上缀满了黄金。当他小口的吞下一枚无花果优雅地咬碎时，秃顶的脑袋闪闪发光；当他的头转向舞者少女时，札罗？赞旺？达梭斯鼻子上的猫眼石灼灼闪耀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Daenerys held out her cup for Irri to refill. The wine was sweet and strong, redolent with the smell of eastern spices, much superior to the thin Ghiscari wines that had filled her cup of late. Xaro perused the fruits on the platter Jhiqui offered him and chose a persimmon. Its orange skin matched the color of the coral in his nose. He took a bite and pursed his lips. "Tart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮莉丝举起杯子让伊丽倒满，酒又甜又烈，散发出浓烈的东方香料的味道，比上一杯清淡的吉斯卡利酒名贵的多。札罗扫了一眼姬琪端给他的一盘水果，挑了一个柿子。橘黄色的柿子皮和他鼻子上珊瑚的颜色很相配。他咬了一口，然后皱起嘴唇，“酸的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her face was warm. The wine, she told herself. Yet somehow she found herself thinking of Daario Naharis. His messenger had come that morning. The Stormcrows were returning from Lhazar. Her captain was riding back to her, bringing her the friendship of the Lamb Men. Food and trade, she reminded herself. He did not fail me, nor will he. Daario will help me save my city. The queen longed to see his face, to stroke his three-pronged beard, to tell him her troubles… but the Stormcrows were still many days away, beyond the Khyzai Pass, and she had a realm to rule.</div>

<div class="line_en">Smoke hung between the purple pillars. The dancers knelt, heads bowed. "You were splendid," Dany told them. "Seldom have I seen such grace, such beauty." She beckoned to Reznak mo Reznak, and the seneschal scurried to her side. Beads of sweat dotted his bald, wrinkled head. "Escort our guests to the baths, that they may refresh themselves, and bring them food and drink."</div>

<div class="line_en">For centuries Meereen and her sister cities Yunkai and Astapor had been the linchpins of the slave trade, the place where Dothraki khals and the corsairs of the Basilisk Isles sold their captives and the rest of the world came to buy. Without slaves, Meereen had little to offer traders. Copper was plentiful in the Ghiscari hills, but the metal was not as valuable as it had been when bronze ruled the world. The cedars that had once grown tall along the coast grew no more, felled by the axes of the Old Empire or consumed by dragonfire when Ghis made war against Valyria. Once the trees had gone, the soil baked beneath the hot sun and blew away in thick red clouds. "It was these calamities that transformed my people into slavers," Galazza Galare had told her, at the Temple of the Graces. And I am the calamity that will change these slavers back into people, Dany had sworn to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个世纪以来，弥林和她的姐妹城市：渊凯、阿斯塔波就是奴隶交易的枢纽，是多斯拉克的卡奥们和蛇蜥群岛的海盗们出售战俘以及世界的其他各地购买战俘之地。没有奴隶，弥林没有其他东西提供给商人们。吉斯卡利山上有丰富的铜矿，然而自从青铜风靡世界之后，铜便不再像以前那样有价值。沿着海岸，曾经长满了高大的雪松，而今不再生长。当吉斯向瓦雷利亚开战，雪松或被古老帝国的斧头砍倒或被龙息烧为灰烬。自从树木消失不见，土壤先是被火热的太阳烘烤，后又被卷起滚滚红云的大风吹走殆尽。“就是这些灾难把我的平民变为奴隶贩子，”伽拉撒？伽拉瑞曾经在荣誉之塔上这么告诉她。而我就是把这些奴隶贩子变回平民的灾难，丹妮曾对自己发誓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sweetness cloys. Tart fruit and tart women give life its savor." Xaro took another bite, chewed, swallowed. "Daenerys, sweet queen, I cannot tell you what pleasure it gives me to bask once more in your presence. A child departed Qarth, as lost as she was lovely. I feared she was sailing to her doom, yet now I find her here enthroned, mistress of an ancient city, surrounded by a mighty host that she raised up out of dreams."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“甜的，倒胃口。酸水果和酸女人让生活更有味道。”札罗又咬了一口，嚼了嚼咽下，“丹妮莉丝，甜后，我都无法向你表达再一次见到你的出席给了我多大的愉悦。一个孩子从魁尔斯离开，她是那么的可爱。我害怕她正航向死亡，然而现在，我发现她在这里登上王位，成为一个古老城市的女主人，被她从梦中兴起的强有力的军队所环绕。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Sons of the Harpy." How does he know that? "They scrawl on walls by night and cut the throats of honest freedmen as they sleep. When the sun comes up they hide like roaches. They fear my Brazen Beasts." Skahaz mo Kandaq had given her the new watch she had asked for, made up in equal numbers of freedmen and shavepate Meereenese. They walked the streets both day and night, in dark hoods and brazen masks. The Sons of the Harpy had promised grisly death to any traitor who dared serve the dragon queen, and to their kith and kin as well, so the Shavepate's men went about as jackals, owls, and other beasts, keeping their true faces hidden. "I might have cause to fear the Sons if they saw me wandering alone through the streets, but only if it was night and I was naked and unarmed. They are craven creatures."</div>

<div class="line_en">Groleo was aghast. "We must accept these ships. If we refuse this gift…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Barristan went to one knee before her. "My queen, your realm has need of you. You are not wanted here, but in Westeros men will flock to your banners by the thousands, great lords and noble knights. 'She is come,' they will shout to one another, in glad voices. 'Prince Rhaegar's sister has come home at last.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴利斯坦爵士单膝跪在她面前，“我的女王，你的王国需要你。这里不欢迎你，但是在维斯特洛，数千的民众等着聚集到你的旗下，包括大领主和高贵骑士。‘她回来了，’他们会用欢喜的声音一传十、十传百，‘雷加王子的妹妹终于回家了。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Enough." Dany slapped the table. "No one will be left to die. You are all my people." Her dreams of home and love had blinded her. "I will not abandon Meereen to the fate of Astapor. It grieves me to say so, but Westeros must wait."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“够了。”丹妮用力拍打桌面，“没有人会留下来送死。你们都是我的子民。”回家与爱情的梦想让她盲目。“我不会抛弃弥林，让它走上阿斯塔波的毁灭之路。这么说让我悲痛，但是维斯特洛必须等。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If they love me so much, they will wait for me." Dany stood. "Reznak, summon Xaro Xhoan Daxos."</div>

<div class="line_en">She received the merchant prince alone, seated on her bench of polished ebony, on the cushions Ser Barristan had brought her. Four Qartheen sailors accompanied him, bearing a rolled tapestry upon their shoulders. "I have brought another gift for the queen of my heart," Xaro announced. "It has been in my family vaults since before the Doom that took Valyria."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她单独接见了商人巨子，坐在磨光的乌木长椅上，垫了巴利斯坦爵士找给她的坐垫。四个魁尔斯水手跟随他而来，卷成一卷儿的绣帷分跨在他们肩上。“我给我心爱的女王带来另一份礼物，”札罗宣称，“自从古瓦雷利亚毁灭之日，就一直保存在我们家族的宝库里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There you see Astapor, and Yunkai, and Meereen." Xaro pointed at three silver stars beside the blue of Slaver's Bay. "Westeros is… somewhere down there." His hand waved vaguely toward the far end of the hall. "You turned north when you should have continued south and west, across the Summer Sea, but with my gift you shall soon be back where you belong. Accept my galleys with a joyful heart, and bend your oars westward."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那里你可以看到阿斯塔波、渊凯和弥林。”札罗指着蓝色的奴隶湾边上的三个银星说，“维斯特洛在…那边下方的某处。”他抬手大致地指向厅角，“你需要先向南向西航行，然后转向北穿越夏日之海，不过有了我的礼物，用不了多久你就会回到属于你的那个地方。用快乐的心情接受我的舰队吧，然后划动你的船桨向西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sailors unrolled the tapestry across the floor. It was old, dusty, faded… and huge. Dany had to move to Xaro's side before the patterns became plain. "A map? It is beautiful." It covered half the floor. The seas were blue, the lands were green, the mountains black and brown. Cities were shown as stars in gold or silver thread. There is no Smoking Sea, she realized. Valyria is not yet an island.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水手们在地板上展开绣帷。古老，尘污，褪色…还有巨大。丹妮必须绕到札罗那边才能看清图案的全貌。“一张地图？太美了。”它铺满了半个地板，大海是蓝色，陆地是绿色，山脉是黑色或棕色，城镇标记成用金线或银线绣成的星。上面没有烟海，她注意到，瓦雷利亚还不是一个岛屿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Would that I could. "My lord, I will gladly have those ships, but I cannot give you the promise that you ask." She took his hand. "Give me the galleys, and I swear that Qarth will have the friendship of Meereen until the stars go out. Let me trade with them, and you will have a good part of the profits."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但愿我能。“我的大人，我非常高兴能拥有这些战船，但是我不能给你想要的保证。她拉过他的手，“给我舰队，我发誓魁尔斯会保有弥林的友谊直到天上的群星熄灭。让我们用这些船从事贸易，你会得到其中的大部分利润。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tears welled from his eyes, creeping down his nose, past emeralds, amethysts, and black diamonds. "I told the Thirteen that you would heed my wisdom. It grieves me to learn that I was wrong. Take these ships and sail away, or you will surely die screaming. You cannot know how many enemies you have made."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼泪从他的双眼涌出，从他的鼻子滑下，滑过祖母绿、紫水晶、黑钻石。“我告诉十三巨子，你会听从我的明智建议。知道自己错了真的让我伤心。登上这些船扬帆起航吧，否则你必定会尖叫着死去。你不知道你招来了多少敌人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When I went to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones to beg the Pureborn for your life, I said that you were no more than a child," Xaro went on, "but Egon Emeros the Exquisite rose and said, 'She is a foolish child, mad and heedless and too dangerous to live.' When your dragons were small they were a wonder. Grown, they are death and devastation, a flaming sword above the world." He wiped away the tears. "I should have slain you in Qarth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我去‘千座之殿’乞求王族们放你一条生路，我说你只是个孩子。”札罗继续，“但是‘优雅的’艾耿？艾摩若站起来说，‘她是个愚蠢的孩子，疯狂、不听劝告、让她活着太危险。’你的龙小的时候是奇迹；长大了，他们就是死亡和毁灭，悬在这个世界之上的一把火焰之剑。”他擦去眼泪，“我应该在魁尔斯就杀死你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
