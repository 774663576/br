<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. It'd be nice to find a quiet one, but there aren't any in this neighborhood."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。找间安静的餐厅好了，但这附近没有安静的餐厅。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, certainly." It was twelve fifteen already. Therese knew she would be terribly late, and it didn't matter at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not bother to talk on the way. Now and then the crowds made them separate, and once the woman glanced at Therese, across a pushcart full of dresses, smiling. They went into a restaurant with wooden rafters and white tablecloths, that miraculously was quiet, and not half filled. They sat down in a large wooden booth, and the woman ordered an old-fashioned without sugar, and invited Therese to have one, or a sherry, and when Therese hesitated, sent the waiter away with the order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往餐厅去的路上，她们并没有交谈。有时人潮会冲散她们，有一次那女人隔着一辆装满衣服的推车看着特芮丝，笑盈盈的。她们走进一家有木头椽子屋顶和白色桌面的餐厅，餐厅异常安静，客人还没坐满一半。她们在一个木制卡座就座，那女人点了杯传统鸡尾酒，问特芮丝要不要喝一杯，或点杯雪莉酒。特芮丝还在迟疑时，她已经点好菜让服务生去处理了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I remembered you," Therese said. She looked at the small pearl earrings, that were somehow no lighter than her hair itself, or her eyes. Therese thought her beautiful, though her face was a blur now because she could not bear to look at it directly. She got something out of her handbag, a lipstick and compact, and Therese looked at her lipstick case -- golden like a jewel, and shaped like a sea chest. She wanted to look at the woman's mouth, but the gray eyes so close drove her away, flickering over her like fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我记得你。”特芮丝说。她看着那串小小的珍珠耳环，那串耳环不知为何不像她的头发或眼睛那么明亮。特芮丝觉得她很美，觉得她的脸变得模糊起来，因为她现在无法直视她。那女人从包里拿出口红和粉盒，特芮丝看着她的口红盒，金色如珠宝，形状像水手的储物箱。特芮丝还想看看那女人的嘴，但那双灰色的眼睛就在特芮丝眼前，让她无法直视她的嘴，目光像火苗一样在她身上跳跃闪烁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took off her hat and ran her fingers through her blond hair, once on either side, and looked at Therese. "And where did you get the nice idea of sending me a Christmas card?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她脱下帽子，用手指梳理她的金发，两边各一次，然后看着特芮丝。“你怎么会有这么好的点子，要寄圣诞卡片给我？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Only about two weeks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，大概只有两个礼拜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You haven't been working there very long, have you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你才刚去那家店上班没有很久吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you won't be much longer -- probably." She offered Therese a cigarette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也不会待太久，是这样没错吧？”她递给特芮丝一根烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese took one. "No. I'll have another job." She leaned toward the lighter the woman was holding for her, toward the slim hand with the oval red nails and a sprinkling of freckles on its back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝接过了烟。“不会，我找到另一份工作了。”她往前靠，迎向那女人替她拿着的打火机，迎向那双纤纤玉手。那双手留着椭圆形的红指甲，手背上有一点点雀斑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“圣诞卡片？”她自己笑了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course not," Therese said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然没有。”特芮丝说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“常送人明信片吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, here's to Christmas." She touched Therese's glass and drank. "Where do you live? In Manhattan?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我们敬圣诞节。”她碰了特芮丝的玻璃杯一下，把酒一饮而尽。“你住哪里？曼哈顿？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Post cards?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“明信片？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And what do you do in your spare time?" The lamp on the table made her eyes silvery, full of liquid light. Even the pearl at her earlobe looked alive, like a drop of water that a touch might destroy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你空闲时做什么？”桌上的灯让她的眼睛带上了一点银色，充满如水一般的光亮，即使是她耳垂上的珍珠都显得栩栩如生，就像一滴轻轻一碰便会破碎的水珠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese told her. On Sixty-third Street. Her parents were dead, she said. She had lived in New York the past two years, and before that at a school in New Jersey. Therese did not tell her that the school was semi-religious, Episcopalian. She did not mention Sister Alicia whom she adored and thought of so often, with her pale-blue eyes and her ugly nose and her loving sternness. Because since yesterday morning, Sister Alicia had been thrust far away, far below the woman who sat opposite her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝告诉她说自己住在第六十三街上。她还说她父母双亡，这两年来都住在纽约，之前则是在新泽西的学校。特芮丝没有告诉她的是，那是一所宗教气息浓厚的学校，是圣公会的学校。她没有提到她崇拜的艾莉西亚修女，没有说她常常想起她蓝色的眼睛、丑陋的鼻子和慈严兼备的个性。因为从昨天早上开始，她就已经把艾莉西亚修女抛得老远了，修女远远比不上坐在对面的这个女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I --" Should she tell her she usually worked on her stage models? Sketched and painted sometimes, carved things like cats' heads and tiny figures to go in her ballet sets, but that she liked best to take long walks practically anywhere, liked best simply to dream? Therese felt she did not have to tell her. She felt the woman's eyes could not look at anything without understanding completely. Therese took some more of her drink, liking it, though it was like the woman to swallow, she thought, terrifying, and strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我……”她应该告诉她自己常做舞台模型吗？该告诉她自己会素描和画画，或雕刻一些小东西，像猫的头和小人，好放入她的芭蕾舞场景中？其实她最喜欢的是到外面好好走一段路散步，最喜欢做梦。特芮丝觉得不必告诉她这些事。她认为那女人的眼睛必定能透彻了解她所看到的每样东西。特芮丝又喝了点酒，她很喜欢这种酒，很像那种会吞灭人的女性，特芮丝想，既强烈又可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman nodded to the waiter, and two more drinks arrived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女人点头向服务生示意，然后又有两杯酒送到了她们桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" Therese asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喜欢什么？”特芮丝问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She might have been speaking of a doll, Therese thought, so casually had she told her she was pretty. "I think you are magnificent," Therese said with the courage of the second drink, not caring how it might sound, because she knew the woman knew anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝想，她好像在说娃娃一样，她用这么自然的方式来称赞特芮丝。“我认为你很棒。”借着第二杯酒带来的勇气，特芮丝这样说。她不在乎她的语气听起来如何，因为她知道那女人自己也知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm glad." Therese smiled, wondering if she were serious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很高兴。”特芮丝笑了笑，一面猜想她是不是在说真话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're a very pretty girl," she said. "And very sensitive, too, aren't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你很漂亮，”她说，“而且也非常敏感，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I like it that someone sent me a card, someone I didn't know. It's the way things should be at Christmas. And this year I like it especially."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我喜欢有人送我卡片，不认识的人。就像圣诞节一样。今年我特别希望这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She laughed, putting her head back. It was a sound more beautiful than music. It made a little wrinkle at the corner of her eyes, and it made her purse her red lips as she drew on her cigarette. She gazed past Therese for a moment, her elbows on the table and her chin propped up on the hand that held her cigarette. There was a long line, from the waist of her fitted black suit up to the widening shoulder, and then the blond head with the fine, unruly hair held high. She was about thirty or thirty-two, Therese thought, and her daughter, for whom she had bought the valise and the doll, would be perhaps six or eight. Therese could imagine the child, blond haired, the face golden and happy, the body slim and well proportioned, and always playing. But the child's face, unlike the woman's with its short cheeks and rather Nordic compactness, was vague and nondescript. And the husband? Therese could not see him at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她笑了起来，头往后仰，声音比音乐更美妙。她的笑容让眼角泛起一点小皱纹，她点香烟时，红色的双唇噘了起来。她看着特芮丝，她的手肘抵在餐桌上，下巴则撑在拿香烟的那只手上。她合身的黑色套装腰身附近一直到拉宽的肩膀处有一条长长的线，而她的头上则顶着一头细致又未加梳理的金发。特芮丝想，她大约三十或三十二岁，买了个行李箱和娃娃送给女儿，她女儿大概六岁或八岁。特芮丝可以想像那个小女孩留着金发，金黄色的脸孔洋溢着欢乐，纤细的身躯比例匀称，而且一直在玩耍。但小女孩的脸庞，又和这个女人双颊窄小、像北欧人般的小巧脸孔不同，小孩脸上的五官比较平板单调。那丈夫呢？特芮丝完全没办法想像他的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese said, "I'm sure you thought it was a man who sent you the Christmas card, didn't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝说：“我猜想，你本来以为寄圣诞卡片的是个男的，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I did," she said through a smile. "I thought it just might be a man in the ski department who'd sent it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”她微笑着说，“我以为可能是那个滑雪部的男人寄的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真抱歉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I'm delighted." She leaned back in the booth. "I doubt very, much if I'd have gone to lunch with him. No, I'm delighted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用抱歉。我很高兴。”她靠回到卡座中。“我大概不会邀他一起吃午餐。不用抱歉，我很高兴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dusky and faintly sweet smell of her perfume came to Therese again, a smell suggestive of dark-green silk, that was hers alone, like the smell of a special flower. Therese leaned closer toward it, looking down at her glass. She wanted to thrust the table aside and spring into her arms, to bury her nose in the green and gold scarf that was tied close about her neck. Once the backs of their hands brushed on the table, and Therese's skin there felt separately alive now, and rather burning. Therese could not understand it, but it was so. Therese glanced at her face that was somewhat turned away, and again she knew that instant of half-recognition. And knew, too, that it was not to be believed. She had never seen the woman before. If she had, could she have forgotten? In the silence, Therese felt they both waited for the other to speak, yet the silence was not an awkward one. Their plates had arrived. It was creamed spinach with an egg on top, steamy and buttery smelling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝又闻到她淡雅的香水味，有墨绿色丝绸的感觉，只属于她，就像某种奇花异卉的香味一般。特芮丝倾身靠香味更近一点，往下看着她的杯子。她想要把桌子用力推开，投入她的怀中，把鼻子紧紧埋入她颈上那条金绿色相间的围巾。她们的手背偶尔在桌上轻触，特芮丝的肌肤就马上变成独立的个体，有了自己的生命，而且一直发热。特芮丝不明白自己为什么会这样，但事情就是这样。特芮丝瞥见她稍稍转向一旁的脸孔，刹那间再度明白了似曾相识的感觉是什么。她也知道这简直难以置信，因为自己从没见过这个女人。如果见过的话，又怎么可能会忘记呢？在沉默中，特芮丝觉得彼此都在等待对方开口，但这种沉默也不会让人感觉不自在。她们点的餐来了，奶油菠菜，上面加了个蛋，冒着热气和奶香味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But not in tedious detail. In six sentences, as if it all mattered less to her than a story she had read somewhere. And what did the facts matter after all, whether her mother was French or English or Hungarian, or if her father had been an Irish painter, or a Czechoslovakian lawyer, whether he had been successful or not, or whether her mother had presented her to the Order of St. Margaret as a troublesome, bawling infant, or as a troublesome, melancholy eight-year-old? Or whether she had been happy there? Because she was happy now, starting today. She had no need of parents or background.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但特芮丝没有告诉她其他的细节。她只用了六句话，仿佛她的故事的重要性还比不上在其他地方读到的故事。但那些事实究竟有何重要性？她母亲是法国人、英国人或匈牙利人？她父亲是爱尔兰画家或捷克律师？他有没有出人头地？她母亲把她送到天主教圣玛加利会的时候，她是烦人的、大声哭闹的婴儿，还是烦人的、忧郁的八岁女孩？她在那里是否快乐？她现在很快乐，从今天开始一定会很快乐，所以她没有必要提到父母或她的背景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese did not ponder it. It was right. She was still smiling, as if she had just learned how to smile and did not know how to stop. The woman smiled with her, amusedly, and perhaps she was laughing at her, Therese thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝并没有仔细思考这句话。没错。她仍然在微笑着，仿佛她才刚学会怎么笑，不知道怎样才能停下来。那女人和她一起笑，表情很愉快，或许她在嘲笑她。特芮丝这样想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. The way you do," she answered. Carol pronounced her name the French way, Terez. She was used to a dozen variations, and sometimes she herself pronounced it differently. She liked the way Carol pronounced it, and she liked her lips saying it. An indefinite longing, that she had been only vaguely conscious of at times before, became now a recognizable wish. It was so absurd, so embarrassing a desire, that Therese thrust it from her mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，就像你念的那样。”她这样回答。卡罗尔用法文的发音念出特芮丝的名字。特芮丝已经习惯自己的名字有好几种不同的念法，有时候她也会用不同的方式念她的名字。她很喜欢卡罗尔念她名字的方式，她也喜欢她的双唇吐出她的名字。那是一种无止境的渴望，她以前只是偶尔、隐约意识到这种渴望，现在这种渴望成了真实的愿望。这欲望实在太过奇怪、太令人困窘，特芮丝把这种欲望从脑海中甩开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“最近没做什么。如果你想要找我，随时欢迎。我住的地方景观不错，乡村景观。这礼拜天想不想过来走走？”那双灰色的眼睛现在直直地看着她，这是特芮丝第一次面对那双眼睛。特芮丝看到其中透露出一丝风趣。还透露出其他什么呢？好奇心，还有挑战。">查看中文翻译</div>
