<div class="line_en">Assuming the role of Death is a terrifying thing. Tomas insisted that he would not give the injection himself; he would have the vet come and do it. But then he realized that he could grant Karenin a privilege forbidden to humans: Death would come for him in the guise of his loved ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲自担任死神的角色，是何等残酷！在相当长的一段时间内，托马斯都坚决说他决不会亲手给卡列宁打针，说他会叫兽医来的。可是他最终明白了：他可以让卡列宁享受任何人都得不到的一种特权，即在所爱之人的注目下让死神悄悄降临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dogs do not have many advantages over people, but one of them is extremely important: euthanasia is not forbidden by law in their case; animals have the right to a merciful death. Karenin walked on three legs and spent more and more of his time lying in a corner. And whimpering. Both husband and wife agreed that they had no business letting him suffer needlessly. But agree as they might in principle, they still had to face the anguish of determining the time when his suffering was in fact needless, the point at which life was no longer worth living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与人相比，狗几乎没有什么特权，但它倒是有一项值得重视：它不受法律的制约，可以享受安乐死。动物有权无痛苦地死亡。卡列宁现在只能用三只脚走路，呆在一个角落里的时间也越来越长。它呻吟着。特蕾莎和托马斯意见一致：他们没有权利让卡列宁无谓地受罪。可是，在这个原则上达成的一致意见并没有使他们摆脱烦恼，因为实在说不准：怎么知道它的痛苦什么时候是无谓的？怎么确定什么时候开始没有必要再活下去？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a few minutes they would both have to go to work. Tereza went in to see Karenin. Until then, he had lain in his corner completely apathetic (not even acknowledging Tomas when he felt his leg), but when he heard the door open and saw Tereza come in, he raised his head and looked at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俩马上就要上工了。特蕾莎去屋里找卡列宁。在这之前，它一直漠然地躺着（甚至几分钟前托马斯给它作检查时，它都没有注意到什么），可这时，当它听见开门的声音，马上抬起头，看着特蕾莎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Karenin had whimpered all night. After feeling his leg in the morning, Tomas said to Tereza, There's no point in waiting.</div>

<div class="line_en">She could not stand his stare; it almost frightened her. He did not look that way at Tomas, only at her. But never with such intensity. It was not a desperate look, or even sad. No, it was a look of awful, unbearable trust. The look was an eager question. All his life Karenin had waited for answers from Tereza, and he was letting her know (with more urgency than usual, however) that he was still ready to learn the truth from her. (Everything that came from Tereza was the truth. Even when she gave commands like Sit! or Lie down! he took them as truths to identify with, to give his life meaning.) His look of awful trust did not last long; he soon laid his head back down on his paws. Tereza knew that no one ever again would look at her like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎无法承受这目光，她感到恐惧。它从未以这种眼神看过托马斯，只对特蕾莎这样，但眼光从未像今天这么急切。那不是绝望或忧伤的眼光。眼中流露出让人不能承受的、令人心悸的信任感。这是一种渴望问个明白的眼神。卡列宁用了整整一生等待特蕾莎的回答，此刻，它（比以往还更为急切）要特蕾莎明白，它一直都在等着她把真相告诉它（因为对它来说，所有来自于特蕾莎的都是真理，比如特蕾莎叫它“坐下”或“躺倒”，这些都是真理，卡列宁与之结为一体，并赋予其生活以某种意义）。这一令人心悸的信任眼光是短暂的，很快，卡列宁就把头靠在脚上，特蕾莎知道再也不会有人像这样看她了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had never fed him sweets, but recently she had bought him a few chocolate bars. She took them out of the foil, broke them into pieces, and made a circle of them around him. Then she brought over a bowl of water to make sure that he had everything he needed for the several hours he would spend at home alone. The look he had given her just then seemed to have tired him out. Even surrounded by chocolate, he did not raise his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从不给卡列宁甜食吃，不过几天前，特蕾莎买了几板巧克力。她剥开锡纸，把巧克力掰成碎块，放在卡列宁嘴边。她还放了一碗水，这样，它独自在家的时候就什么都不缺了。可是，它刚刚投向特蕾莎的那种目光，似乎把自己累着了。尽管嘴边都是巧克力块，它仍未抬头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she had to go and take care of her heifers. She did not return until just before lunch. Tomas had not come home yet. Karenin was still lying on the floor surrounded by the chocolate, and did not even lift his head when he heard her come in. His bad leg was swollen now, and the tumor had burst in another place. She noticed some light red (not blood-like,) drops forming beneath his fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，特蕾莎必须出去放牛了，午饭后才回到家。托马斯还没回来，卡列宁始终躺着，身边是一块块巧克力。听见特蕾莎走过来，它头也没抬一下。那条病腿肿肿的，肿瘤扩散到了另一个部位。腿毛上有淡淡的一滴红（不像是血）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She lay down on the floor next to him and hugged him. With a slow and labored turn of the head, he sniffed her and gave her a lick or two. She closed her eyes while the licking went on, as if she wanted to remember it forever. She held out the other cheek to be licked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎跪倒在它身旁，将它抱起。卡列宁动作缓慢地嗅了嗅她，吃力地舔了她一两下。她闭着眼眸接受卡列宁的这份爱抚，仿佛要把这永远印在记忆里。她转过头，想让卡列宁再舔她的另一边脸颊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly she spread a sheet out over the couch. It was a white sheet with a pattern of tiny violets. She had everything carefully laid out and thought out, having imagined Karenin's death many days in advance. (Oh, how horrible that we actually dream ahead to the death of those we love!) He no longer had the strength to jump up on the couch. They picked him up in their arms together. Tereza laid him on his side, and Tomas examined one of his good legs. He was looking for a more or less prominent vein. Then he cut away the fur with a pair of scissors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢地，她将一块床单铺在床上。这是条白床单，上面缀有小紫花图案。她早已准备好了一切，想到了一切，仿佛早在几天前，就想到了卡列宁的后事。（啊！多可怕！我们竟然提前想到我们所爱之人的后事！）卡列宁也没有力气跳上床。托马斯和特蕾莎抱起它，将它抬了起来。特蕾莎让它侧躺在床边，托马斯检查它的腿。他找到了血管凸起、暴露在外的那一部位，用剪刀剪净了上面的毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again she lay down next to him on the floor. She stretched one arm across his body and closed her eyes. Then she heard someone banging on the door. Doctor! Doctor! The pig is here! The pig and his master! She lacked the strength to talk to anyone, and did not move, did not open her eyes. Doctor! Doctor! The pigs have come! Then silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟早晨一样，特蕾莎又跪倒在卡列宁身边。她用一只胳膊挽着它，闭上眼睛。不一会儿，她听见了咚咚的敲门声。“大夫，大夫！是梅菲斯突和合作社主席来了！”特蕾莎不能跟任何人说话。她眼睛闭着，一动不动。她又听见了一声喊叫：“大夫，猪来看您了。”然后是一阵沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas did not get back for another half hour. He went straight to the kitchen and prepared the injection without a word. When he entered the room, Tereza was on her feet and Karenin was picking himself up. As soon as he saw Tomas, he gave him a weak wag of the tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了半个钟头，托马斯回来了。他一声不吭，径直朝厨房走去，准备针剂。他回到房间时，特蕾莎正站着，卡列宁动了动，想站起来。看见托马斯，它有气无力地摇了摇尾巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Look, said Tereza, he's still smiling. She said it beseechingly, trying to win a short reprieve, but did not push for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">They came back towards evening. Tomas went into the garden. He found the lines of the rectangle that Tereza had drawn with her heel between the two apple trees.
