<div class="line_en">"Yeah." He sighed, looking out across the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊。”他轻叹一声，凝望着湖水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We row," he said simply. He reached under Dylan's bench, causing her to yank her legs quickly to the side, and retrieved two battered-looking oars. Dylan was positive this time -- they had not been there when she'd clambered into the boat. He stuck an oar into each of the rowlocks on the side of the boat -- where the hell had they come from? -- and lowered them towards the dark waves. They sliced through and Tristan began to row slowly, using one oar at first until he'd turned the boat round, and then powerfully with both arms. He had removed his jumper before he'd climbed into the boat and the T-shirt he wore revealed his impressive physique. He handled the dinghy confidently, hands clenched in fists around the handles, their grip firm and strong. With effortless strokes, he pulled them through the water.</div>

<div class="line_en">He snorted. "No, I would like to get there before the end of time, if you don't mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不屑地说：“不用了，你要是不介意的话，我可以在时限结束前就划到目的地。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan stared at the way his muscles bunched and strained as he rowed, the movement pulling the thin cotton of his T-shirt tight against his chest. She felt her cheeks grow hot, and a strange urge to fidget made it hard to sit still. She swallowed, then glanced up to see him watching her. Mortified to be caught ogling, she dropped her gaze to the oars, slicing through the rippling surface of the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦看着他身上的肌肉随着划桨的动作不时地聚拢绷紧，那件薄薄的T恤紧紧贴着他的胸口，感到自己的脸颊慢慢变红了，一种异样的躁动让她坐不安稳。她干咽了一下，然后无意中发现他正在看着自己。被人看到眼神、猜破心事让迪伦大窘，她把目光移到桨上，看着它们在湖面荡起层层涟漪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Watching the smooth, circular motion of the paddle, Dylan had a horrible thought. "You're not expecting me to take a turn, are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦看着他熟练地、周而复始地划着桨，心里突然迸出了一个可怕的念头，“你不会是打算让我跟你轮换着划吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan raised her eyebrows, but as she was getting what she wanted, she didn't argue further. Instead she stared out across the water. The hill they had just descended appeared to be the centre of a horseshoe of peaks that circled half of the lake. They curled inwards providing a measure of protection from the weather. Maybe that was why the water was so calm, the swell barely rocking the tiny boat. The landscape in the direction they were heading, however, was empty. It was as if the world just fell away. It was quite disconcerting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦扬了扬眉毛，但既然已经得到了想要的答案，她也不愿多做口舌之争。她的目光掠过水面四下张望，周围群峰耸立，好似一块马蹄铁环绕着半个湖区，他们刚刚走下的那座山恰好位于马蹄铁的中心。山峰向内弯曲，保护着湖水免受外面天气的影响。大概这就是湖面异常平静，舟行水上几乎没有什么晃动的原因吧。而小船驶往的目的地却景色空旷，世界似乎在那里消失了一般。真让人心神不定啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although Tristan was rowing fairly slowly, his powerful strokes were moving them quickly across the lake and Dylan could barely see the shore that they'd pushed off from. The opposite side was still not in sight either, and she experienced a momentary feeling of fear. What if the battered little boat started taking on water? Dylan wasn't sure she would be able to make it to shore; she wasn't a confident swimmer at all. Her mother had forced her to take lessons as a small child, but as soon as she was old enough to be aware of the fact that she had a body, she had refused point blank to keep going. It wasn't that she was embarrassed about her poor ability, but the fifteen-metre walk from the changing room -- unisex, no less -- to the pool, three-quarters naked, was humiliating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管崔斯坦划得很慢，但是动作却非常有力，桨片在水面上下翻飞，迪伦几乎已经看不清刚才离开的水岸了。而对岸也遥不可及，一时间迪伦感到一阵恐慌。如果这条破船开始漏水该怎么办呢？迪伦不确定自己能不能平安到达对岸，她对自己的游泳技术一点信心都没有。很小的时候，她的母亲曾经逼着她上游泳课，但当她稍大一点、有了对身体的自主意识后，就坚决不去了。她倒不是对自己糟糕的游泳技术感到难为情，主要是因为从更衣室（居然是男女通用的）到泳池，要裸露着四分之三的身体走十五米，这也太丢人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was also the thought of having to dive into that water. Here in the centre, it was just as black and Dylan could see nothing below the surface. There was no way to tell how deep it was or what might lurk beneath. Hanging her arm over the side, she let her fingertips trail through the water. Within seconds, her fingers felt pained from the freezing chill of the water. The air temperature was lovely; the water shouldn't have been so cold. It was unnatural. It also felt, oddly, slightly thicker than water. Not quite the consistency of oil, but somewhere in between. Yes, a sinking boat would definitely be a bad thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦想到了必要时可能还得跳入水中。船到湖心，湖水又那么黑，她看不清下面到底有什么。没办法分辨湖水有多深，也不知道里面潜藏着些什么东西。她把胳膊垂在船舷上，用手指划过水面。霎时就感到了湖水刺骨的冰冷，这太不正常了。而且水摸起来怪怪的，比一般的水要黏稠，密度大概介于石油和水之间。没错，这个时候要是船往下沉那绝对是糟透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wouldn't do that if I were you," Tristan commented, pulling her out of her thoughts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要是你就不会那么做。”崔斯坦这句话把迪伦从胡思乱想中拉了回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan gulped and put both hands firmly in her lap, but she couldn't help leaning slightly over the side and peering into the waves. It was pointless, though; she could see nothing. Still, she continued to gaze, slightly mesmerised by the undulation of the water. The only sound was the gentle splash of the oars rhythmically breaking the surface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦倒吸了一口冷气，把双手紧紧贴在腿上。不过，她还是忍不住将身子微微探过船舷，偷偷瞄着湖面的浪花，尽管这样一点用也没有。虽然什么也看不见，她还是继续凝视着起伏的水浪，意识稍稍有些恍惚。此时只能听到桨叶有节奏地划过湖面时轻柔的水花飞溅的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“做什么？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded towards the hand that still rippled the surface of the lake. "That."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他朝着迪伦那只还在划水的手点头示意，“这么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么不行？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave her a steady look. "Better safe than sorry," he finally said. "You never know what's hiding under there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他注视着她，目光沉稳，最后说：“小心无大错，你永远也不会知道这水下藏着什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instantly, Dylan yanked her hand away and examined it closely, as if she expected it to have turned black like the water, or a fingertip to be missing. Of course it was fine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦猛然把手抽回来，仔细检查了一番，生怕这手也会变得跟湖水一样黑，或是指尖消失掉。自然，一切安然无恙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan watched her watching the waves. Her eyes were wide, catching the light sparkling on the surface, but really seeing nothing. Her face looked peaceful, forehead unlined with a slight smile playing softly across her lips. Her hands were now jammed between her knees, and the pose made him grin to himself, although the grin quickly faded. She was right to listen to him; there were things lurking here that belonged in her nightmares. Creatures of the deep more at home in a science fiction or fantasy novel. Still, her mood was calm, and so the weather matched accordingly. At this pace they would be safely across and out of danger long before dark. To the safe house. He couldn't bring himself to think any further ahead than that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她看向水面的时候，崔斯坦也在注视着她。只见她的眼睛睁得很大，望着水面粼粼的波光失神。她的面相平和文静，额头光滑无痕，嘴角挂着浅笑。她的双手夹在两膝之间，这样的坐姿让他暗自好笑，不过笑意很快就消散了。她听他的话是没错的，水下正潜伏着她梦魇中出现的东西—在科幻小说中行动自如的深水怪物。不过，此时的她却心静如水，所以天气也是风和日丽。照这个速度划，他们能在天黑前早早地远离危险，平安上岸，到达安全屋。他不敢想得更远了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomorrow. So soon. One more night, then he would have to let her go and never see her again. His throat constricted at the thought. Ordinarily, this lake crossing was the best part of the journey. Ordinarily, he longed to be free of whatever soul burdened him, desperate to get away from the whining, complaining and self-pity. Not this time. It would be agony to watch her go where she deserved, but where he could never follow. He watched Dylan's eyes widen as she took in his words. They seemed to shimmer slightly and he wondered for one brief, euphoric but painful moment, whether they held tears. He looked away, concentrating on where he was going. He couldn't stand to see her face any more. His fingers trembled slightly, and he tightened his grip on the oars as he pulled them closer to goodbye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明天，这么快。再过一晚上，他就会让她一个人走，然后再也看不到她了。他的喉头一紧。通常来说，穿越湖区的行程是整个长途跋涉中最舒服的一段路。通常说来，他渴望赶紧摆脱那些一路净给他找麻烦的灵魂，急不可耐地远离他们的哭哭啼啼、牢骚抱怨和自怨自艾。但是这次不同。看着她走向最后的归宿，而自己却不能跟在身后，对他来说是一种痛苦和煎熬。他看到迪伦睁大了眼睛，她听懂了自己话里的意思，眼中似有泪光闪动。他转开了目光，全神贯注地看着目的地，不忍心再看她的脸。他的手指有些颤抖，握紧了桨叶，朝着最后分手的地方划去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little waves of the lake began to grow, jostling the boat gently. Tristan frowned slightly and increased the tempo of his rowing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="湖面上的波浪渐渐增强，船儿也开始轻轻颠簸起来。崔斯坦眉头微皱，加快了划水的速度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan's own mind was whirling. She was terrified of taking the next step. Tristan could give her no idea of what might lie in wait for her; he had never gone beyond the wasteland. The tiny amount of religious teaching that she had been subjected to told her that she was going on to a better place, but who knew whether that was true or not? She could be walking into anything -- heaven, hell, or perhaps just an eternity of nothingness. And she would have to make that walk -- was it a walk? -- alone. Tristan had told her that he could not go with her. At some point she was going to have to continue the journey by herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦心里乱极了，她对即将独自迈出的下一步充满恐惧。崔斯坦也给她解释不清等待她的是什么，他还从未走出过荒原。她死前接受的那点儿零零星星的宗教教义告诉她，她会到一个更完美的世界，但谁又知道这到底是真的还是假的呢？她可能会踏上任何地方—天堂、地狱，或只是永恒的虚无。而且她还将独自上路（是走着去吗？），崔斯坦之前就说过他不能一直陪她走。所以，到达某个地方之后，她将不得不独自走完剩下的旅程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan was too deep in her thoughts for the change to register. It was not merely that she would have to go on alone, but that she would have to leave Tristan. The thought caused a deep pain in her chest and tears to pool in her eyes. He had become her protector, her comfort, her friend. There were also other feelings, longings to be close to him. She felt constantly hyper-aware of him. A simple word had the ability to send her stomach erupting in butterflies, or drown her in a mire of self-doubt and sadness. At the back of her mind she wondered if this was his doing, if he was playing with her emotions to keep her under control and make his life easier, but something deep down told her it was real, and that was what she trusted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦陷入了沉思，因而感受不到这变化。她不仅必须独自一人走，还要离开崔斯坦。一想到这个，她的胸口就感到剧痛，眼中含着热泪。这些日子来他一直在保护着她、安抚着她、支持着她。她还萌生出了其他的情愫，渴望跟他在一起。她一直对他的一言一行极度敏感，只消他简单吐出一个词就可以让她心里时而七上八下、忐忑不安，时而深陷不自信与痛苦的泥潭中难以自拔。在她的潜意识中，她曾经怀疑他这样做是不是出于本意，是不是只是在利用她的感情让她老实听话，好少给他添麻烦。但是内心深处有个声音告诉她他是真心对她的，她对此深信不疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have to calm down, Dylan. Look at the weather." By now he was almost shouting over the wind. Dylan nodded at his words, but he wasn't sure that they had actually registered. They hadn't. She was looking at him, but all she saw in front of her eyes was him walking away from her, leaving her standing in a world of fear and uncertainty. Inside she screamed for him, begged him to come back, but he simply bowed his head and trudged on. Tomorrow he would leave her. Nothing else mattered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须要冷静下来，迪伦。你看看这天。”现在，他几乎是在对着风喊话了。迪伦听到后点了点头，但他不确定这番话她听进去了没有。显然是没有，她就这么看着他，眼前浮现的尽是他离开她，把她一个人撇在那个充满恐惧、前途未卜的世界时的情景。在她的想象中，她在对着他呼喊，求他回来，而他只是点了点头，然后继续走路。她只知道崔斯坦明天就会离开她了，其余什么都不重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She couldn't imagine not being with him now. It felt much longer than a few days that they had been each other's constant companion. She stared at him, drinking in the image of his face, trying to memorise every detail. Despair clouded her thoughts, and the sky seemed instantly to darken. A biting wind whipped up, stirring her hair and pulling at the jumper she wore. Dylan didn't notice; she was lost in her pain. Tristan, however, glanced nervously at the sky and rowed even more briskly. He wanted to get across the lake without incident; he knew Dylan was nervous of the water. But Dylan's emotions were working against him. The boat bobbed unevenly as the wind whisked up waves of deep troughs and white-capped peaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在她简直无法想象没有他在身边该怎么办。这几天他们一直形影不离，感觉两人好像在一起很久很久了。她注视着他，如痴如醉地看着他俊朗的容颜，尽力想把每个细节都记在心里。绝望与无助笼罩了她的思绪，天色似乎马上就要暗下来。刺骨的寒风袭来，吹乱了她的一头长发，又来拉扯她的外套。迪伦对此竟浑然不觉，完全沉浸在自己的痛苦中。但崔斯坦紧张地瞥了一眼天空，然后划得更快了。他希望不出任何意外地穿过这个湖，但迪伦此时此刻的心绪偏偏跟他作对。在她的心像作用下，狂风掀起白头大浪，船在峰谷间颠簸摇晃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The oars were useless in Tristan's hands. The lake was so choppy now that he couldn't row any more, and they were being tossed about at the mercy of the waves. Spray reared up and coated both of them in an icy shower. Beneath the surface, the water seemed to be writhing, through the turbulence of the weather or the awakening of unknown things it was impossible to tell for sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦手中的桨已经不起作用了。湖水剧烈翻腾，他没法继续划水了。他们任由巨浪抛来抛去。水花如暴跳的烈马，冰水把他们浑身都浇透了。湖面下的水似乎正在翻滚，还不能确定这到底是因为风狂浪急还是有不明生物在蠢蠢欲动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A strong gust tore through them both, pushing them violently to the side. Tristan tightened his grasp, but the rotten planks splintered and broke. The piece he was holding on to came away entirely in his hand. Losing his anchoring hold unbalanced Tristan and he crashed against the opposite side of the boat. The added weight in the choppy water disturbed the delicate equilibrium the dinghy had been maintaining in the waves. Tristan experienced a sudden weightlessness, accompanied by a sense of horror, but he was powerless to stop the boat from capsizing, and the black waves rushed to meet them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan threw himself clear, worried that the boat would come down on top of them, and dived into the water. It was freezing cold and dark. Even just below the surface, he couldn't see the sky above him. The current twisted and pulled at him, muddling his senses. He kicked blindly in the direction that he hoped was up, and seconds later broke the surface. He bobbed there for a moment, whipping his head from side to side, searching. The boat floated upside down beside him, and he darted round it to check the other side, a growing feeling of panic exploding within him. He could not lose her; not here, not to the churning waters of the lake.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan was lost. Hitting the water had shocked her out of her temporary paralysis, but she had been totally unprepared for the impact, and the cold of the water had made her gasp. Water had poured into her mouth and nose immediately. Instinct had shut down her windpipe before the liquid could pour into her lungs and choke her. She blew out the water and clamped her lips shut, but her lungs were already burning, desperate for air. Dylan tried to tell herself that her body wasn't real, didn't need to breathe. It didn't matter; her lungs continued to scream at her. She opened her eyes, which had closed of their own accord when she'd entered the lake. She could see nothing. The water stung her eyes but she forced them to stay open, hoping desperately to see the sky, or Tristan's face appear in front of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦迷失了方向。一接触到水面，她马上从刚才的麻木状态中醒过神来。但是她对落水毫无准备，冰冷的湖水让她倒吸冷气，水马上就灌进了嘴和鼻孔里。在水灌入她的肺部把她呛死之前，她出于本能闭上了气管。她用力把水排出来，然后紧闭嘴唇。但她的肺像着了火一样，急需空气。迪伦拼命告诉自己，她的身体并不真实，是不需要呼吸的。可那丝毫不起作用，她的肺继续向她告急求救。自从落水后她的眼睛一直都是自动闭上的，现在她把眼睁开，可什么也看不见。水刺得眼睛生疼，但她还是硬挺着睁着眼，在绝望中盼着能看到天空或是崔斯坦的脸出现在眼前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had always been afraid of drowning, had had nightmares about it all through her childhood. Another reason to avoid the swimming pool. The cold and lack of air weakened her, but fear kept her arms and legs fighting her unknown attackers. The need to breathe was building. Her lips were jammed together as tightly as she could hold them, but every nerve demanded she inhale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前她一直很害怕溺水，从童年时期就开始做关于溺水的噩梦，这也是她一直躲着游泳池的一个原因。冰水和缺氧让她变得四肢乏力，然而恐惧感还是驱使她的四肢继续挣扎着，反抗未知生物的袭击。呼吸的需求越来越迫切，她竭尽所能地紧锁双唇，但她的每一根神经都在要求她张嘴吸气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stormy currents pummelled her from every angle, spinning her round. She had no idea which way was up, so she swam blindly under water, hoping for a miracle. Every pull of her arm and kick of her leg was a monumental effort. The weight of her clothing dragged, and her limbs were burning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狂暴的波浪从各个角度击打着她，她在水下翻腾旋转。她不知道怎么游上去，就在水下瞎扑腾，指望奇迹发生。她每划一次胳膊、蹬一下腿都非常艰难，厚重的衣服碍手碍脚，她的四肢有种灼烧的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something rippled past her abdomen. She pulled her stomach in, expelling more precious air in the process. The thing slid along her arm, curling around it as if testing to see what it was. Another thing swam past her face, the rough texture of it scraping against her cheek. Dylan panicked and flailed wildly under the water, swatting sightlessly at invisible things. Suddenly the water became alive with writhing creatures. Terror filled her. This is it, she thought. The end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知什么东西游过了她的腹部。迪伦赶紧收缩胃部，又挤出了更多宝贵的空气。那东西顺着她的胳膊游走，像是要一探究竟似的在那里绕来绕去；还有东西游过她的脸，粗糙的表皮蹭着她的面颊。迪伦害怕极了，在水下拼命扑腾，对着那隐形的东西瞎踢乱打。突然之间，水下如同开锅滚水一般，无数生物在其中蠕动盘旋。她内心充满了恐惧感，心想它们终究还是来了，完了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Something grabbed at her hair, pulling, and the jolt and surprise caused her to forget momentarily about the need to keep her mouth closed. It dropped open and her lungs gratefully inhaled. Toxic water flooded down into her lungs. They convulsed and tried to draw in air, making Dylan cough and choke. More of the foul liquid inundated her throat and her eyes bulged in horror. Her ears popped, protesting at the depth of the water. The quick pain was replaced by a sharp ringing. A last-gasp scream appeared on her face as she began to pass out. The last thing she was aware of was one of the creatures grabbing her leg and yanking her down, down, deeper into the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知什么东西抓住了她的头发，用力拖拽，她心里一惊，一时间竟忘记了闭嘴。嘴一咧开，肺马上趁机吸气。滚滚毒水随即涌进了肺部，它们一边抽搐着，一边仍竭力想吸进空气。迪伦连咳嗽带呛水，更多的污水灌进了喉咙，眼睛惊恐地往外凸，耳朵因为入水过深而胀痛。开始是瞬间的疼痛，最后就成了尖厉的耳鸣。当她逐渐陷入昏迷的时候，脸上还带着绝望呐喊的神情。她最后只觉得有个东西拽着她的腿，猛地朝着更加幽深的湖底沉下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
