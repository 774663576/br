<div class="line_en">Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however, was muttering, "Specialis Revelio!" over his cauldron, which sounded impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏劲头十足地在坩埚上方挥舞着魔杖，可惜他们模仿不了她的魔法，因为她现在已很擅长无声咒，不用说出咒语。这时厄尼正对着他的坩埚念叨着“原形立现！”听起来挺像回事，哈利和罗恩赶紧效仿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nothing," said Harry gloomily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。”哈利沮丧地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears. Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did, and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione's expression could not have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials. More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else, Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince's book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只过了五分钟，哈利就意识到他那班上第一魔药师的名声将要毁于一旦。斯拉格霍恩第一次巡视时期待地朝他的坩埚里看了看，正准备像往常那样兴奋地欢呼，可是他立即缩回了头，被臭鸡蛋味熏得连连咳嗽。赫敏的表情得意到极点，她受够了每次魔药课上自己都被人超过。现在她正把那些神秘分离的成份小心地注入到十个不同的小水晶瓶里。哈利为了避免看到这恼人的情形，只好埋头去看混血王子的书，他猛地翻了几页。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn't he once, long ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn't Snape mentioned them in their firstever Potions lesson? "A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which will protect from most poisons."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不是戈巴洛特问题的答案，如果这课还是斯内普教，哈利也不敢这么做，但此刻他顾不得了。他冲向储藏柜，推开独角兽角和一堆堆干草药，在里面胡乱地翻找着，终于在最里面找到了一个小硬纸盒，上面潦草地写着“粪石”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="斯拉格霍恩叫道：“还有两分钟，各位！”哈利打开盒子，看到了六块皱缩的褐色物体，与其说像石头，不如说像干腰子。他拿了一块，把盒子放回柜中，快步走回坩埚旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before Slughorn reached her.

Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.</div>

Purplish-gray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy.

Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout -- the Heads of Houses -- and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.</div>

Although he consulted the map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual, sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very high level of security now operating within the castle. He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got older -- Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living proof.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part of him -- the part closest to his throbbing right ear -- was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off… But on the other hand, they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利瞪着倒挂着的罗恩，瞪着那张现在带着无限渴望的面孔，忍住一阵强烈的笑意。他的一部分——最靠近灼痛的右耳的那部分——很想把罗恩放下来，看他去发疯，一直到药力消失。可另一方面，他们还是朋友，罗恩打他时是神志失常的。哈利想，如果他让罗恩去向罗米达·万尼表达不朽的爱情，他就真该再挨一拳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't mention it, m"boy, don't mention it," said Slughorn, as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. "Pick-me-up, that's what he needs," Slughorn continued, now bustling over to a table loaded with drinks. "I've got butterbeer, I've got wine, I've got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead… hmm… meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas… ah, well…" He shrugged.
