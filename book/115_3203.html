<div class="line_en">"Wait a minute, Mr Favell," said Colonel Julyan quietly, "you were present at the inquiry this afternoon, weren't you? I remember you now. I saw you sitting there. If you felt so deeply about the injustice of the verdict why didn't you say so then, to the jury, to the Coroner himself? Why didn't you produce that letter in court?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Thank God for Favell's laugh. Thank God for his pointing finger, his flushed face, his staring bloodshot eyes. Thank God for the way he stood there swaying on his two feet. Because it made Colonel Julyan antagonistic, it put him on our side. I saw the disgust on his face, the quick movement of his lips. Colonel Julyan did not believe him. Colonel Julyan was on our side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="感谢上帝！幸亏费弗尔纵声大笑，幸亏他伸出手指点戳，脸涨得像猪肝，瞪着充血的双眼，也幸亏这家伙站着不住地摇晃身子。这一切使朱利安上校开始带着敌意看待此人，并站在我们这一边来。我看见上校脸上显出极度憎恶的神色，双辱不住地抖动。朱利安上校不相信他的话；朱利安上校站在我们一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Drunk, am I?" shouted Favell. "Oh, no, my fine friend. You may be a magistrate and a colonel into the bargain, but it won't cut any ice with me. I've got the law on my side for a change, and I'm going to use it. There are other magistrates in this bloody county besides you. Fellows with brains in their heads, who understand the meaning of justice. Not soldiers who got the sack years ago for incompetence and walk about with a string of putty medals on their chest. Max de Winter murdered Rebecca and I'm going to prove it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我喝醉了？”费弗尔大声嚷嚷。“啊，不，我的好朋友！你也许是个行政官，外加上校军衔，可是这对我一点没什么两样。这一回跟以前不同啦，法律在我这一边，我可决不错过机会。这一地区除了你，还有好几个行政官呢！那些人有头脑，也懂得法律的含义，可不像那些因为无能而在多年前被一脚踢出军队的老兵，胸前挂满微不足道的勋章，到处招摇过市。迈克斯—德温特杀了吕蓓卡，我会证明这一罪孽的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, of course," said Colonel Julyan, "the trouble is that blackmail is not very pure, nor is it particularly simple. It can make a lot of unpleasantness for a great many people, even if the blackmailer finds himself in jail at the end of it. Sometimes innocent people find themselves in jail as well. We want to avoid that, in this case. I don't know whether you are sufficiently sober, Favell, to answer my questions, and if you keep off irrelevant personalities we may get through with the business quicker. You have just made a serious accusation against de Winter. Have you any proof to back that accusation?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，一点不错，”朱利安上校说。“问题在于讹诈这玩意儿从来不是纯粹的，也谈不上直截了当。搞讹诈的人即使到头来弄得坐牢完事，也会给许多人带来莫大的难堪。不过，有时清白人也会遭缧绁之灾。在这个案子里，我们将尽量不使这种情况出现。费弗尔，我不知道你此刻是否已经酒醒，能不能以正常的神志回答我的问题。要是你不再生拉硬扯，胡乱进行人身攻击，我们才有可能把整个案子及早弄个水落石出。刚才，你对德温特提出一个严重的指控。请问你可有任何证据，来作为此项指控的后盾？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's perfectly true, sir," said Frank. "It's blackmail, pure and simple."</div>

<div class="line_en">Favell stared at him, and laughed. "Why?" he said, "because I did not choose to, that's why. I preferred to come and tackle de Winter personally."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费弗尔瞪眼望着他，边笑边说：“为什么？因为我不想这么干。这就是原因。我情愿到这儿来，亲自跟德温特谈一谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's why I rang you up," said Maxim, coming forward from the window; "we've already heard Favell's accusations. I asked him the same question. Why didn't he tell his suspicions to the Coroner? He said he was not a rich man, and that if I cared to settle two or three thousand on him for life he would never worry me again. Frank was here, and my wife. They both heard him. Ask them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我给你打电话的原因也正在于此，”迈克西姆从窗口走近几步说。“费弗尔的指控我们都已听说过了。我向他提出了同样的话题：为什么不把自己的怀疑告诉验尸官？他说他不是富翁，倘若我同意向他提供每年两三千镑的款项，了他此生，他就不来打扰我。当时，弗兰克在场，我妻子也在场。他们两人都听到的。你问他们好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Kerrith has a large population," said Colonel Julyan. "Why not go from door to door making inquiries? I might have done it myself. You appear to have no more proof against de Winter there than you would have against me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克里斯有很多居民，”朱利安上校说。“你怎么不去挨家挨户调查呢？换了我就可能这么做。如果说你手里掌握的证据可以用来对付德温特，那么同样也可以用来对付我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certainly not," said Colonel Julyan, "unless you can bring a witness who saw him do it. Where's your witness?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You think you can get the better of me, don't you? You think I've got no case to bring to a court of law. I'll get my proof for you all right. I tell you de Winter killed Rebecca because of me. He knew I was her lover; he was jealous, madly jealous. He knew she was waiting for me at the cottage on the beach, and he went down that night and killed her. Then he put her body in the boat and sank her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你以为这样一来就能把我压倒吗？你以为我没法到法院去起诉吧？我会把证据摊在你面前的。告诉你，德温特因为恨我而杀死了吕蓓卡。他知道我是她的情人，他妒嫉，发疯般地妒嫉。他打听到她在海滩小屋等我，于是就乘黑夜跑去，杀了吕蓓卡。接着，他把尸体拖上帆船，把船凿沉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I see," said Favell, "you're going to hold his hand through this. You're going to back de Winter. You won't let him down because you've dined with him, and he's dined with you. He's a big name down here. He's the owner of Manderley. You poor bloody little snob."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是这样，”费弗尔说。“原来你准备自始至终扶他一把，你是打定主意当德温特的后盾了。你是他的座上客，他是你的酒肉朋友，这一来你就护着他了。他是这一带的名人，曼陀丽的庄园主。你这该死的势利鬼，卑劣的小人！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite a clever story, Favell, in its way, but I repeat again you have no proof. Produce your witness who saw it happen and I might begin to take you seriously. I know that cottage on the beach. A sort of picnic place, isn't it? Mrs de Winter used to keep the gear there for the boat. It would help your story if you could turn it into a bungalow with fifty replicas alongside of it. There would be a chance then that one of the inhabitants might have seen the whole affair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“费弗尔，你的故事编得相当巧妙，不过我得再说一遍：你没有证据。找个目击者做你的证人，这样我也许才会认真看待你的指控。我知道海滩小屋，那屋子不是用来野餐的吗？德温特夫人还把它作为堆放船帆索具的地方。要是你能把那小屋变作一所普通的平房，左近有五十所同样的房屋住着人，那倒多少能证实你刚才的故事哩，只有这样，左邻右舍中才可能有人目击事情的经过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hold on," said Favell slowly, "hold on… There is a chance de Winter might have been seen that night. Quite a good chance too. It's worth finding out. What would you say if I did produce a witness?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一等，”费弗尔慢悠悠地说。“等一等…德温特那天夜里可能确实遭人撞见了。可能性还不小呢！值得查一查。要是我找到一个证人，你怎么说？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Colonel Julyan shrugged his shoulders. I saw Frank glance inquiringly at Maxim. Maxim did not say anything. He was watching Favell. I suddenly knew what Favell meant. I knew who he was talking about. And in a flash of fear and horror I knew that he was right. There had been a witness that night. Little sentences came back to me. Words I had not understood, phrases I believed to be the fragments of a poor idiot's mind. "She's down there isn't she? She won't come back again." "I didn't tell no one." "They'll find her there, won't they? The fishes have eaten her, haven't they?" "She'll not come back no more." Ben knew. Ben had seen. Ben, with his queer crazed brain, had been a witness all the time. He had been hiding in the woods that night. He had seen Maxim take the boat from the moorings, and pull back in the dinghy, alone. I knew all the colour was draining away from my face. I leant back against the cushion of the chair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朱利安上校耸耸肩。我看到弗兰克以询问的目光扫了迈克西姆一眼，迈克西姆则一声不吭，只是一个劲儿盯着费弗尔看。突然，我明白费弗尔的意思了，我知道他说的是谁。一阵惶恐之中，我不得不承认他是对的。那天夜里确实有个目击者，我又想起零星的片言只语。那些话的含义当初我不理解，还以为是一个可怜的白痴头脑里互不连贯的呓语。“她在那下面，对吗？不再回来了。”“我没对人讲过。”“他们会在那儿找到她的，对不对？鱼儿把她吃了，是不是？”“她永远不会再回来了。”贝恩知道，贝恩看见的。贝思虽然神志失常，疯疯癫癫，可始终是个目击者。那天夜里，他一定藏在林子里，样眼看见迈克西姆解缆开船，后来又独自划着橡皮筏子从海上回来。我感到自己脸上唰地没了一点血色，于是赶快一仰头背靠着垫子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What the hell does that matter?" said Favell. "He's got eyes, hasn't he? He knows what he sees. He's only got to answer yes or no. You're getting windy now, aren't you? Not so mighty confident?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那他妈的有什么关系？”费弗尔说。“他不也长着一双眼睛？他知道自己看见了什么。只要让他回答“是’或‘不’就行了。这下你们害怕了，是不是？不再那么信心十足了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's a local half-wit who spends his time on the beach," said Favell. "He was always hanging about, when I used to come down and meet Rebecca. I've often seen him. He used to sleep in the woods, or on the beach when the nights were hot. The fellow's cracked, he would never have come forward on his own. But I could make him talk if he did see anything that night. And there's a bloody big chance he did."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这一带有个低能儿，老是在海滩闲逛，”费弗尔说。“那时我常来曼陀丽和吕蓓卡幽会，此人就在这一带出没，我常见到他。闷热天气，他老是在树林里或是海滩上过夜。这小子神经有点毛病，所以决不会自动站出来作证。可是如果那天夜里他的确看见了什么，我有办法让他说实话，而被他撞见的可能性还真他妈不小呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course," said Maxim. "Tell Robert to cut down to his mother's cottage, Frank, and bring him back."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go on, for God's sake," said Maxim. "We want to end this thing, don't we?" Frank went out of the room. I began to feel the old nagging pain beneath my heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快去，看到上帝份上，”迈克西姆说。“我们难道不想把这件事快点了结吗？”弗兰克遵命走出屋去。这时我那心口灼痛的老毛病又犯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The rain will keep him at home all right," said Favell; "he'll be there. And I think you will find I shall be able to make him talk." He laughed, and looked at Maxim. His face was still very flushed. Excitement had made him sweat; there were beads of perspiration on his forehead. I noticed how his neck bulged over the back of his collar, and how low his ears were set on his head. Those florid good looks would not last him very long. Already he was out of condition, puffy. He helped himself to another cigarette. "You're like a little trade union here at Manderley, aren't you?" he said; "no one going to give anyone else away. Even the local magistrate is on the same racket. We must exempt the bride of course. A wife doesn't give evidence against her husband. Crawley of course has been squared. He knows he would lose his job if he told the truth. And if I guess rightly there's a spice of malice in his soul towards me too. You didn't have much success with Rebecca, did you, Crawley? That garden path wasn't quite long enough, eh? It's a bit easier this time, isn't it. The bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm every time she faints. When she hears the judge sentence her husband to death that arm of yours will come in very handy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“下雨天他肯定在家，”费弗尔说。“不会出去的。我会让你们各位看我如何使这人开口。”他笑着看看迈克西姆，仍然涨红了脸。他激动得浑身冒热气，黄豆般的汗珠挂了一头。我注意到这人颈背上的肥肉都堆在衣领外面，耳朵又长得特别低。那种花花公子般的好相貌寿命不长了。此人已经肥得不成样子，浑身都是赘肉。他又拿了一支烟。“你们几位在这儿像是组织了一个小小的帮派，”他说。“谁都不肯出卖别人。连地方上的行政官也入了伙。不过我们当然不能把新娘子算在里头。做妻子的哪有提供证词反对丈夫之理？克劳利无疑捞了不少好处，他也明白要是实话实说，就非砸饭碗不可。要是我没猜铝，在他灵魂深处对我还有一点嫉恨呢。克劳利，当年你在吕蓓卡身上没得到多少好处，对不，花园里的幽径是不是还不够长？这一回倒是容易些了，是不是？新娘子一晕倒，总是对你的殷勤扶持感激不尽。等她听到判处她丈夫死刑那会儿，你的手臂倒是现成的支持呐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And Maxim was standing just beside him. I felt rather sick. There was something degrading in the fact that Maxim had hit Favell. I wished I had not known. I wished I had not been there to see. Colonel Julyan did not say anything. He looked very grim. He turned his back on them and came and stood beside me.</div>

He mixed some in a glass and gave it to Favell. Favell drank it greedily, like an animal. There was something sensual and horrible the way he put his mouth to the glass. His lips folded upon the glass in a peculiar way. There was a dark red patch on his jaw where Maxim had hit him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank went back into the little room to give the message. I thought of the daughter at the other end of the telephone. It would be the one who played golf. I could imagine her calling to her sister, "Dad says we're to start. What on earth can he be doing? The steak will be like leather." Their little household disorganized because of us. Their evening routine upset. All these foolish inconsequent threads hanging upon one another, because Maxim had killed Rebecca. I looked at Frank. His face was pale and set.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克走到小房间去回话。我想象着线路那一头的姑娘，大概就是爱打高尔夫球的那一位吧。我想象着她在大声对妹妹说：“爸让我们先吃。他究竟干什么去了？排骨一冷会老得没法咬呢。”那边一个小小的家庭今晚也乱了套，他家的作息规矩被我们打破了。所有这些无足轻重的小事，一件接一件，互为因果，而归根结蒂都是因为迈克西姆杀了吕蓓卡。我朝弗兰克看看，他的脸色苍白，表情严峻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went out of the library to the hall. Favell had lifted his head when he spoke. Then he got to his feet once more and stood looking towards the door. There was a queer ugly smile on his face.</div>

<div class="line_en">The light seemed to daze him. He glanced foolishly round the room, blinking his small eyes. He caught sight of me, and I gave him a weak, rather tremulous smile. I don't know if he recognized me or not. He just blinked his eyes. Then Favell walked slowly towards him and stood in front of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里的灯光像是照花了他的眼。他痴呆地环顾房间，不住地眨巴小眼睛。他的眼光落在我身上，我报以心神不定的淡淡一笑，可不知他是否认出了我。他只是死命地眨眼睛。费弗尔慢慢向他走去，在他面前站定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ben stepped awkwardly into the room. He had his sou'wester in his hands. He looked odd and naked without his hat. I realized for the first time that his head was shaved all over, and he had no hair. He looked different, dreadful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝恩手足无措地走进屋来，双手捧着水手帽。因为没戴帽子，这人显得光秃秃的，完全变了样。我第一次看到，原来他的头剃得精光滴溜，一根头发也没有。贝恩这会儿看上去真是变了样，一个十足的丑八怪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你这该死的糊涂蛋加骗子手，”费弗尔说。“你敢站在我面前胡说八道吗？去年，我同德温特夫人一起在林子里散步，一起走进小屋，你敢说没看见吗？有一次你从窗口偷看，我们俩不是这着你了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

This time it was I who got up and went towards the window. It seemed to me that it was no longer raining quite so hard. The fury was spent. The rain that was falling now had a quieter, softer note. The grey light of evening had come into the sky. The lawns were dark and drenched with the heavy rain, and the trees had a shrouded humped appearance. I could hear the housemaid overhead drawing the curtains for the night, shutting down the windows that had not been closed already. The little routine of the day going on inevitably as it had always done. The curtains drawn, shoes taken down to be cleaned, the towel laid out on the chair in the bathroom, and the water run for my bath. Beds turned down, slippers put beneath a chair.

<div class="line_en">"Try every exchange in London," jeered Favell. "It will take you through the night but we don't mind. Max doesn't care if his telephone bill is a hundred pounds, do you, Max? You want to play for time, and so should I, if I were in your shoes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“试着给伦敦的电话局一个一个去联系吧，”费弗尔讪笑不已。“这够你忙一晚上的，咱们反正不在乎，迈克斯也不在乎他的电话费账单是不是超过一百镑大关，我说得对吗？迈克斯？你是巴不得拖时间呢，不过换了我处在你的地位，我也会耍同样的把戏。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Favell gave a great cackle of laughter. "The butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker, they all jumped out of a rotten potato," he said. "Carry on, detective Number One, what's the next exchange on the list?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费弗尔发出一声嘶哑的笑声。“各行各业的人都得挨个儿问一遍呐。他们都会从个个烂山芋里蹦出来的，”他说。“接着干吧，天字第一号大侦探，接下来跟哪一区的电话局联系啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little click as he replaced the receiver. Then he came back into the room. "Someone called Lady Eastleigh lives at Mayfair 0488. It's an address in Grosvenor Street. They've never heard of Baker."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着传来他把电话筒放回原处的卡嗒声。然后他走回房间来。“梅费厄0488号的住户名叫依斯特莱夫人。这架电话设在格鲁斯维纳大街。那儿的人从未听说过贝克。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The farce was repeated all over again. Colonel Julyan repeated his walk up and down the room. Another five minutes went by, and the telephone rang again. Frank went to answer it.

<div class="line_en">Oh, God, don't let it be true. Don't let Baker be found. Please God make Baker be dead. I knew who Baker was. I had known all along. I watched Frank through the door, I watched him lean forward suddenly, reach for a pencil and a piece of paper. "Hullo? Yes, I'm still here. Could you spell it? Thank you. Thank you very much. Good night." He came back into the room, the piece of paper in his hands. Frank who loved Maxim, who did not know that the piece of paper he held was the one shred of evidence that was worth a damn in the whole nightmare of our evening, and that by producing it he could destroy Maxim as well and truly as though he had a dagger in his hand and stabbed him in the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哦，上帝，但愿这不是真的，但愿别找到贝克。求求您，上帝，但愿贝克已经死了。我知道贝克是何许人物，打一开始就知道。我眼睁睁看着门那一边的弗兰克，见他突然俯下身去，取过一支铅笔和一张纸片。“喂？对，我听着。请你告诉我怎么拼写。谢谢，非常感谢。晚安。”他拿着那张纸回到房间里。弗兰克，你不是深深敬爱迈克西姆吗？你还蒙在鼓里，殊不知你手里的这张纸片就是今天这该死的夜晚唯一有价值的证据，一旦把它交出来，你就毁了迈克西姆，就好像你手里拿的是一把匕首，准备在背后猛戳一刀，把迈克西姆真正干掉完事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was the night porter from an address in Bloomsbury," he said. "There are no residents there at all. The place is used during the day as a doctor's consulting rooms.
