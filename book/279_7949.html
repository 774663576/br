<div class="line_en">On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure–hunting. When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weed–grown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期六中午刚过不久，两个孩子又来到那棵死树旁。他俩先在树荫下抽了一会烟，聊了几句，然后又在剩下的一个洞里继续挖了几锹。当然这样做并非出于抱有多大的希望，只是因为汤姆说过有许多回挖宝的人离宝只有六寸，结果还是让别的人一锹就给挖走了。不过，这一次他俩没那么幸运，于是他们就扛起工具走了，他们很看重财宝，而且就挖宝而言，他们已尽了最大的努力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look up–stairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result-they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud-there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when --</div>

<div class="line_en">The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs-the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads-they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:</div>

They were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much absorbed in hating themselves-hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his "revenge" was satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there!</div>
