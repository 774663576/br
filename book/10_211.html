<div class="line_en">About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne forth again. A company of twenty was approaching. At the beginning of the narrow way they laid aside sword and spear, and came on towards the Gate. Wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron-bound wood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约中午时，森林与长湖联军的旗帜再度出阵，大约二十人的一支队伍朝他门走过来。在窄道的头上他们就放下了刀剑与长矛，然后继续朝着宫殿大门走来。矮人们正有点摸不着头脑，却看见巴德和精灵国王都在队伍中，走在他们前面的是一名浑身裹着斗篷与兜帽的老者，手里捧一只箍着铁环的木匣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That will be Dain!" said Thorin when he heard. "They will have got wind of his coming. I thought that would alter their mood! Bid them come few in number and weaponless, and I will hear," he called to the messenger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“准是戴因来了！”索林一听完就如此说道，“他们一定风闻了他正赶来的消息。哼，我就知道这会让他们改变态度！叫他们少来几个人，不准带武器，我会见他们的。”索林对着信使喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along the narrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come to hand, and matters were changed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，对面的营盘中早早地便响起了号角声。不多久，便见一位信使沿着狭窄的小路向他们奔来。在一段距离之外，信使站定向他们挥手示意，问他们索林是否愿意再次接见来使，因为传来了新的消息，令事情发生了改变。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns," answered Thorin. "Did you come to ask me idle questions? Still the elf-host has not departed as I bade! Till then you come in vain to bargain with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的心意不会在区区几次日升日落之间就更改！”索林回答道，“你就是跑来问我这种无聊问题的吗？精灵部队还是没有按照我的要求撤退！不撤兵，你们就别白费力气跑来找我谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke for a long while. Thorin at length broke the silence, and his voice was thick with wrath. "That stone was my father's, and is mine," he said. "Why should I purchase my own?" But wonder overcame him and he added: "But how came you by the heirloom of my house-if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终还是索林先打破了寂静，只听他怒气冲冲地质问道：“这颗宝石是我父亲的，因而也是我的，我为什么要以黄金来换取自己的东西呢？”不过好奇心战胜了他，让他忍不住追问了一句：“你们是怎么得到我家的传家之宝的——如果还需要问一下谁是小偷的话？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?" said he, and at the same moment the old man opened the casket and held aloft the jewel. The light leapt from his hand, bright and white in the morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You! You!" cried Thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both hands. "You miserable hobbit! You undersized-burglar!" he shouted at a loss for words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你！你！”索林转身来到他跟前，伸出双手揪住了他。“你这个该死的霍比特人！你这个小矬——飞贼！”他急切间想不出适当的词来骂，只能抓住可怜的比尔博把他像只兔子一样死命摇晃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You all seem in league!" said Thorin dropping Bilbo on the top of the wall. "Never again will I have dealings with any wizard or his friends. What have you to say, you descendant of rats?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来你们都串通好了！”索林说着把比尔博扔在了墙头上，“我以后再也不跟巫师或是巫师的朋友打交道了。你这个鼠辈，还有什么话好说？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dear me! Dear me!" said Bilbo. "I am sure this is all very uncomfortable. You may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share? Perhaps I took it too literally-I have been told that dwarves are sometimes politer in word than in deed. The time was, all the same, when you seemed to think that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this all the service of you and your family that I was promised, Thorin? Take it that I have disposed of my share as I wished, and let it go at that!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎哟妈呀！哎哟妈呀！”比尔博说，“我就知道会很不舒服的。你还记得自己曾经说过，我可以自己挑选我那份十四分之一的财宝吧？也许我把这话太当真了——有人告诉过我，矮人们的客气只是口头上的，行动上却未必！看来这话只是你在认为我还有利用价值时才说的。鼠辈？说得好啊！这难道就是你许下的你和你家人世世代代要还我的人情吗，索林？就把这当做是我按自己的意愿处置了我应得的那份，这事儿就这样算了吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stay! Your wish is granted!" said a voice. The old man with the casket threw aside his hood and cloak. "Here is Gandalf! And none too soon it seems. If you don't like my Burglar, please don't damage him. Put him down, and listen first to what he has to say!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“住手！你的愿望可以实现了！”一个声音传来。拿着木匣的老者一把扯下了兜帽和斗篷。“甘道夫在此！而且看来来得正是时候。如果你不喜欢我挑选的飞贼，请你也不要伤害他。把他放下，听听他想说些什么！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!" he cried and lifted Bilbo in his arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will," said Thorin grimly. "And I will let you go at that-and may we never meet again!" Then he turned and spoke over the wall. "I am betrayed," he said. "It was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, setting aside the gems; but that shall be accounted the promised share of this traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will. He will get little enough, I doubt not. Take him, if you wish him to live; and no friendship of mine goes with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以，”索林用阴沉的声音说道，“我也可以放过你，希望我们以后再也不要再见了！”接着他转身对墙外说：“我被出卖了！你们的估计没错，我不可能不赎回我的阿肯宝钻。为了换回这颗宝石，我愿意付出宝藏中金银的十四分之一，宝石除外。不过这应该算成是我承诺给这个叛徒的分成，拿了这份报酬后他必须离开，你们想怎么分就怎么分。他不会分到多少的，我对此毫不怀疑。把他带走吧，如果你们想要让他活着的话，我从此跟他义断情绝！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They may indeed," said Thorin. And already, so strong was the bewilderment of the treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确还有可能会改变。”索林说。由于对财宝的执念已经迷乱了他的本性，所以他心中想的其实是，依靠着戴因的帮助，他或许能重新夺回阿肯宝钻，而且还能扣下他已经应承给比尔博的酬劳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Be off!" called Thorin. "You have mail upon you, which was made by my folk, and is too good for you. It cannot be pierced by arrows; but if you do not hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be swift!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快滚！”索林喝道，“你身上穿着我同胞打造的盔甲，这盔甲你实在是不配用。虽然弓箭射不穿它，可要是你不赶快消失，我就要射你该死的脚了。快滚！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already. More than one of the dwarves in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，比尔博从高墙上被吊了下来。在经历了这么多的磨难之后，他除了索林已经给了他的那身盔甲之外，两手空空地离开了。有好几个矮人对他的离去在心中感到羞愧和惋惜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Farewell!" he cried to them. "We may meet again as friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再见啦！”他对矮人们喊道，“我们还会以朋友的身份再见的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not so hasty!" said Bard. "We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will return, and see if you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. If that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别这么着急！”巴德说，“我们给你的最后期限是明天。我们明天中午会回来，确认你是否从宝藏中拿出了与宝石价值相等的金银。如果你没有玩花样，我们就会离开，精灵部队也会回到森林。现在，我们先告退了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Roäc telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完，他们就回营地去了，但索林通过罗阿克派遣信使，将发生的一切告诉戴因，并请他火速赶来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark and gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp. Runners came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He had hurried on through the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they had expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs were covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal mesh, the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain's people. The dwarves are exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were strong even for dwarves. In battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them had also a short broad sword at his side and a roundshield slung at his back. Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were grim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天连同晚上很快就过去了。第二天吹起了西风，天空变得晦暗而又阴沉。天还蒙蒙亮的时候，营地里便响起一声叫喊，传信的士兵跑来报告，说有一群矮人出现在了孤山的东角，正往山谷突进。戴因已经到了！他经过了一夜的急行军，在对手预料的时间之前赶到了山谷。每名矮人都披挂着长及膝盖的纯钢锁子甲，腿部则用精致而有弹性的金属网格软甲覆盖，这种软甲只有戴因一族矮人才打造得出来。矮人相对他们的身高来说已经是不同寻常的健硕了，可这些矮人的强壮程度在矮人中都是佼佼者。他们在战场上作战时双手持沉重的鹤嘴锄，但每人腰间还別了一柄短剑，背上挂一面小圆盾。他们的胡子都分成几股，编成辫子，然后塞进腰带中。所有人都头戴铁盔、脚蹬铁靴，一脸肃杀之气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Trumpets called men and elves to arms. Before long the dwarves could be seen coming up the valley at a great pace. They halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing the river drew near the camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their hands in sign of peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="号角声响起，精灵和人类纷纷拿起武器，没过多久，他们就可以看见矮人急行以极快的速度向山谷走来。部队在河边和孤山的东坡之间停了下来，但有一小部分继续前进，渡过河流向营地走近。到了营地面前时，他们放下武器，高举双手以示和平。巴德出来接见他们，比尔博也一起跟了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are sent from Dain son of Nain," they said when questioned. "We are hastening to our kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. But who are you that sit in the plain as foes before defended walls?" This, of course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned language of such occasions, meant simply: "You have no business here. We are going on, so make way or we shall fight you!" They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the river; for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“纳因之子戴因派我们前来，”在被问到身份的时候，他们这样答道，“我们急着赶去和山中的同胞会合，因为我们听说昔日的国度已经被收复了。可是，你们这些在平原以敌人的姿态摆出攻城阵势的人又是谁呢？”当然，这只是这种情形下双方老掉牙的客套话，说白了就是：“这儿没你们什么事儿，我们要过路，你们最好乖乖让路，不然我们就不客气了！”他们想要在山脉与河曲之间继续推进，因为那片狭窄土地的防守似乎并不坚固。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the Mountain. He was determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought out in exchange for the Arkenstone; for he did not believe that this would be done, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company. They had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry very heavy burdens, and nearly all of Dain's folk, in spite of their rapid march, bore huge packs on their backs in addition to their weapons. They would stand a siege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more, for Thorin had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not sufficient numbers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴德理所当然地拒绝让这些矮人直接进山，他决定要固守到山中的矮人送出交换宝钻的金银之后才让步，因为他不相信一旦堡垒中驻进了这么一大帮好斗的战士后，这笔交易还能达成。这群矮人随身携带了大量的给养。矮人们能背很重的东西，戴因的这批手下虽然刚经过急行军，但几乎个个都除了武器之外还背着巨大的背包。光这些就足够他们支撑好几星期的围困了，而在此期间又会有更多的矮人会赶来，此后又会有更多，因为索林有许多的亲族。人多了之后就可以重新打开其他的山门并派兵防守，届时围困方就必须要将整座大山团团围住才行，而这样一来他们的兵力就捉襟见肘了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Elvenking said: "Long will I tarry, ere I begin this war for gold. The dwarves cannot pass us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark. Let us hope still for something that will bring reconciliation. Our advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但精灵国王却说：“在开始这场为黄金而打的战争之前，我宁愿一等再等。除非我们愿意，否则矮人们没有办法从我们这儿过去，或是做出任何我们注意不到的事情来。我们还是寄希望于出现妥协的契机，即便最后无法避免兵刃相见，我们在人数上的优势也还是足够大的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fools!" laughed Bard, "to come thus beneath the Mountain's arm! They do not understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. There are many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the rocks upon their right flank. Dwarf-mail may be good, but they will soon be hard put to it. Let us set on them now from both sides, before they are fully rested!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“愚蠢的家伙！”巴德笑道，“竟然在山坡下行军！不管他们对于矿井里的战斗懂得多少，但他们对地面上的战斗可真是一无所知。我们有许多弓箭手和长矛兵都埋伏在他们右侧的岩石后面。矮人的盔甲也许很棒，可一会还是有得他们够受的。现在让我们趁他们立足未稳，给他们来个两面夹攻！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been busy between Thorin and Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words the dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their beards. Bard then sent messengers at once to the Gate; but they found no gold or payment. Arrows came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of Dain were advancing along the eastern bank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这其实正是矮人们的计划（因为渡鸦信使一直在索林和戴因之间频繁传信），但眼下去路被挡了，于是矮人信使们在扔下一些气话后，也只好在胡子里嘀咕着退回去了。巴德接下来马上派使者到大门口去看，结果什么黄金财宝都没发现。他们一踏进射程，箭矢就飞了过来，逼得他们只好失望地逃回来。此时营地里也全都骚动起来，似乎开战在即，因为戴因的矮人部队正沿河东岸推进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black cloud hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the Mountain, and lightning lit its peak.

<div class="line_en">So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North. Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares upon the South. Then they learned of the death of Smaug, and joy was in their hearts; and they hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew of their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not expected this sudden assault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，一场意料之外的战斗开始了，这场战斗被后世称为“五军之战”，整个过程异常惨烈。一边是半兽人和野狼所组成的部队，另一边则是精灵、人类和矮人们所组成的联军。事情的缘由是这样的：在迷雾山脉的半兽人头领被杀死之后，他们对矮人的仇恨重又熊熊燃起，信使们不停地往来于他们所占据的城市、殖民地和要塞，最终他们决定这次要征服整个北方大陆。半兽人们以极其秘密的方式搜集情报，在所有的大山里锻造兵器，武装人员，然后在丘陵与山谷间行军、聚集，或走地底隧道，或以夜色为掩护，直到最后在北方的贡达巴德大山之下（那里也是他们的都城所在）集结了一支大军，准备趁着暴风雨季出其不意地横扫南方。这时，他们得知了恶龙史矛革的死讯，心中不由得大喜，接着便在群山间夜复一夜地急行军，几乎是踩着戴因的脚后跟突然间便从北方杀到了此地。就连渡鸦也是直到他们踏上孤山与其他丘陵之间的平地后，才发觉他们的行迹。甘道夫对此知道多少不好说，但显然这场突然袭击也出乎他的意料。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves were set; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves. But Bard and some of the nimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a view to the North. Soon they could see the lands before the Mountain's feet black with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing into Dale. These were the swiftest wolf-riders, and already their cries and howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before the rest drew back and fled to either side. As Gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had gathered behind the resisted vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving wildly up between the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Their banners were countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在南坡，精灵们在山脚的岩石间与稍微上面一点的斜坡上布置好了兵力；在东坡设伏的是人类和矮人。但巴德和一些最灵活敏捷的人类及精灵，则爬到东边的山岭上去侦察北面的情况。很快他们就看见山脚下的平原上黑压压的全是快速行进的半兽人。不久之后，敌方的前锋就涌过了谷口，向着山谷内冲来。这些前锋都是速度最快的狼骑兵，他们的呼喝声与野狼的狂嗥已经撕裂了远处的空气。一小部分勇敢散开在他们的正面，佯作抵抗。许多人倒下了，其余的人则后撤，逃向了两边的山坡。正如同甘道夫所希望的那样，半兽人大军集结在遭遇抵抗的前锋后面，狂怒地冲进了山谷，在东坡和南坡之间狼奔豕突，寻找着敌人。他们红黑色的旗帜多到难以计数，部队像一股怒潮般杂乱无章地奔涌着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This is the plan that he made in council with the Elven-king and with Bard; and with Dain, for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten. Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there was no time to make any other plan, or to summon any help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，他便与精灵国王和巴德一起商讨作战计划，当然也有戴因，因为这位矮人的首领现在已经与他们为伍了。由于半兽人是大家的公敌，因此他们在大兵压境之时，把所有的争执都抛到九霄云外去了。联军惟一的希望是引诱半兽人深入孤山两个支脉之间的谷地，而他们自己则把兵力布置在山脉的东坡和南坡上。然而这样的策略也是很危险的，如果半兽人人数众多，冲出包围圈杀进了山里，便可以从背后和上方同时向守军发起进攻，令守军腹背受敌。然而，已经没有时间再去拟订其他的作战计划，或去召集任何援兵了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo's experiences, and the one which at the time he hated most-which is to say it was the one he was most proud of, and most fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on his ring early in the business, and vanished from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is not a complete protection in a goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows and wild spears; but it does help in getting out of the way, and it prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一场惨烈无比的战斗。它是比尔博有生以来经历过的最可怕的一场战斗，也是当时让他最痛恨的一场——也就是说这是最令他感到骄傲、最喜欢在日后回忆起的一场战斗，尽管他在其中所起的作用很不重要。事实上，我可以说他在战斗刚一打响就戴上了他的戒指，躲过了所有人的视线，不过却不见得躲过了所有的危险。在半兽人部队的冲锋中，这样的魔戒并不能够提供完全的保护，也无法阻挡住飞来的箭矢和胡乱戳来的长矛，不过，魔戒还是可以让他不挡着对战双方的路，以防他的脑袋成为半兽人剑手有心挑选的劈刺目标。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them. As soon as the host of their enemies was dense in the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and each flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks were stained black with goblin blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with renewed numbers. Already many of the goblins were flying back down the river to escape from the trap; and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and rending the dead and the wounded. Victory seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the heights above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半兽人陷入了恐慌，而就在他们掉转身来迎接新的攻击时，精灵们在补充兵力后再次发起了冲锋。许多半兽人已经开始朝河边拼命逃窜，想要逃出陷阱，许多他们自己的野狼也兽性爆发，撕扯起半兽人的死尸和伤兵来。胜利眼看便唾手可得，孰料这时，从山顶上传来了一阵令人心寒的呼喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just as the goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rose from across the valley a deep-throated roar.

<div class="line_cn" title="就在精灵部队停止了冲锋，半兽人从受到的猛攻中稍稍稳住阵脚时，山谷间响起了一片低沉的吼声。随着一声声“墨瑞亚！”和“戴因！戴因！”的呼喊，铁丘陵的矮人们又挥舞着鹤嘴锄从另外一边跃入了战团，在他们身边与他们并肩作战的则是手拿长剑来自长湖镇的人类。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were on the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to attack the spurs from above.

<div class="line_en">Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs came ravening and with them came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the Eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill.</div>

Soon the attackers were attacked, and they were forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves returning to the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand.

<div class="line_en">That did not seem far off. "It will not be long now," thought Bilbo, "before the goblins win the Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone through. I would rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and Kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the merry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have always understood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out of it."</div>

<div class="line_en">On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill among the Elves-partly because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the Elvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end.</div>
