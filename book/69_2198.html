<div class="line_en">Lyra clenched herself, but relaxed almost at once as Pantalaimon thought to her: We're only safe as long as we pretend. She opened her eyes and found that they'd been containing tears, and to her surprise and shame she sobbed and sobbed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra moaned and trembled uncontrollably, just as if she had been pulled out of water so cold that her heart had nearly frozen. Pantalaimon simply lay against her bare skin, inside her clothes, loving her back to herself, but aware all the time of Mrs. Coulter, busy preparing a drink of something, and most of all of the golden monkey, whose hard little fingers had run swiftly over Lyra's body when only Pantalaimon could have noticed; and who had felt, around her waist, the oilskin pouch with its contents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉无法控制地呻吟着、颤抖着，就像刚刚被从水里捞出来似的，那水是那么的冷，她的心几乎都要被冻僵了。潘特莱蒙钻到她的衣服里面，贴着她的肌肤躺着，为莱拉又恢复了完整而感到高兴。但是他知道，库尔特夫人一直在忙忙碌碌地准备某种饮料；他也知道，大部分时间里，那只金猴结实的小手指已经迅速地在莱拉身上摸了一遍，这也只有潘特莱蒙能注意到。这只猴子还摸了摸莱拉腰间那个油布袋子，看看里面装了什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cry as much as you need to, darling," said that soft voice, and Lyra determined to stop as soon as she possibly could. She struggled to hold back the tears, she pressed her lips together, she choked down the sobs that still shook her chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哭出来吧，亲爱的，”那个温柔的声音说道。刚能控制得住自己的时候，莱拉便决定不再哭了。她努力止住眼泪，紧抿着嘴唇，强压着啜泣，但胸膛还在一起一伏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pantalaimon played the same game: fool them, fool them. He became a mouse and crept away from Lyra's hand to sniff timidly at the drink in the monkey's clutch. It was innocuous: an infusion of chamomile, nothing more. He crept back to Lyra's shoulder and whispered, "Drink it."</div>

And now that she was doing something difficult and familiar and never quite predictable, namely lying, she felt a sort of mastery again, the same sense of complexity and control that the alethiometer gave her. She had to be careful not to say anything obviously impossible; she had to be vague in some places and invent plausible details in others; she had to be an artist, in short.</div>

She invented a voyage with the Gobblers to Trollesund, and then an escape, lavish with details from her observation of the town; and a time as maid-of-all-work at Einarsson's Bar, and then a spell working for a family of farmers inland, and then being caught by the Samoyeds and brought to Bolvangar.</div>

All that happens is a little cut, and then everything's peaceful. Forever! You see, your daemon's a wonderful friend and com panion when you're young, but at the age we call puberty, the age you're coming to very soon, darling, daemons bring all sort of troublesome thoughts and feelings, and that's what lets Dust in. A quick little operation before that, and you're never troubled again. And your daemon stays with you, only… just not connected. Like a… like a wonderful pet, if you like. The best pet in the world!
