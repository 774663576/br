<div class="line_en">And then, Phoebus was alive; she was sure of it, she had seen him. To her the fact of Phoebus being alive was everything. After the series of fatal shocks which had overturned everything within her, she had found but one thing intact in her soul, one sentiment,-- her love for the captain.

<div class="line_en">La Esmeralda did not think of the captain without bitterness, no doubt. No doubt it was terrible that he also should have been deceived; that he should have believed that impossible thing, that he could have conceived of a stab dealt by her who would have given a thousand lives for him. But, after all, she must not be too angry with him for it; had she not confessed her crime? had she not yielded, weak woman that she was, to torture? The fault was entirely hers. She should have allowed her finger nails to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her. In short, if she could but see Phoebus once more, for a single minute, only one word would be required, one look, in order to undeceive him, to bring him back. She did not doubt it. She was astonished also at many singular things, at the accident of Phoebus's presence on the day of the penance, at the young girl with whom he had been. She was his sister, no doubt. An unreasonable explanation, but she contented herself with it, because she needed to believe that Phoebus still loved her, and loved her alone. Had he not sworn it to her? What more was needed, simple and credulous as she was? And then, in this matter, were not appearances much more against her than against him? Accordingly, she waited. She hoped.</div>

<div class="line_en">Let us add that the church, that vast church, which surrounded her on every side, which guarded her, which saved her, was itself a sovereign tranquillizer. The solemn lines of that architecture, the religious attitude of all the objects which surrounded the young girl, the serene and pious thoughts which emanated, so to speak, from all the pores of that stone, acted upon her without her being aware of it. The edifice had also sounds fraught with such benediction and such majesty, that they soothed this ailing soul. The monotonous chanting of the celebrants, the responses of the people to the priest, sometimes inarticulate, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious trembling of the painted windows, the organ, bursting forth like a hundred trumpets, the three belfries, humming like hives of huge bees, that whole orchestra on which bounded a gigantic scale, ascending, descending incessantly from the voice of a throng to that of one bell, dulled her memory, her imagination, her grief. The bells, in particular, lulled her. It was something like a powerful magnetism which those vast instruments shed over her in great waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有，主教堂，这座宏大的教堂从四面八方包围着她，卫护着她，庇佑着她，它本身就是上天的抚慰。这座建筑物的庄严线条，姑娘周围一切事物的宗教色彩，宛如从这座巨石每一毛孔里渗透出来的庄重的虔诚情绪，这一切都在不知不觉作用于她。这座建筑似乎也发出庄严祝福的音响，慰藉着这病痛的灵魂。行法事者的单调歌声，信众给予教士的时而悄然无声、时而声若雷鸣的响应，彩色玻璃窗共鸣和谐的颤动，千百只小号轰鸣似的管风琴声，三座钟楼（16）钟声嗡嗡如同几窝巨大蜜蜂，——这整个一部交响曲以无比磅礴的音阶从人群到钟楼、又从钟楼到人群，不断上行下降，麻痹了她的记忆、想象和痛苦。尤其是钟乐使她安然忘忧。好像有强大的磁力，这些庞大乐器散发着音乐的洪流，席卷着她。【注：（16）正面两座（南、北）钟楼，加上背面（东）的尖塔。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the thought of Phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought of Quasimodo. He was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole communication which remained to her with men, with the living. Unfortunate girl! she was more outside the world than Quasimodo. She understood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given her. She often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which should close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to the poor bellringer. He was too ugly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃及姑娘在思念孚比斯之余，有时也想到卡席莫多。这是她现在与人、与活生生的人之间尚存的唯一联系、唯一交往、唯一交际。可怜的姑娘！她甚至比卡席莫多更与世隔绝！对于邂逅相遇的这位古怪朋友，她一点也不了解。她时常责备自己不能感激到视而不见的程度，她怎么样也不能对可怜敲钟人的丑相感到习惯。他太丑了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus every sunrise found her more calm, breathing better, less pale. In proportion as her inward wounds closed, her grace and beauty blossomed once more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful. Her former character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her love for singing, her modesty. She took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her through the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，随着每次旭日东升，她变得更为沉静，呼吸更为畅快，脸色也稍稍红润了。心灵的创伤逐渐愈合，优雅俏丽的容颜重新灿烂开放，都较前深沉而安详。过去的性格，甚至多少也像过去那样的欢快，还有惯常的那种把嘴一噘的娇态，对山羊的钟爱，唱歌的爱好，处女的娇羞，这一切也都恢复了。她小心翼翼，每天早晨穿衣服都躲在小室的角落里，生怕附近阁楼里会有什么住客从她这边的窗洞看见她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which he never entered) at the moment when la Esmeralda was singing an old Spanish ballad, the words of which she did not understand, but which had lingered in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child. At the sight of that villanous form which made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the young girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm. The unhappy bellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large, misshapen hands with a suppliant air. "Oh!" he said, sorrowfully, "continue, I implore you, and do not drive me away." She did not wish to pain him, and resumed her lay, trembling all over. By degrees, however, her terror disappeared, and she yielded herself wholly to the slow and melancholy air which she was singing. He remained on his knees with hands clasped, as in prayer, attentive, hardly breathing, his gaze riveted upon the gypsy's brilliant eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last, one morning, la Esmeralda had advanced to the edge of the roof, and was looking into the Place over the pointed roof of Saint-Jean le Rond. Quasimodo was standing behind her. He had placed himself in that position in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the displeasure of seeing him. All at once the gypsy started, a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the Place with anguish, exclaiming: "Phoebus! come! come! a word, a single word in the name of heaven! Phoebus! Phoebus!" Her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole person bore the heartrending expression of a shipwrecked man who is making a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing afar off in a ray of sunlight on the horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，一天早晨，爱斯美腊达走到挨近窗外屋顶的地方，越过圆形圣约翰教堂的屋顶眺望广场。卡席莫多也在，站在她后面不远。他是自愿选择这样的一个位置的，为的是尽量避免让姑娘看见而引起不愉快。突然，吉卜赛女郎一个寒噤，眼睛里闪出泪花，同时也流露出欣喜的目光。她跪倒在屋顶边缘，焦急地向广场伸出双臂，叫道：“孚比斯！来，来呀！看在老天的份上，说一句话，只说一句吧！孚比斯！孚比斯！”她的嗓音、面容、动作，整个的人，表现出令人心碎的神情，就好像一个沉船落水的人，向远方在地平线上阳光里驶过的欢乐的船舶，发出求救的信号。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Among the grotesque personages sculptured on the wall, there was one to whom he was particularly attached, and with which he often seemed to exchange fraternal glances. Once the gypsy heard him saying to it,— "Oh! why am not I of stone, like you!"</div>

She made him a sign that she was listening. Then he began to sigh, half opened his lips, appeared for a moment to be on the point of speaking, then he looked at her again, shook his head, and withdrew slowly, with his brow in his hand, leaving the gypsy stupefied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一次，他笨手笨脚，怯生生地来到她面前，好不容易才说出：“您听我说，我有话跟您说。”她表示她听着哩。他却叹了口气，嘴唇微微张开，一时好像就要把话说出来了，却摇摇头，一手捂住脸，缓缓退去，搞得埃及姑娘莫名其妙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Quasimodo leaned over the Place, and saw that the object of this tender and agonizing prayer was a young man, a captain, a handsome cavalier all glittering with arms and decorations, prancing across the end of the Place, and saluting with his plume a beautiful lady who was smiling at him from her balcony.

Quasimodo, motionless and attentive, beheld a throng of lively, dancing shadows pass athwart the many-colored painted panes.

<div class="line_en">The young man and the young girl, so far as our deaf man could judge, without hearing a single one of their words, appeared to abandon themselves to a very tender tête-a-tête. The young girl seemed to have allowed the officer to make a girdle for her of his arm, and gently repulsed a kiss.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not without difficulty that Quasimodo succeeded in recognizing in the man the handsome captain, in the woman the young lady whom he had seen welcome the officer in the morning from that very balcony. The place was perfectly dark, and a double crimson curtain which had fallen across the door the very moment it closed again, allowed no light to reach the balcony from the apartment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡席莫多在黑暗中好不容易才认出：男的就是英俊的卫队长，女的是上午他看见从这座阳台上欢迎军官的那位小姐。广场上一片漆黑，门关上以后，里面的深红色双层帷幔立刻遮上了，所以，阳台上几乎一点光线也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quasimodo looked on from below at this scene which was all the more pleasing to witness because it was not meant to be seen. He contemplated with bitterness that beauty, that happiness. After all, nature was not dumb in the poor fellow, and his human sensibility, all maliciously contorted as it was, quivered no less than any other. He thought of the miserable portion which Providence had allotted to him; that woman and the pleasure of love, would pass forever before his eyes, and that he should never do anything but behold the felicity of others. But that which rent his heart most in this sight, that which mingled indignation with his anger, was the thought of what the gypsy would suffer could she behold it. It is true that the night was very dark, that la Esmeralda, if she had remained at her post (and he had no doubt of this), was very far away, and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish the lovers on the balcony. This consoled him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场景本不是给别人看的，所以更加优美动人，而卡席莫多正好从下面旁观着。他观看着这幸福的美妙场面，心中好不辛酸。这可怜家伙的天性毕竟没有喑哑，他的脊椎骨虽然恶劣地扭曲歪斜，仍然像别人一样能有感受而战栗。他想到上天给他安排的恶劣命运，女人、爱情、肉体欢娱，永远从他眼底飘浮而过，他自己只能眼睁睁看着别人享受幸福。然而，这一场面中最使他痛心，痛苦中掺和着愤慨的，是想到如果埃及姑娘看见了该会多么心碎。确实，夜是沉黑沉黑的，而爱斯美腊达即使还留在原来的位置上（对于这他是深信不疑的），距离这里也远得很，况且他自己分辨出阳台上这对情侣都极为费劲。这样，他心里稍稍松快了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This word did, indeed, produce a great effect on Phoebus, but not of the kind which the deaf man expected. It will be remembered that our gallant officer had retired with Fleur-de-Lys several moments before Quasimodo had rescued the condemned girl from the hands of Charmolue. Afterwards, in all his visits to the Gondelaurier mansion he had taken care not to mention that woman, the memory of whom was, after all, painful to him; and on her side, Fleur-de-Lys had not deemed it politic to tell him that the gypsy was alive. Hence Phoebus believed poor "Similar" to be dead, and that a month or two had elapsed since her death. Let us add that for the last few moments the captain had been reflecting on the profound darkness of the night, the supernatural ugliness, the sepulchral voice of the strange messenger; that it was past midnight; that the street was deserted, as on the evening when the surly monk had accosted him; and that his horse snorted as it looked at Quasimodo.</div>
