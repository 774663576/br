<div class="line_en">Nimble Dick said the coast road was the shortest way, and the easiest, so they were seldom out of sight of the bay. The towns and villages along the shore grew smaller as they went, and less frequent. At nightfall they would seek an inn. Crabb would share the common bed with other travelers, whilst Brienne took a room for her and Podrick. "Cheaper if we all shared the same bed, m'lady," Nimble Dick would say. "You could lay your sword between us. Old Dick's a harmless fellow. Chivalrous as a knight, and honest as the day is long."</div>

<div class="line_en">She shut the door between them and stood there listening until she was certain he had moved away. However nimble he might be, Dick Crabb was no Jaime Lannister, no Mad Mouse, not even a Humfrey Wagstaff. He was scrawny and ill fed, his only armor a dinted halfhelm spotted with rust. In place of a sword, he carried an old, nicked dagger. So long as she was awake, he posed no danger to her. "Podrick," she said, "there will come a time when there are no more inns to shelter us. I do not trust our guide. When we make camp, can you watch over me as I sleep?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她“砰”的一声关上门，然后站在原地倾听，直到确信他已走开。不管狄克·克莱勃有多机灵，他毕竟不是詹姆·兰尼斯特，不是疯鼠，甚至不是亨佛利·瓦格斯塔夫。他瘦骨嶙岣，食不果腹，唯一的防具是一顶锈迹斑斑、布满凹痕的半盔。他没剑，只有一把带豁口的旧匕首——所以，只要她保持清醒，他便构不成威胁。“波德瑞克，”她说，“将来没有客栈给我们住，而我不信任我们的向导。所以每次野营之后，当我睡觉时，你能不能留心看着点？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," she said sternly. "You are not to try and fight him. All I ask is that you watch him as I sleep, and wake me if he does anything suspicious. I wake quickly, you will find."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”她坚决地说，“你不要跟他打。我只要你在我睡觉时监视他，假如他有任何可疑行为，立即弄醒我。放心，我醒得很快的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Crabb showed his true colors the next day, when they stopped to water the horses. Brienne had to step behind some bushes to empty her bladder. As she was squatting, she heard Podrick say, "What are you doing? You get away from there." She finished her business, hiked up her breeches, and returned to the road to find Nimble Dick wiping flour off his fingers. "You won't find any dragons in my saddlebags," she told him. "I keep my gold upon my person." Some of it was in the pouch at her belt, the rest hidden in a pair of pockets sewn inside her clothing. The fat purse inside her saddlebag was filled with coppers large and small, pennies and halfpennies, groats and stars… and fine white flour, to make it fatter still. She had bought the flour from the cook at the Seven Swords the morning she rode out from Duskendale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果第二天停下饮马时，克莱勃就露出了本色。布蕾妮走到灌木丛后面去方便，她蹲在那里，听到波德瑞克说，“你干吗？离远点儿。”完事之后，她拉起裤子，回到路上，发现机灵狄克正在擦去手指上的面粉。“鞍囊里没有金龙，”她告诉他，“我把金币放身上了。”一部分金币放在她腰带上系的钱袋里，其余的藏在衣服内侧缝的两只口袋中。鞍囊上鼓鼓的大钱包塞满了大大小小不同面值的铜币和铜板，铜星币与铜麦币…还有让包袱显得更加鼓鼓囊囊的白面粉，那是自暮谷城出发前的早晨，她特意问七剑客栈的厨子买的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“狄克没恶意，小姐。”他晃晃沾着面粉的手指，以示无辜。“我只想确认你到底有没有答应我的金龙。这世上骗子多，正派人容易上当。不过还好，你不是骗子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dick would oft sing as they rode along together; never a whole song, only a snatch of this and a verse of that. She suspected that he meant to charm her, to put her off her guard. Sometimes he would try to get her and Podrick to sing along with him, to no avail. The boy was too shy and tongue-tied, and Brienne did not sing. Did you sing for your father? Lady Stark had asked her once, at Riverrun. Did you sing for Renly? She had not, not ever, though she had wanted… she had wanted…</div>

<div class="line_en">When he was not singing, Nimble Dick would talk, regaling them with tales of Crackclaw Point. Every gloomy valley had its lord, he said, the lot of them united only by their mistrust of outsiders. In their veins the blood of the First Men ran dark and strong. "The Andals tried t' take Crackclaw, but we bled them in the valleys and drowned them in the bogs. Only what their sons couldn't win with swords, their pretty daughters won with kisses. They married into the houses they couldn't conquer, aye."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Darklyn kings of Duskendale had tried to impose their rule on Crackclaw Point; the Mootons of Maidenpool had tried as well, and later the haughty Celtigars of Crab Isle. But the Crackclaws knew their bogs and forests as no outsider could, and if hard pressed would vanish into the caverns that honeycombed their hills. When not fighting would-be conquerors, they fought each other. Their blood feuds were as deep and dark as the bogs between their hills. From time to time some champion would bring peace to the Point, but it never lasted longer than his lifetime. Lord Lucifer Hardy, he was a great one, and the Brothers Brune as well. Old Crackbones even more so, but the Crabbs were the mightiest of all. Dick still refused to believe that Brienne had never heard of Ser Clarence Crabb and his exploits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暮谷城达克林家族的国王们曾试图将领地延伸至蟹爪半岛，女泉城的慕顿家族，包括后来蟹岛的赛提加家族也尝试过。然而蟹爪半岛的居民熟悉本地的沼泽与森林，外人无法比拟，如果形势危急，他们还能消失在丘陵中蜂窝般的山洞里。不跟外敌作战时，大家就窝里斗，家族血仇如同山间的沼泽一般又黑又深。有时某位英雄会为蟹爪半岛带来暂时的和平，但等他死去，一切又恢复原状。路西法·哈迪伯爵是伟大的领主，布伦兄弟也一样，老克莱克波恩比他们更胜一筹，但克莱勃是最强大的。狄克仍然不肯相信布蕾妮从没听说过克莱伦斯·克莱勃爵士的英雄事迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

No common sword could check her, nor any shield withstand her kiss. Ser Galladon bore the Just Maid proudly, but only thrice did he unsheathe her. He would not use the Maid against a mortal man, for she was so potent as to make any fight unfair."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He was dead. M'lady must know that." Crabb gave her a sideways look. "Aegon sent his sister up to Crackclaw, that Visenya. The lords had heard o' Harren's end. Being no fools, they laid their swords at her feet. The queen took them as her own men, and said they'd owe no fealty to Maidenpool, Crab Isle, or Duskendale. Don't stop them bloody Celtigars from sending men to t' eastern shore to collect his taxes. If he sends enough, a few come back to him… elsewise, we bow only to our own lords, and the king. The true king, not Robert and his ilk." He spat. "There was Crabbs and Brunes and Boggses with Prince Rhaegar on the Trident, and in the Kingsguard too. A Hardy, a Cave, a Pyne, and three Crabbs, Clement and Rupert and Clarence the Short. Six foot tall, he was, but short compared to the real Ser Clarence. We're all good dragon men, up Crackclaw way."</div>

<div class="line_en">Brienne curled up beneath her cloak, with Podrick yawning at her side. I was not always wary, she might have shouted down at Crabb. When I was a little girl I believed that all men were as noble as my father. Even the men who told her what a pretty girl she was, how tall and bright and clever, how graceful when she danced. It was Septa Roelle who had lifted the scales from her eyes. "They only say those things to win your lord father's favor," the woman had said. "You'll find truth in your looking glass, not on the tongues of men." It was a harsh lesson, one that left her weeping, but it had stood her in good stead at Harrenhal when Ser Hyle and his friends had played their game. A maid has to be mistrustful in this world, or she will not be a maid for long, she was thinking, as the rain began to fall.</div>

Nor were there any trees to give them shelter. They were forced to camp amongst some rocks, fifty yards above the tideline. The rocks at least would keep the wind off. "Best we keep a watch tonight, m'lady," Crabb told her, as she was struggling to get a driftwood fire lit. "A place like this, there might be squishers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨水冲刷仿佛是天地间唯一的声响。机灵狄克一个劲儿只顾着向前跋涉。于是她多了个心眼，发现他总是弓着背，仿佛低伏在马鞍上就能保持干燥。这回，黑暗降临时，附近没有村落，也没有可以提供遮蔽的树林。他们被迫在潮线上方五十码处的岩石群中露宿。至少岩石可以挡风。“今晚最好有人守夜，小姐，”她正努力点燃一堆浮木，克莱勃告诉她，“像这样的地方也许会有吧唧脚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It rained all that day. The narrow track they followed soon turned to mud beneath them. What trees they saw were naked, and the steady rain had turned their fallen leaves into a sodden brown mat. Despite its squirrel-skin lining, Dick's cloak soaked through, and she could see him shivering. Brienne felt a moment's pity for the man. He has not eaten well, that's plain. She wondered if there truly was a smugglers' cove, or a ruined castle called the Whispers. Hungry men do desperate things. This all might be some ploy to cozen her. Suspicion soured her stomach.</div>

Fish-belly white they are, with webs between their fingers. They're always damp and fishy-smelling, but behind these blubbery lips they got rows of green teeth sharp as needles. Some say the First Men killed them all, but don't you believe it. They come by night and steal bad little children, padding along on them webbed feet with a little squish-squish sound. The girls they keep to breed with, but the boys they eat, tearing at them with those sharp green teeth." He grinned at Podrick. "They'd eat you, boy. They'd eat you raw."</div>

Disgusted, she settled down with her back to a rock, pulled her cloak over herself, and resigned herself to a cold, wet night. Dreaming of a hot meal, she gnawed on a strip of hard salt beef whilst Nimble Dick talked about the time Ser Clarence Crabb had fought the squisher king.

Brienne sat with her back to the rock, listening to the waves. Are you near the sea, Sansa? she wondered. Are you waiting at the Whispers for a ship that will never come? Who do you have with you?

Twice she dozed. The second time she woke all at once, heart pounding, convinced that someone was looming over her. Her limbs were stiff, and her cloak had gotten tangled round her ankles.

<div class="line_en">The way up proved to be a steep stony path hidden within a cleft in the rock. Most of it was natural, but here and there steps had been carved to ease the climb. Sheer walls of rock, eaten away by centuries of wind and spray, hemmed them in to either side. In some places they had assumed fantastic shapes. Nimble Dick pointed out a few as they climbed. "There's an ogre's head, see?" he said, and Brienne smiled when she saw it. "And that there's a stone dragon. T'other wing fell off when my father was a boy.

Brienne thought it might have been a woman, and said as much to Nimble Dick. He agreed. "Brune's too old to go climbing wallwalks, and his sons and grandsons went off to the wars.

She was weary, though, she could not deny that. Her thighs were hard as iron from the saddle, and of late she had been sleeping only four hours a night, whilst Podrick watched over her. If Nimble Dick meant to try and murder them, she was convinced it would happen here, on ground that he knew well. He could be taking them to some robbers' den where he had kin as treacherous as he was. Or perhaps he was just leading them in circles, waiting for that rider to catch up.

They rode through pines and bogs, under dark skies and intermittent rain, past sinkholes and caves and the ruins of ancient strongholds whose stones were blanketed in moss.

<div class="line_en">It may be that I will need to kill him, she told herself one night as she paced about the camp. The notion made her queasy. Her old master-at-arms had always questioned whether she was hard enough for battle. "You have a man's strength in your arms," Ser Goodwin had said to her, more than once, "but your heart is as soft as any maid's. It is one thing to train in the yard with a blunted sword in hand, and another to drive a foot of sharpened steel into a man's gut and see the light go out of his eyes." To toughen her, Ser Goodwin used to send her to her father's butcher to slaughter lambs and suckling pigs. The piglets squealed and the lambs screamed like frightened children. By the time the butchering was done Brienne had been blind with tears, her clothes so bloody that she had given them to her maid to burn. But Ser Goodwin still had doubts. "A piglet is a piglet. It is different with a man. When I was a squire young as you, I had a friend who was strong and quick and agile, a champion in the yard. We all knew that one day he would be a splendid knight. Then war came to the Stepstones. I saw my friend drive his foeman to his knees and knock the axe from his hand, but when he might have finished he held back for half a heartbeat. In battle half a heartbeat is a lifetime. The man slipped out his dirk and found a chink in my friend's armor. His strength, his speed, his valor, all his hard-won skill… it was worth less than a mummer's fart, because he flinched from killing. Remember that, girl."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="某天晚上在露营地附近踱步时，她忽然想，也许我不得不回头干掉追兵。这想法让她很不安。难怪，她以前的教头便常常质疑她的意志。“你有男人的力量，”古德温爵士不止一次告诫她，“但还是一副女人心肠。在院子里手持钝剑训练是一回事，将一尺长剑刺入他人腹中，并看着对方眼中的光芒渐渐消失，那又是另一回事。”为了让她更坚强，古德温爵士派她去父亲的屠宰场，宰杀羊羔和乳猪。嘶鸣的乳猪和尖叫的羊羔很像被吓坏了的小孩子，等屠宰完毕，布蕾妮已是泪眼朦胧，沾满鲜血的衣服只好交给女仆拿去烧掉。然而古德温爵士还不满意，“猪崽毕竟是猪崽，跟人不同。我当侍从时和你一样年轻，当年我有个朋友又强壮、又快速、又敏捷，是训练场上的英雄。我们都认为，有朝一日，他定能成为杰出的骑士。然后战争打到石阶列岛，我亲眼看着我这位朋友将对手逼得跪倒在地，并打掉了对手手中的斧子，但当他要结果那人时，迟疑了片刻。在战场上，片刻就等于一生。只见那人拔出匕首，插进我朋友盔甲间的缝隙中。他的力量、他的速度、他的英勇，所有艰苦训练得来的技艺…不如戏子放的屁。一切的一切，全因为他正该痛下杀手时畏缩了。千万记住这点，小妹妹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The castle was built of old, unmortared stones, no two the same. Moss grew thick in clefts between the rocks, and trees were growing up from the foundations. Most old castles had a godswood. By the look of it, the Whispers had little else. Brienne walked her mare to the cliff's edge, where the curtain wall had collapsed. Mounds of poisonous red ivy grew over the heap of broken stones. She tied the horse to a tree and edged as close to the precipice as she dared. Fifty feet below, the waves were swirling in and over the remnants of a shattered tower. Behind it, she glimpsed the mouth of a large cavern.</div>

The forest had breached the walls, and swallowed keep and bailey. But there was a portcullis behind the gate, its teeth sunk deep into the soft muddy ground. The iron was red with rust, but it held when Brienne rattled it. "No one's used this gate for a long time."</div>

In place of a jester's flail he had a triple morningstar, three spiked balls chained to a wooden haft. He swung it hard and low, and one of Crabb's knees exploded in a spray of blood and bone. "That's funny," Shagwell crowed as Dick fell. The sword she'd given him went flying from his hand and vanished in the weeds. He writhed on the ground, screaming and clutching at the ruins of his knee. "Oh, look," said Shagwell, "it's Smuggler Dick, the one who made the map for us.
