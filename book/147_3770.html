<div class="line_en">A destiny that leads the English to the Dutch is strange enough; but one that leads from Epsom into Pennsylvania, and thence into the hills that shut in Altamont over the proud coral cry of the cock, and the soft stone smile of an angel, is touched by that dark miracle of chance which makes new magic in a dusty world.</div>

<div class="line_en">An Englishman named Gilbert Gaunt, which he later changed to Gant (a concession probably to Yankee phonetics), having come to Baltimore from Bristol in 1837 on a sailing vessel, soon let the profits of a public house which he had purchased roll down his improvident gullet. He wandered westward into Pennsylvania, eking out a dangerous living by matching fighting cocks against the champions of country barnyards, and often escaping after a night spent in a village jail, with his champion dead on the field of battle, without the clink of a coin in his pocket, and sometimes with the print of a farmer's big knuckles on his reckless face. But he always escaped, and coming at length among the Dutch at harvest time he was so touched by the plenty of their land that he cast out his anchors there. Within a year he married a rugged young widow with a tidy farm who like all the other Dutch had been charmed by his air of travel, and his grandiose speech, particularly when he did Hamlet in the manner of the great Edmund Kean. Every one said he should have been an actor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Englishman begot children -- a daughter and four sons -- lived easily and carelessly, and bore patiently the weight of his wife's harsh but honest tongue. The years passed, his bright somewhat staring eyes grew dull and bagged, the tall Englishman walked with a gouty shuffle: one morning when she came to nag him out of sleep she found him dead of an apoplexy. He left five children, a mortgage and -- in his strange dark eyes which now stared bright and open -- something that had not died: a passionate and obscure hunger for voyages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，这个英国人就有了孩子——一个女儿，四个儿子。平时除了要耐心忍受妻子那粗鲁却直率的责骂以外，他的生活过得还算轻松自在。一晃好几年过去了，他原本欢快明亮的眼睛逐渐失去了光泽，眼皮也耷拉了下来。这位身材高大的英国人由于身患痛风，走起路来开始蹒跚摇晃了。一天早晨，他妻子不断唠叨着来到他的床边，想叫他起床，但却发现他已经一命呜呼了，他死于中风。他只留下五个孩子、一张房产抵押。他那双原本暗淡奇怪的眼睛，此刻却睁得大大的，看起来非常明亮——眼神中有某种东西并没有死去：这是一种永不消失、想要周游各地的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, with this legacy, we leave this Englishman and are concerned hereafter with the heir to whom he bequeathed it, his second son, a boy named Oliver. How this boy stood by the roadside near his mother's farm, and saw the dusty Rebels march past on their way to Gettysburg, how his cold eyes darkened when he heard the great name of Virginia, and how the year the war had ended, when he was still fifteen, he had walked along a street in Baltimore, and seen within a little shop smooth granite slabs of death, carved lambs and cherubim, and an angel poised upon cold phthisic feet, with a smile of soft stone idiocy -- this is a longer tale. But I know that his cold and shallow eyes had darkened with the obscure and passionate hunger that had lived in a dead man's eyes, and that had led from Fenchurch Street past Philadelphia. As the boy looked at the big angel with the carved stipe of lilystalk, a cold and nameless excitement possessed him. The long fingers of his big hands closed. He felt that he wanted, more than anything in the world, to carve delicately with a chisel. He wanted to wreak something dark and unspeakable in him into cold stone. He wanted to carve an angel's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在让我们暂且把这个英国人放在一边，来看看他的后代——二儿子奥利弗吧。说来话长。这个小子曾站在母亲的田地路旁，看着南方的叛军一路尘土飞扬，朝葛底斯堡的方向进发；他一听到弗吉尼亚这个伟大的名字，冷静的双眼一下子黯然而神秘起来。那年南北战争宣布正式结束，当时他只有15岁。他走在巴尔的摩的大街上，看到一家小店里有许多纪念死者的花岗岩石碑，上面镶刻着小绵羊和长翅膀的天使。其中一个天使长着瘦小冰凉的脚，脸上露出温和、凝滞的微笑。在某种模糊、强烈的渴望中，我知道这种冷漠而天真的眼神会忽然变暗变深，其中蕴藏着死人生前眼中燃烧的朦胧的渴望。正是这种渴望把他从弗雷彻大街带到了费城。孩子双眼盯着手捧石雕百合花的天使时，内心涌起一种冷漠而莫名的激动。他将那双大手的手指紧紧合在一起。此刻他只想拥有一把凿子，用它可以雕刻出一件精美的东西来。他想把自己内心深处某种神秘而无法言说的东西用雕刻传达出来。他想雕刻一个天使的头像来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He never found it. He never learned to carve an angel's head. The dove, the lamb, the smooth joined marble hands of death, and letters fair and fine -- but not the angel. And of all the years of waste and loss -- the riotous years in Baltimore, of work and savage drunkenness, and the theatre of Booth and Salvini, which had a disastrous effect upon the stone cutter, who memorized each accent of the noble rant, and strode muttering through the streets, with rapid gestures of the enormous talking hands -- these are blind steps and gropings of our exile, the painting of our hunger as, remembering speechlessly, we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone, a leaf, a door.

<div class="line_en">He set up business in Sydney, the little capital city of one of the middle Southern states, lived soberly and industriously under the attentive eye of a folk still raw with defeat and hostility, and finally, his good name founded and admission won, he married a gaunt tubercular spinstress, ten years his elder, but with a nest egg and an unshakable will to matrimony. Within eighteen months he was a howling maniac again, his little business went smash while his foot stayed on the polished rail, and Cynthia, his wife -- whose life, the natives said, he had not helped to prolong -- died suddenly one night after a hemorrhage.</div>

As he stared mournfully out the window at the great raw land so sparsely tilled by the futile and occasional little farms, which seemed to have made only little grubbing patches in the wilderness, his heart went cold and leaden in him. He thought of the great barns of Pennsylvania, the ripe bending of golden grain, the plenty, the order, the clean thrift of the people. And he thought of how he had set out to get order and position for himself, and of the rioting confusion of his life, the blot and blur of years, and the red waste of his youth.</div>

<div class="line_en">The grisly parade of the spectre years trooped through his brain. Suddenly, he saw that his life had been channelled by a series of accidents: a mad Rebel singing of Armageddon, the sound of a bugle on the road, the mule-hoofs of the army, the silly white face of an angel in a dusty shop, a slut's pert wiggle of her hams as she passed by. He had reeled out of warmth and plenty into this barren land: as he stared out the window and saw the fallow unworked earth, the great raw lift of the Piedmont, the muddy red clay roads, and the slattern people gaping at the stations -- a lean farmer gangling above his reins, a dawdling negro, a gap-toothed yokel, a hard sallow woman with a grimy baby -- the strangeness of destiny stabbed him with fear.

<div class="line_cn" title="过去那些恐怖的岁月犹如鬼影一般在脑际闪过。忽然间，他发现，自己的人生由一连串偶然的事件构成：一个叛军狂热地高唱战歌，公路上传来尖厉的号角声，军队行进时传来的马蹄声，粉尘飞扬的石匠铺里傻笑的天使，浪荡女人从身边走过时屁股扭动的样子。他不明白自己为什么会舍弃那些温暖、美满的生活，跑到这个贫瘠的不毛之地来。他凝神眺望窗外，望着那片荒芜、光秃秃、未开垦的土地，望着高耸的彼得蒙特高原，望着泥泞的红土路，望着朝车站张望的那些脏兮兮、傻乎乎、喘着粗气的人们——一位拉着牲口、笨拙缓行、瘦弱的农夫，一位懒散的黑人，一位缺了门牙的乡巴佬，一位脸色蜡黄、怀抱脏兮兮孩子的女人——这时他觉得命运真是不可捉摸，内心忽然涌起一丝惶恐。他怎么会从昔日清洁勤俭的荷兰人身边跑到这个空旷、寸草不生、令人失落的破地方呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dusk came. The huge bulk of the hills was foggily emergent. Small smoky lights went up in the hillside shacks. The train crawled dizzily across high trestles spanning ghostly hawsers of water. Far up, far down, plumed with wisps of smoke, toy cabins stuck to bank and gulch and hillside. The train toiled sinuously up among gouged red cuts with slow labor. As darkness came, Oliver descended at the little town of Old Stockade where the rails ended. The last great wall of the hills lay stark above him. As he left the dreary little station and stared into the greasy lamplight of a country store, Oliver felt that he was crawling, like a great beast, into the circle of those enormous hills to die.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning he resumed his journey by coach. His destination was the little town of Altamont, twenty-four miles away beyond the rim of the great outer wall of the hills. As the horses strained slowly up the mountain road Oliver's spirit lifted a little. It was a gray-golden day in late October, bright and windy. There was a sharp bite and sparkle in the mountain air: the range soared above him, close, immense, clean, and barren. The trees rose gaunt and stark: they were almost leafless. The sky was full of windy white rags of cloud; a thick blade of mist washed slowly around the rampart of a mountain.</div>

<div class="line_en">This town of Altamont had been settled soon after the Revolutionary War. It had been a convenient stopping-off place for cattledrovers and farmers in their swing eastward from Tennessee into South Carolina. And, for several decades before the Civil War, it had enjoyed the summer patronage of fashionable people from Charleston and the plantations of the hot South. When Oliver first came to it it had begun to get some reputation not only as a summer resort, but as a sanitarium for tuberculars. Several rich men from the North had established hunting lodges in the hills, and one of them had bought huge areas of mountain land and, with an army of imported architects, carpenters and masons, was planning the greatest country estate in America -- something in limestone, with pitched slate roofs, and one hundred and eighty-three rooms. It was modelled on the chateau at Blois. There was also a vast new hotel, a sumptuous wooden barn, rambling comfortably upon the summit of a commanding hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔特蒙这个小镇是在革命战争结束不久后建立起来的。原来它曾是那些从田纳西州来到南卡罗来纳州去的赶牛人和农夫们便利的歇脚之地。内战以前的几十年里，那些来自查尔斯顿和炎热南方种植园的富有、时尚人士常会来这里度夏。奥利弗刚到这里的时候，这里不仅是避暑胜地，而且已经成了肺病疗养的好去处了。一些来自北方的富翁在山里盖起了狩猎山庄。其中有一位买下了一大片山地，请来了许多建筑师、木匠和泥瓦匠，正准备盖一幢全美最大的乡间别墅——用石灰石、大石板等材料做屋顶，总共183间屋子，完全按照法国勃鲁瓦城堡的风格建造。此外还有一家大饭店，一座豪华的木制谷仓，悠闲而舒适地矗立在主峰之巅，颇有气派。">查看中文翻译</div>

During the winter he rented a little shack at one edge of the town's public square, acquired a small stock of marbles, and set up business. But he had little to do at first save to think of the prospect of his death. During the bitter and lonely winter, while he thought he was dying, the gaunt scarecrow Yankee that flapped muttering through the streets became an object of familiar gossip to the townspeople. All the people at his boarding-house knew that at night he walked his room with great caged strides, and that a long low moan that seemed wrung from his bowels quivered incessantly on his thin lips.

Most of the time we think we're sick it's all in the mind. I remember three years ago I was teaching school in Hominy Township when I was taken down with pneumonia. Nobody ever expected to see me come out of it alive but I got through it somehow; I well remember one day I was sitting down -- as the fellow says, I reckon I was convalescin'; the reason I remember is Old Doctor Fletcher had just been and when he went out I saw him shake his head at my cousin Sally. 'Why Eliza, what on earth,' she said, just as soon as he had gone, 'he tells me you're spitting up blood every time you cough; you've got consumption as sure as you live.' 'Pshaw,' I said. I remember I laughed just as big as you please, determined to make a big joke of it all; I just thought to myself, I'm not going to give into it, I'll fool them all yet; 'I don't believe a word of it' (I said)," she nodded her head smartly at him, and pursed her lips, "'and besides, Sally' (I said) 'we've all got to go some time, and there's no use worrying about what's going to happen.

<div class="line_cn" title="排行最长的四个孩子，亨利、威尔、吉姆和伊丽莎，都是内战结束后的几年里长大的。当时的生活又穷又苦，所以现在他们都不愿意再提起那段日子。但是艰辛的生活经历已经深深地印在他们的心底，留下的创痕至今难以抚平。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Major Pentland rose slowly from his rocker by the fire, folded a large knife, and put the apple he had been peeling on the mantel. Bacchus looked up benevolently from a whittled stick, and Will, glancing up from his stubby nails which he was paring as usual, greeted the visitor with a birdlike nod and wink. The men amused themselves constantly with pocket knives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彭特兰上校从火炉边的摇椅上缓缓站起来，合上手中的一把大刀子，又把正削着的苹果放在炉台上。巴克斯叔叔正在用刀削一根木棍，这时也抬起头来慈爱地望了望他。正一如既往修剪着粗指甲的威尔，也停了下来，像个鸟儿似的冲来客点了点头，眨了眨眼。这家的男人们都喜欢摆弄随身带的刀子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And as they sat there in the hot little room with its warm odor of mellowing apples, the vast winds howled down from the hills, there was a roaring in the pines, remote and demented, the bare boughs clashed. And as they peeled, or pared, or whittled, their talk slid from its rude jocularity to death and burial: they drawled monotonously, with evil hunger, their gossip of destiny, and of men but newly lain in the earth. And as their talk wore on, and Gant heard the spectre moan of the wind, he was entombed in loss and darkness, and his soul plunged downward in the pit of night, for he saw that he must die a stranger -- that all, all but these triumphant Pentlands, who banqueted on death -- must die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一家人全都围坐在热乎乎的小屋里，空气中散发着苹果的清香。屋外，大风从山上呼啸而过，远处的松树不停地狂吼着，听起来遥远且疯狂，干枯的树枝不停地发出撞击声。他们坐在那里，不停地削着、剥着、刮着手上的东西，这期间，他们的话题则从粗俗的笑话转到死亡和丧葬上来：他们絮絮叨叨地谈论着人生的命运，谈论着新近的葬事，似乎对这个话题非常着迷。正当他们没完没了谈话的时候，甘特听着门外山风的鬼哭神嚎，觉得自己陷入了失落和黑暗的坟墓，他的灵魂在黑夜深处不能自拔。因为他明白，自己注定要客死异乡了，所有人都会如此。但是这些彭特兰家族的人却除外，因为他们正得意扬扬、津津有味地谈论着别人的死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, amid their laughter, the door opened, and several of the others came in-Eliza's mother, a plain worn Scotchwoman, and Jim, a ruddy porcine young fellow, his father's beardless twin, and Thaddeus, mild, ruddy, brown of hair and eye, bovine, and finally Greeley, the youngest, a boy with lapping idiot grins, full of strange squealing noises at which they laughed. He was eleven, degenerate, weak, scrofulous, but his white moist hands could draw from a violin music that had in it something unearthly and untaught.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，在哄笑声中，门开了。从外面又走进来几个人，他们是：伊丽莎的母亲，一位神情憔悴、普通的苏格兰女人；吉姆，一位面色红润、神情矮胖的年轻人，他长得跟其父几乎一模一样，只是缺少那撇胡子；还有撒迪厄斯，一位性情温顺、棕色头发、棕色眼睛，跟牛一样健壮的小伙；还有排行最小的格里利，一位只知道傻笑的男孩，他老是发出一些稀奇古怪的啸叫声，惹得众人大笑不已。这个孩子今年11岁，大脑先天发育不足，身体虚弱，患有淋巴性疾病。但是他那双皮肤白净、经常湿漉漉的小手却能拉几下小提琴，他无师自通，气度不凡。">查看中文翻译</div>
