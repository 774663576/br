<div class="line_en">"Come on, then! Come on!" shouts Peeta, panting with rage. But something has happened to the monkeys. They are withdrawing, backing up trees, fading into the jungle, as if some unheard voice calls them away. A Gamemaker's voice, telling them this is enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta gently lifts up the morphling and carries her the last few yards to the beach while Finnick and I keep our weapons at the ready. But except for the orange carcasses on the ground, the monkeys are gone. Peeta lays the morphling on the sand. I cut away the material over her chest, revealing the four deep puncture wounds. Blood slowly trickles from them, making them look far less deadly than they are. The real damage is inside. By the position of the openings, I feel certain the beast ruptured something vital, a lung, maybe even her heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll watch the trees," Finnick says before walking away. I'd like to walk away, too, but she grips my hand so tightly I would have to pry off her fingers, and I don't have the strength for that kind of cruelty. I think of Rue, how maybe I could sing a song or something. But I don't even know the morphling's name, let alone if she likes songs. I just know she's dying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我去林子那边看看。”芬尼克说着，大步走开了。我也想走开，但她牢牢抓住我的手，只有撬才能撬得开，可我又不忍。我想起了露露，我兴许能给她唱个歌什么的。可我连她的名字都不知道，更别说知道她喜欢什么歌了。我只知道她就要死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta crouches down on the other side of her and strokes her hair. When he begins to speak in a soft voice, it seems almost nonsensical, but the words aren't for me. "With my paint box at home, I can make every color imaginable. Pink. As pale as a baby's skin. Or as deep as rhubarb. Green like spring grass. Blue that shimmers like ice on water."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔俯身待在她身体的另一侧，抚弄着她头发。他在她的耳边轻声耳语，说着些我听不懂的话：“用我家颜料盒里的颜料，我可以配出各种各样的色彩，粉色，如婴儿的皮肤般的嫩粉，或如大黄茎花朵般的深粉；绿色，如春天的绿草般的翠绿；蓝色，如晶莹的冰凌般的淡蓝。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She lies on the sand, gasping like a fish out of water. Sagging skin, sickly green, her ribs as prominent as a child's dead of starvation. Surely she could afford food, but turned to the morphling just as Haymitch turned to drink, I guess. Everything about her speaks of waste -- her body, her life, the vacant look in her eyes. I hold one of her twitching hands, unclear whether it moves from the poison that affected our nerves, the shock of the attack, or withdrawal from the drug that was her sustenance. There is nothing we can do. Nothing but stay with her while she dies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她躺在沙滩上，像陆地上的鱼一样张开口费力地喘着气。她干瘪的皮肤是青灰色的，突出的肋骨像极度饥饿的孩子。她当然有饭吃，但我想她吗啡上瘾就像黑密斯对酒精的依赖。她的一切都表明她生活非常颓废，她的身体、她的生活、她空虚的眼神。我抓住她的一只手，这只手在不断抽搐，不知是由于受到毒雾的侵袭、还是遭受攻击后的恐惧、还是吗啡停止后的毒瘾发作。我们束手无策，只能守在她身边，眼看着她死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

Peeta's found a good vein and the water begins to gush from the spile. We slake our thirst, let the warm water pour over our itching bodies. We fill a handful of shells with drinking water and go back to the beach.</div>

Only that I can never settle the balance owed between us. All I can do at the moment is go to sleep and let him grieve in peace. And so I do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finnick sits on the sand, cracking them open with a stone. "They're better fresh," he says, ripping a chunk of flesh from a shell and popping it into his mouth. His eyes are still puffy but I pretend not to notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬尼克正坐在沙地上，用石头把蛤蜊敲开。“蛤蜊最好是新鲜的。”他说着，把一大块蛤蜊肉挖下来，塞到嘴里。他的眼泡好肿的，可我假装没看见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's like you're decomposing," says Finnick. But I guess the itching wins out, because after a minute Finnick begins to treat his own skin, too. Really, the combination of the scabs and the ointment looks hideous. I can't help enjoying his distress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的腿像烂梨似的。”芬尼克说。可是，我猜他也痒得难受，几分钟之后，他终于忍不住也抹上药膏。是啊，腿上结的痂和药膏连在一起看着确实让人恶心。看他那副难受样，还真让我挺开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I plunk down on the sand next to Finnick and screw the lid off the tube. Inside is a thick, dark ointment with a pungent smell, a combination of tar and pine needles. I wrinkle my nose as I squeeze a glob of the medicine onto my palm and begin to massage it into my leg. A sound of pleasure slips out of my mouth as the stuff eradicates my itching. It also stains my scabby skin a ghastly gray-green. As I start on the second leg I toss the tube to Finnick, who eyes me doubtfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我扑通一声趴在芬尼克身边的沙地上，拧开药膏的盖子，发现里面是一种黑色黏稠的药膏，有股刺鼻的焦油和松枝的混合味道。我拧着鼻子，把一小点药膏挤到手心，然后抹到腿上，结痂的腿变成了难看的深绿色，可是却立刻不痒了，我轻松地舒了一口气。我在另一条腿上也抹上药膏，之后把药膏扔给芬尼克，他用怀疑的眼神看着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's almost funny how quickly the parachute appears above me. I reach up and the tube lands squarely in my open hand. "About time," I say, but I can't keep the scowl on my face. Haymitch. What I wouldn't give for five minutes of conversation with him.</div>

By the time we pull ourselves together, I'm thinking that maybe Finnick Odair is all right. At least not as vain or self-important as I'd thought. Not so bad at all, really. And just as I've come to this conclusion, a parachute lands next to us with a fresh loaf of bread.

Not just because it gives relief from the itching, but also because it acts as protection from that blazing white sun in the pink sky. By its position, I estimate it must be going on ten o'clock, that we've been in the arena for about a day. Eleven of us are dead. Thirteen alive. Somewhere in the jungle, ten are concealed.

<div class="line_en">For me, the jungle has quickly evolved from a place of protection to a sinister trap. I know at some point we'll be forced to reenter its depths, either to hunt or be hunted, but for right now I'm planning to stick to our little beach. And I don't hear Peeta or Finnick suggesting we do otherwise. For a while the jungle seems almost static, humming, shimmering, but not flaunting its dangers. Then, in the distance, comes screaming. Across from us, a wedge of the jungle begins to vibrate. An enormous wave crests high on the hill, topping the trees and roaring down the slope. It hits the existing seawater with such force that, even though we're as far as we can get from it, the surf bubbles up around our knees, setting our few possessions afloat. Among the three of us, we manage to collect everything before it's carried off, except for our chemical-riddled jumpsuits, which are so eaten away no one cares if we lose them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说，丛林从一个遮风挡雨的栖身之处，很快变成了一个荆棘满途的险恶世界。我知道，到一定时候，我们不得不涉险进入其中，去厮杀或者被杀，但现在，我还想继续待在可爱的沙滩上。皮塔和芬尼克建议我们去别处，我一概不听。此时的丛林，寂然无声，在阳光的照耀下，泛着柔和的光，丝毫没有展露它的危险。但，突然，从远处传来了叫喊声。我们对面的丛林开始摇晃震动，掀起齐树高的巨浪，巨浪涌上山坡，又咆哮着从山坡滚下，拍打着浪花翻卷的海水。尽管我们极力奔逃，水还是没过我们的膝盖，我们那点可怜的财产也漂到水里，我们三个赶紧在浪花没把东西卷走之前，把能拿到的抢到手。只有被腐蚀的连裤衫除外，因为已经太破，没人在乎了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The circle of water slowly calms down, having absorbed the giant wave. We rearrange our things back on the wet sand and are about to settle down when I see them. Three figures, about two spokes away, stumbling onto the beach. "There," I say quietly, nodding in the newcomers' direction. Peeta and Finnick follow my gaze. As if by previous agreement, we all fade back into the shadows of the jungle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水面在巨浪翻卷过后，终于平静下来。我们在湿沙地上重新整理了一下东西，刚要定下神来，却看到了距离我们有两个“辐条”远的地方，出现了三个人，他们正磕磕绊绊地往沙滩上爬。“看。”我轻声地说，一边朝他们那边点头示意。皮塔和芬尼克顺着我示意的方向看去，马上不约而同地隐藏到丛林里的树荫下面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trio's in bad shape -- you can see that right off. One is being practically dragged out by a second, and the third wanders in loopy circles, as if deranged. They're a solid brick-red color, as if they've been dipped in paint and left out to dry.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Guess not. Come on, then," I say grouchily, because even if I'd had a list of allies, Johanna Mason would definitely not have been on it. The two of us tromp down the beach to where Finnick and Johanna are just meeting up. As we move in closer, I see her companions, and confusion sets in. That's Beetee on the ground on his back and Wiress who's regained her feet to continue making loops. "She's got Wiress and Beetee."</div>

I sit Wiress in the shallows so she can get washed up a bit, but she just clutches her hands together and occasionally mumbles, "Tick, tock." I unhook Beetee's belt and find a heavy metal cylinder attached to the side with a rope of vines. I can't tell what it is, but if he thought it was worth saving, I'm not going to be the one who loses it. I toss it up on the sand. Beetee's clothes are glued to him with blood, so Peeta holds him in the water while I loosen them. It takes some time to get the jumpsuit off, and then we find his under-garments are saturated with blood as well. There's no choice but to strip him naked to get him clean, but I have to say this doesn't make much of an impression on me anymore. Our kitchen table's been full of so many naked men this year. You kind of get used to it after a while.</div>

<div class="line_en">I sit back on my heels, trying to think. What do I have to work with? Seawater? I feel like my mother when her first line of defense for treating everything was snow. I look over at the jungle. I bet there's a whole pharmacy in there if I knew how to use it. But these aren't my plants. Then I think about the moss Mags gave me to blow my nose. "Be right back," I tell Peeta. Fortunately the stuff seems to be pretty common in the jungle. I rip an armful from the nearby trees and carry it back to the beach. I make a thick pad out of the moss, place it on Beetee's cut, and secure it by tying vines around his body. We get some water into him and then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle.</div>
