Ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway, because Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, apparently unsure about where they should sit.

<div class="line_en">He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it; at once, all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished, plunging them into a state of semidarkness. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole Hall, the sparkling bright, bluey-whiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes. Everyone watched, waiting… A few people kept checking their watches…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他掏出魔杖，大幅度地挥了一下。即刻，除了南瓜灯里的那些蜡烛，其余的蜡烛都熄灭了，礼堂一下子陷入了一种半明半暗的状态。火焰杯现在放出夺目的光芒，比整个礼堂里的任何东西都明亮，那迸射着火星的蓝白色火焰简直有些刺眼。大家都注视着，等待着…几个人不停地看表…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again. Sparks began to fly from it. Next moment, a tongue of flame shot into the air, a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it -- the whole room gasped.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, the goblet is almost ready to make its decision," said Dumbledore. "I estimate that it requires one more minute. Now, when the champions' names are called, I would ask them please to come up to the top of the Hall, walk along the staff table, and go through into the next chamber" -- he indicated the door behind the staff table -- "where they will be receiving their first instructions."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，高脚杯就要做出决定了，”邓布利多说，“我估计还需要一分钟。听着，勇士的名字被宣布后，我希望他们走到礼堂顶端，再沿着教工桌子走过去，进入隔壁的那个房间——”他指了指教工桌子后面的那扇门，“——他们将在那里得到初步指导。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一点儿也不奇怪！”罗恩大喊道，这时掌声和欢呼声席卷了整个礼堂。哈利看见威克多尔·克鲁姆从斯莱特林的桌子旁站起来，没精打采地朝邓布利多走去。他向右一转，顺着教工桌子往前走，从那扇门进了隔壁的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No! " said Ron loudly, but nobody heard him except Harry; the uproar from the next table was too great. Every single Hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers' table. Indeed, the applause for Cedric went on so long that it was some time before Dumbledore could make himself heard again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“糟糕！”罗恩大声说，可是除了哈利，谁也没有听见，旁边桌子上的欢呼声简直震耳欲聋。每个赫奇帕奇同学都在跳上跳下，都在尖叫、跺脚，这时塞德里克从他们身边走过，脸上灿烂地笑着，朝教工桌子后面的那个房间走去。确实，给塞德里克的喝彩持续了很长时间，过了好久，邓布利多才使大家安静下来，听他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh look, they're all disappointed," Hermione said over the noise, nodding toward the remainder of the Beauxbatons party. "Disappointed" was a bit of an understatement, Harry thought. Two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms.</div>
