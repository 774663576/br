<div class="line_en">Judge Menefee, to whom men granted leadership and the initiatory as upon a silver salver, sprang from the coach at once. Four of his fellow-passengers followed, inspired by his example, ready to explore, to objurgate, to resist, to submit, to proceed, according as their prime factor might be inclined to sway them. The fifth passenger, a young woman, remained in the coach.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bildad had halted upon the shoulder of the first mountain spur. Two rail-fences, ragged-black, hemmed the road. Fifty yards above the upper fence, showing a dark blot in the white drifts, stood a small house. Upon this house descended -- or rather ascended -- Judge Menefee and his cohorts with boyish whoops born of the snow and stress. They called; they pounded at window and door. At the inhospitable silence they waxed restive; they assaulted and forced the pregnable barriers, and invaded the premises.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔达把马车停在第一道山脊的隆起部。路边是两道参差不齐的黑色木栅栏。离那道较高的栅栏五十码远，有一幢小房子，在白茫茫的积雪中象是一块黑斑。法官梅尼菲和他的部下由于下雪和紧张，仿佛孩子似地闹闹嚷嚷地向那座房子跑去。他们呼喊，敲打门窗。屋里不好客的阒寂使他们感到不耐烦；他们便向不牢固的障碍物发动进攻，硬闯了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Twenty miles out from Paradise, and fifteen miles short of Sunrise City, Bildad Rose, the stage-driver, stopped his team. A furious snow had been falling all day. Eight inches it measured now, on a level. The remainder of the road was not without peril in daylight, creeping along the ribs of a bijou range of ragged mountains. Now, when both snow and night masked its dangers, further travel was not to be thought of, said Bildad Rose. So he pulled up his four stout horses, and delivered to his five passengers oral deductions of his wisdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出了乐园城二十英里，离日出城还有十五英里时，马车夫比尔达·罗斯勒住了马。鹅毛大雪下了一整天。平地上的积雪已有八英寸厚。剩下的路程都是狭隘崎岖的山脊，即使白天行车都难免不出危险。现在大雪和夜色掩盖了险情，再往前赶路根本不能考虑，比尔达·罗斯这样说。因此，他勒住了四匹健壮的马，把他那明智的推论传达给五位乘客。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The watchers from the coach heard stumblings and shoutings from the interior of the ravaged house. Before long a light within flickered, glowed, flamed high and bright and cheerful. Then came running back through the driving flakes the exuberant explorers. More deeply pitched than the clarion -- even orchestral in volume -- the voice of Judge Menefee proclaimed the succour that lay in apposition with their state of travail. The one room of the house was uninhabited, he said, and bare of furniture; but it contained a great fireplace, and they had discovered an ample store of chopped wood in a lean-to at the rear. Housing and warmth against the shivering night were thus assured. For the placation of Bildad Rose there was news of a stable, not ruined beyond service, with hay in a loft, near the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呆在马车上的人听到那座遭到入侵的房子里传出碰撞声和叫喊声。没多久，里面透出了颤动的火光，越来越旺，烧得明亮欢快。接着，兴高采烈的探索者们冒着大雪跑回来。法官梅尼菲宣布他们的困境有了解救，他的声音比号角还要响亮，几乎可以和管弦乐队的音量相比。他说，那座屋子只有一个房间，没人住，也没有家具；可是有个大壁炉；他们还在后面的披屋里找到许多砍好的木柴。这一来，躲避寒夜的宿处和取暖就有了保证。让比尔达安心的是，房子附近还有一个马厩，虽然年久失修，但还能凑和使用，阁楼上还有干草。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have to announce, Miss Garland," said he, "the enforced suspension of our journey. The driver asserts that the risk in travelling the mountain road by night is too great even to consider. It will be necessary to remain in the shelter of this house until morning. I beg that you will feel that there is nothing to fear beyond a temporary inconvenience. I have personally inspected the house, and find that there are means to provide against the rigour of the weather, at least. You shall be made as comfortable as possible. Permit me to assist you to alight."</div>

The exhorted team tugged the coach up the slant to the door of the edifice from which a mid-summer madness had ravished its proprietor. The driver and two of the passengers began to unhitch. Judge Menefee opened the door of the coach, and removed his hat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again must it be gently urged that in travelling from Paradise to Sunrise City an accurate name is prodigality. When Judge Menefee -- sanctioned to the act by his grey hair and widespread repute -- had introduced himself to the lady passenger, she had, herself, sweetly breathed a name, in response, that the hearing of the male passengers had variously interpreted. In the not unjealous spirit of rivalry that eventuated, each clung stubbornly to his own theory. For the lady passenger to have reasseverated or corrected would have seemed didactic if not unduly solicitous of a specific acquaintance. Therefore the lady passenger permitted herself to be Garlanded and McFarlanded and Solomoned with equal and discreet complacency. It is thirty-five miles from Paradise to Sunrise City. Compagnon de voyage is name enough, by the gripsack of the Wandering Jew! for so brief a journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里还得罗唆几句：从乐园城到日出城这么短的旅程中，正确的姓名完全是多余的。当法官梅尼菲向那位女乘客自我介绍时（他的年龄和声望允许他这样做），她甜蜜地轻声报了一个姓，其余的男乘客根据各人不同的听法，有了不同的理解。在当时必然发生的不无妒忌的竞争状态下，各人固执地坚持自己的意见。在女乘客那方面来说，如果重新声明或更正，即使不被人误会为她想获得更深一步的交情，也显得斤斤计较。因此，她一视同仁地让人家称呼她加兰，麦克法兰，或者所罗门，并没有表示不满。从乐园城到日落城总共不过三十五英里。在这么短的旅程中，凭“流浪的犹太人”①的手提包起誓，“旅伴”这个称呼也就够了。（注：①“流浪的犹太人”：传说中的人物，据说他侮辱了被押赴刑场的耶稣，被罚永世流浪。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Guess you'll have to climb out of the ark, Mrs. McFarland. This wigwam isn't exactly the Palmer House, but it turns snow, and they won't search your grip for souvenir spoons when you leave.

<div class="line_en">One of the two passengers who were struggling in a melee of horses, harness, snow, and the sarcastic injunctions of Bildad Rose, called loudly from the whirl of his volunteer duties: "Say! some of you fellows get Miss Solomon into the house, will you? Whoa, there! you confounded brute!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon the little party of wayfarers were happily seated in a cheerful arc before the roaring fire. The robes, cushions, and removable portions of the coach had been brought in and put to service. The lady passenger chose a place near the hearth at one end of the arc. There she graced almost a throne that her subjects had prepared. She sat upon cushions and leaned against an empty box and barrel, robe bespread, which formed a defence from the invading draughts. She extended her feet, delectably shod, to the cordial heat. She ungloved her hands, but retained about her neck her long fur boa. The unstable flames half revealed, while the warding boa half submerged, her face -- a youthful face, altogether feminine, clearly moulded and calm with beauty's unchallenged confidence. Chivalry and manhood were here vying to please and comfort her. She seemed to accept their devoirs -- not piquantly, as one courted and attended; nor preeningly, as many of her sex unworthily reap their honours; not yet stolidly, as the ox receives his hay; but concordantly with nature's own plan -- as the lily ingests the drop of dew foreordained to its refreshment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久，这一小群旅客在熊熊的炉火前快活地围坐成一道弧线。马车上的毯子、座垫和能取下的东西都被搬来用上了。女乘客在壁炉侧边、弧线的一端就座。她雍容华贵地坐在那儿，仿佛登上了臣民们替她准备的宝座。她身下是马车座垫，背靠空木箱和空木桶，那上面蒙了毯子，挡住门窗缝里钻进来的寒风。她那双穿着暖和的鞋袜的脚伸向可亲的炉火。她的手套已经脱去，但仍旧裹着一条毛皮的长围脖。摇曳的火光照亮了她那半掩在围脖里的脸——一张年轻的、充满女性妩媚的脸蛋，眉清目秀，安详宁谧，流露着对无懈可击的美貌的自信。骑士精神和男子气概竞争着讨她的欢心，使她舒适。她仿佛也接受了他们奉献的殷勤——不象一个受到追求和照顾的女人那样轻佻；不象许多受宠若惊的女人那样顾影自怜；也不象牛接受干草时那样漠然无动于衷；而同自然界固有的计划完全一致——有如百合花摄取那注定要使它清新的露珠时的情形。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the wind roared mightily, the fine snow whizzed through the cracks, the cold besieged the backs of the immolated six; but the elements did not lack a champion that night. Judge Menefee was attorney for the storm. The weather was his client, and he strove by special pleading to convince his companions in that frigid jury-box that they sojourned in a bower of roses, beset only by benignant zephyrs. He drew upon a fund of gaiety, wit, and anecdote, sophistical, but crowned with success. His cheerfulness communicated itself irresistibly. Each one hastened to contribute his own quota toward the general optimism. Even the lady passenger was moved to expression.</div>

He'd duck his head inside and slam the door whenever a team drove along. There was spinning-wheels up in his loft, all right. He used to buy his groceries and tobacco at Sam Tilly's store, on the Little Muddy. Last August he went up there dressed in a red bedquilt, and told Sam he was King Solomon, and that the Queen of Sheba was coming to visit him. He fetched along all the money he had -- a little bag full of silver -- and dropped it in Sam's well. 'She won't come,' says old man Redruth to Sam, 'if she knows I've got any money.'</div>

He was engaged to this young lady -- Miss Alice -- something was her name; I've forgot. This man said she was the kind of girl you like to have reach across you in a car to pay the fare. Well, there come to the town a young chap all affluent and easy, and fixed up with buggies and mining stock and leisure time. Although she was a staked claim, Miss Alice and the new entry seemed to strike a mutual kind of a clip.

Indeed, it is so constantly associated with the culinary and the commercial that it is hardly to be classed among the polite fruits. But in ancient times this was not so. Biblical, historical, and mythological lore abounds with evidences that the apple was the aristocrat of fruits. We still say 'the apple of the eye' when we wish to describe something superlatively precious. We find in Proverbs the comparison to 'apples of silver.' No other product of tree or vine has been so utilised in figurative speech. Who has not heard of and longed for the 'apples of the Hesperides'? I need not call your attention to the most tremendous and significant instance of the apple's ancient prestige when its consumption by our first parents occasioned the fall of man from his state of goodness and perfection."</div>

The few facts that we have learned seem to me to open up a fascinating field for conjecture, for the study of human hearts, for the exercise of the imagination -- in short, for story-telling. Let us make use of the opportunity. Let each one of us relate his own version of the story of Redruth, the hermit, and his lady-love, beginning where Mr. Rose's narrative ends -- at the parting of the lovers at the gate. This much should be assumed and conceded -- that the young lady was not necessarily to blame for Redruth's becoming a crazed and world-hating hermit. When we have done, Miss Garland shall render the JUDGEMENT OF WOMAN. As the Spirit of her Sex she shall decide which version of the story best and most truly depicts human and love interest, and most faithfully estimates the character and acts of Redruth's betrothed according to the feminine view. The apple shall be bestowed upon him who is awarded the decision. If you are all agreed, we shall be pleased to hear the first story from Mr. Dinwiddie."</div>
