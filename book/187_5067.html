<div class="line_en">From where he was he could still see the little stable on the top of the hill and the Ape sitting in front of it. He could just hear the Ape's voice still going on and, every now and then, some answer from the crowd, but he could not make out the words.</div>

<div class="line_en">The King was so dizzy from being knocked down that he hardly knew what was happening until the Calormenes untied his wrists and put his arms straight down by his sides and set him with his back against an ash tree. Then they bound ropes round his ankles and his knees and his waist and his chest and left him there. What worried him worst at the moment -- for it is often little things that are hardest to stand -- was that his lip was bleeding where they had hit him and he couldn't wipe the little trickle of blood away although it tickled him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王给打得晕头晕脑地倒下了，他不知道正在发生什么事，直至卡乐门人缚住他的腕关节，叫他的两臂笔直下垂在身体的两侧，背脊靠在一棵枝树上。然后他们用绳索团团捆住他的踝关节、膝关节、腰部和胸膛，这就把他丢在那儿了。此时此刻，使他忧虑重重的，倒是他的嘴唇在出血，他们打破了他的嘴唇，他没法儿擦掉伤口滴出来的血，痒得难受——时常是小小的事情最难受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently the crowd of beasts broke up and began going away in different directions. Some passed close to Tirian. They looked at him as if they were both frightened and sorry to see him tied up but none of them spoke. Soon they had all gone and there was silence in the wood. Then hours and hours went past and Tirian became first very thirsty and then very hungry; and as the afternoon dragged on and turned into evening, he became cold too. His back was very sore. The sun went down and it began to be twilight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这群野兽不久就散开了，开始朝着不同的方向走掉了。有的就在蒂莲身边走过。它们瞧瞧他，看到他绑在树上，它们仿佛感到害怕而又抱歉，但它们谁也不说话。不久，它们都走掉了，树林里一片寂静。时间一个钟头又一个钟头地过去，蒂莲起初感到十分口渴，后来又感到十分饥饿；拖延到傍晚时，他感到寒冷了。他的背脊疼痛。太阳落山了，黄昏开始了。'">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At once the first Mouse climbed nimbly up till he was perched on the rope that bound Tirian's chest and was wrinkling his blunt nose in front of Tirian's face. Then the second Mouse climbed up and hung on just below the first Mouse. The other beasts stood on the ground and began handing things up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一只老鼠立刻敏捷地爬了上来，它的脚踩在缚住蒂莲胸膛的绳索上，它对着蒂莲的脸，正在翕动它那迟钝的鼻子。然后第二只老鼠爬了上来，挂在第一只老鼠的下面。其余的小兽都站在地上，开始把食物递上来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When it was almost dark Tirian heard a light pitter-patter of feet and saw some small creatures coming towards him. The three on the left were Mice, and there was a Rabbit in the middle: on the right were two Moles. Both these were carrying little bags on their backs which gave them a curious look in the dark so that at first he wondered what kind of beasts they were. Then, in a moment, they were all standing up on their hind legs, laying their cool paws on his knees and giving his knees snuffly animal kisses. (They could reach his knees because Narnian Talking Beasts of that sort are bigger than the dumb beasts of the same kind in England.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色几乎全黑时，蒂莲听到一种轻微的窸窸窣窣的脚步声，看到有些小动物在朝他走过来。左边三只是老鼠，中间一只是野兔，右边两只是鼹鼠。这些小动物的背上都驮着个小袋子，这就使它们在黑暗中显得奇形怪状，乍一看时，认不出它们是什么动物。一会儿之后，它们都用后腿站起来了，把它们冰凉的脚爪按在国王的膝头上，而且抽抽噎噎地给他的膝头以野兽的接吻。（它们能够够得上国王的膝头，因为纳尼亚的会说人话的这种小兽，比我们英国的同类小兽身材要高大得多。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here is cheese, Sire," said the first Mouse, "but not very much, for fear it would make you too thirsty." And after the cheese they fed him with oat-cakes and fresh butter, and then with some more wine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是干酪，陛下，”第一只老鼠说道，“可是东西不多，恐怕你多吃了会口渴。”干酷之后，它们又喂国王吃燕麦饼和鲜黄油，然后又给他喝些酒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Drink, Sire, and then you'll find you are able to eat," said the topmost Mouse, and Tirian found that a little wooden cup was being held to his lips. It was only the size of an egg cup so that he had hardly tasted the wine in it before it was empty. But then the Mouse passed it down and the others re-filled it and it was passed up again and Tirian emptied it a second time. In this way they went on till he had quite a good drink, which was all the better for coming in little doses, for that is more thirst-quenching than one long draught.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喝吧，陛下，喝过以后，你就会发觉自己能吃东西了。”站在最上面的老鼠说道，蒂莲发觉一个小木杯送到了他嘴边。它只有一个蛋杯那么大小，所以，他还没尝到酒的味道，杯子就空了。但老鼠随即把杯子递了下去，其他的老鼠重新斟满酒，重新递了上来，于是蒂蓬第二次把酒喝干了。它们就这样继续递上递下，直至国王喝了个痛快，一小杯一小杯的品味，倒比大碗牛饮好得多，因为它更解渴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="繁星出来了，时间慢吞吞地过去——试想那时间过得多么缓慢——在这过程中，纳尼亚王国最后一位国王给绑在树上，站得四肢僵硬，筋骨酸痛。但，最后，有件事情发生啦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“晚安，晚安。”小兽们一边说，一边在国王的膝头上擦着鼻子，“我们会回来的——如果我们办得到的话。”于是大家窸窸窣窣地走掉了，同它们来到之前相比较，树林似乎更加黑暗、更加寒冷、更加寂寞了。8">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Far away there appeared a red light. Then it disappeared for a moment and came back again, bigger and stronger. Then he could see dark shapes going to and fro on this side of the light and carrying bundles and throwing them down. He knew now what he was looking at. It was a bonfire, newly lit, and people were throwing bundles of brushwood on to it. Presently it blazed up and Tirian could see that it was on the very top of the hill. He could see quite clearly the stable behind it, all lit up in the red glow, and a great crowd of Beasts and Men between the fire and himself. A small figure, hunched up beside the fire, must be the Ape. It was saying something to the crowd, but he could not hear what. Then it went and bowed three times to the ground in front of the door of the stable. Then it got up and opened the door. And something on four legs -- something that walked rather stiffly -- came out of the stable and stood facing the crowd.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Ape put his head close up to the yellow thing's head as if he were listening to something it was whispering to him. Then he turned and spoke to the crowd, and the crowd wailed again. Then the yellow thing turned clumsily round and walked -- you might almost say, waddled -- back into the stable and the Ape shut the door behind it. After that the fire must have been put out for the light vanished quite suddenly, and Tirian was once more alone with the cold and the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无尾猿把他的头挨近黄色畜生的脑袋，仿佛它在静听某些讲给它听的悄悄话。然后它转而向群众讲话，群众重又哀号了。接着，黄色畜生笨拙地转过身体，然后迈步走回去——几乎可以说是蹒跚而行——走进了马厩，无尾猿便在它背后把门关上。这之后，篝火必定是被扑灭了，因为光芒突然消失；而蒂莲又重新独自面对着寒冷和黑暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From where Tirian was he could not make out very clearly what the thing was; but he could see that it was yellow and hairy. He had never seen the Great Lion. He had never seen a common lion. He couldn't be sure that what he saw was not the real Aslan. He had not expected Aslan to look like that stiff thing which stood and said nothing.

<div class="line_cn" title="从蒂莲所站的地方望过去，他没法十分清楚地看出来它是什么东西，但他看得出它是黄黄的、浑身都是毛。他从来没有见过伟大的狮王。他也从来没见过一头普通的狮子。他没有把握肯定他所看到的不是阿斯兰。他不曾料到阿斯兰竟看上去像那条站着不说话的、呆板僵化的畜生。然而，怎样才能有把握呢？片刻之间，恐怖的思想兜上他的心头：接着他记起了关于塔什和阿斯兰是同一个神祇的信口雌黄，觉得这整个儿事情必定是个骗局。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought of other Kings who had lived and died in Narnia in old times and it seemed to him that none of them had ever been so unlucky as himself. He thought of his great-grandfather's great-grandfather King Rilian who had been stolen away by a Witch when he was only a young prince and kept hidden for years in the dark caves beneath the land of the Northern Giants. But then it had all come; right in the end, for two mysterious children had suddenly appeared from the land beyond the world's end and had rescued him so that he came home to Narnia and had a long and prosperous reign. "It's not like that with me," said Tirian to himself. Then he went further back and: thought about Rilian's father, Caspian the Seafarer, whose wicked uncle King Miraz had tried to murder him and how Caspian had fled away into the woods and lived among the Dwarfs. But that story too had all come right in the end: for Caspian also had been helped by children -- only there were four of them that time -- who came from somewhere beyond the world and fought a great battle and set him on his father's throne. "But it was all long ago," said Tirian to himself. "That sort of thing doesn't happen now." And then he remembered (for he had always been good at history when he was a boy) how those same four children who had helped Caspian had been in Narnia over a thousand years before; and it was then that they had done the most remarkable thing of all. For then they had defeated the terrible White Witch and ended the Hundred Years of Winter, and after that they had reigned (all four of them together) at Cair Paravel, till they were no longer children but great Kings and lovely Queens, and their reign had been the golden age of Narnia. And Aslan had come into that story a lot. He had come into all the other stories too, as Tirian now remembered. "Aslan -- and children from another world," thought Tirian. "They have always come in when things were at their worst. Oh, if only they could now."</div>

Two of those people were very old, an old man with a white beard and an old woman with wise, merry, twinkling eyes. He who sat at the right hand of the old man was hardly full grown, certainly younger than Tirian himself, but his face had already the look of a king and a warrior. And you could almost say the same of the other youth who sat at the right hand of the old woman. Facing Tirian across the table sat a fair-haired girl younger than either of these, and on either side of her a boy and girl who were younger still. They were all dressed in what seemed to Tirian the oddest kind of clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he had no time to think about details like that, for instantly the younger boy and both the girls started to their feet, and one of them gave a little scream. The old woman started and drew in her breath sharply. The old man must have made some sudden movement too for the wine glass which stood at his right hand was swept off the table: Tirian could hear the tinkling noise as it broke on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他没有时间去考虑这些细节，因为最年轻的男孩和两个小姑娘立刻从座位上跳起身来，有一位还发出了一声轻微的叫喊。老妇人吃了一惊，猛吸了一口气。老汉必定也做出了一个突然动作，因为放在他右手边的酒杯，给碰下桌子去了，蒂莲听得见酒杯啪啦跌碎在地板上时的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tirian was longing to speak, and he tried to cry out aloud that he was Tirian of Narnia, in great need of help. But he found (as I have sometimes found in dreams too) that his voice made no noise at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲很想说话，他力图大声喊叫，他是纳尼亚王国的蒂莲，迫切需要帮助。但他发觉（就像我们在梦里也常发觉的那样）他的嗓门里发不出声音来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Tirian realized that these people could see him; they were staring at him as if they saw a ghost. But he noticed that the king-like one who sat at the old man's right never moved (though he turned pale) except that he clenched his hand very tight. Then he said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是蒂莲认识到这些人能看见他，他们正瞪眼瞧着他，仿佛他们看见了一个鬼魂似的。但他也看在眼里：坐在老汉身旁的那位国王模样的人，可从未动弹过（尽管他的脸色变白了），只不过把他的手捏得紧紧的而已。接着他就说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The one who had already spoken to him rose to his feet. "Shadow or spirit or whatever you are," he said, fixing his eyes full upon Tirian. "If you are from Narnia, I charge you in the name of Aslan, speak to me. I am Peter the High King."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="已经对他说话的那个人站起身来了。“影子也好，鬼魂也好，不论你究竟是什么人，”他一边说一边盯住蒂莲直瞧，“如果你来自纳尼亚，我以阿斯兰的名义命令你，把话对我说出来吧。我就是大国王彼得。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The room began to swim before Tirian's eyes. He heard the voices of those seven people all speaking at once, and all getting fainter every second, and they were saying things like, "Look! It's fading."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这房间开始在蒂莲的眼前摇摇晃晃。他听到这七个人立刻一齐说话的声音，而且声音都在一秒钟又一秒钟地减弱下去，他们说的是类似这样的话“瞧，它在褪色了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's vanishing." Next moment he was wide awake, still tied to the tree, colder and stiffer than ever. The wood was full of the pale, dreary light that comes before sunrise, and he was soaking wet with dew; it was nearly morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它在消失了。”一会儿后他便完全从梦中醒过来了，仍旧绑在树上，比以前更加寒冷、僵硬。树林里充满了日出之前苍白而阴沉的光芒，他浑身被露水湿透，早晨快要来临了。">查看中文翻译</div>
