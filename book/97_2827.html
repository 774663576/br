<div class="line_en">The howling winds pushed against Kristoff as he headed back up the mountain, away from Arendelle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sven was lagging behind. The reindeer looked longingly back at Arendelle and the castle. He shook his head and whinnied. Kristoff kept walking, ignoring him. Sven charged ahead, passed Kristoff, and then stopped in front of him. He faced him and looked Kristoff directly in the eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯特落在后面，渴望地回头看着艾伦戴尔和城堡。他摇了摇头，嘶叫着。克斯托夫没有理睬他，继续往前走。斯特追了上去，拦在克斯托夫面前，直直地盯着他的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他调整了护目镜，紧了紧围巾，裹住脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reindeer nudged his antlers into Kristoff's side.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sven shook his head and wiggled his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯特摇了摇头，动了动嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't understand you when you talk that way," Kristoff told him. In a flash, Sven bucked Kristoff and lifted him up with his antlers. "Hey! Stop it!" Kristoff shouted. "Put me down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这样说话，我可不明白。”克斯托夫说。突然，斯特弓起背，用角将克斯托夫抬了起来。“嘿！停下！”克斯托夫喊道，“放我下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sven dropped him straight into the snow, hard. "No, Sven," Kristoff said. "We're not going back." Sven snorted his disapproval.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯特把他扔到了雪地上。“不，斯特，”克斯托夫说，“我们不回去。”斯特发出哼哼的声音，表示反对。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，小心点儿。”克斯托夫有些生气地说，“你怎么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's with her true love." Kristoff saw Sven's doubt. He glanced back at the kingdom to make his point. But to his surprise, he saw a strange new storm swirling above the castle. He could see dark clouds forming, and more ice on the castle walls, putting it into an even deeper freeze. "Anna!" he cried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她和她的真爱在一起。”克斯托夫看出斯特一脸疑问。他回头看了一眼王国以证明自己的观点。令他惊讶的是，他发现城堡上方刮起了一阵诡异的冰雪风暴。只见黑云聚拢，城堡墙壁上结了更多的冰，冻得更加厉害了。“安娜！”他喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Anna was curled up on the floor of the library. She had made it to the door but was now too weak to stand. No one could hear her whispered cries for help. She was so cold -- and her heart ached.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜蜷缩在图书馆冰冷的地板上。她好不容易爬到了门口，但实在没有力气站起来了。没人能听到她微弱的求救声。她浑身冰冷，心脏疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment, the door handle jiggled. Anna was barely able to raise her head to see who it was. The lock clicked. Anna could see a carrot wedged into the keyhole…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，门把手微微动了一下。安娜都没有力气抬头看是谁。门锁打开了，安娜看见一根胡萝卜插在钥匙孔里…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Olaf," Anna said. "Get away from there!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雪宝，”安娜说，“离那儿远点！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instantly, Kristoff changed his course and took off running toward Arendelle. Sven scrambled and raced up behind him. He ducked his head and lifted Kristoff with his antlers, then threw him onto his back. The duo raced down the hillside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克斯托夫立即改变方向，向艾伦戴尔飞奔而去。斯特在他身后奋力追赶。他低头用角将克斯托夫抬起，扔上了自己的后背，一起向山下飞奔而去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, the door flew open. It was Olaf! The snowman pulled his carrot nose out of the lock and put it back into the middle of his face. He was very proud of himself, but his happiness melted the moment he saw Anna.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，门打开了。是雪宝！他把胡萝卜鼻子从锁孔里拔了出来，插回到自己脸中间。他很得意自己想出的办法，但当他看见安娜时，他的兴奋劲儿立刻消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anna, no!" he called. He ran to the fireplace and struck a match. In seconds there was a large, roaring fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪，安娜！”他喊道。他连忙跑到火炉边点着了一根火柴，很快熊熊火焰蹿了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Whoa!" Olaf exclaimed, taking in the sight and feel of the fire. He was a little scared, but he couldn't resist the warmth coming from the fireplace. "So that's heat," he said. "I gotta say, I still like it!" He hurried over to Anna and brought her closer to the fire. "So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嚯！”雪宝喊道，这才认识并感受到了火。他有点被吓到了，不过还是抵抗不了火炉温暖的诱惑。“原来这就是热啊，”他说，“不得不说，我还是很喜欢这种感觉的！”他跑过去扶起安娜，把她扶到靠近火炉的地方，问道：“汉斯呢？你们吻过了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was wrong about him," Anna said. "It wasn't true love."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看错了他，”安娜说，“他并不是真的爱我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anna sighed heavily. "I don't even know what love is anymore."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜长叹一声说：“我甚至都不知道什么是爱了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, Olaf," Anna managed to say. "You can't stay here. You'll melt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拜托，雪宝，”安娜无力地说，“你不能待在这里，你会融化的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“克斯托夫爱我？”安娜睁大了眼睛问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Olaf nodded. "You really don't know anything about love, do you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪宝点点头：“你对爱真的是一点概念都没有，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not leaving until we find some other act of true love to save you," Olaf said. He sat down next to Anna. "Got any ideas?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在帮你找到可以救你的真爱行动之前，我是不会走的。”雪宝说着坐在了安娜边上，问道，“你想到什么主意了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Some people are worth melting for," he said. His face was quickly losing its shape. Olaf tried to push up his sagging head. He ran and sat behind Anna, trying to escape the fire's heat. "Just maybe not right this second."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些人值得我融化。”他说。他的脸很快就变形了。雪宝把下垂的头往上推了推，跑去坐到了安娜后面，好离火远一点。“现在还不是时候。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Olaf didn't want to believe it. "But we rode all the way here," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪宝简直不能相信：“可我们费尽千辛万苦才到了这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anna looked at Olaf. He was dripping from head to toe! "Olaf, you're melting!" she cried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜看着雪宝。他浑身都在滴水！“雪宝，你要融化了！”安娜惊叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's okay," Olaf said. "I do." He sat up a little taller. "Love is putting someone else's needs before yours -- like, you know how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，我知道。”雪宝说着坐直了身子。“爱，就是把别人看得比自己还重要。比如，克斯托夫不辞辛苦地把你送到汉斯身边，然后永远地离开。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wow, he's moving really fast!" Olaf said. "Huh, I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，我想他正在超速驾驶！”雪宝说，“看来我说错了。克斯托夫没有爱你爱到能放手不管。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A window across the room blew open and a cold gust of wind swept through. Anna shuddered. Olaf ran to the window to shut it. "Don't worry," he said. "I've got it. We're gonna get through…" He stopped talking and stared out the window. He leaned forward and squinted at the horizon. "Hang on, just one second. I'm getting something!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间那头的窗户被吹开了，一阵冷风吹了进来。安娜打了个寒战。雪宝跑去关上了窗。“别担心，”他说，“我来搞定。我们能挺过去的…”他不说话了，看向窗外。他身体前倾，看着远方。“坚持一会儿。我有办法了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They are?" Anna asked. She tried to stand up to see for herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是他们吗？”安娜努力站起来想要亲眼看一看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“扶我起来，”安娜挣扎着说，“求你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reached through the open window and grabbed an icicle off the window ledge. He flipped the icicle around and used it as a telescope. "Hey, Kristoff and Sven!" he shouted when he realized who was running toward the castle. He turned to Anna excitedly. "They're coming back this way!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他够到开着的窗户，从窗沿上折下一根冰柱，将冰柱反了过来用作望远镜。“嘿，是克斯托夫和斯特！”认出是他们正向城堡飞奔而来时，雪宝激动地叫道。他高兴地回头冲安娜喊道：“他们朝这边来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Olaf told her. "You need to stay by the fire and keep warm."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why?" Olaf asked. Then he paused. "Oh, I know why! There's your act of true love right there, riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king!" He reached for Anna. "Come on!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？”雪宝问。然后又停了停，说：“我知道为什么了！他就是能救你的真爱，一位英勇无比、臭烘烘的驯鹿王子，正像勇士一般穿过峡湾来救你！”他拉起安娜，说：“来吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sheets of ice began to break through the library walls. The cracks grew across the walls, and the room began to collapse. Anna and Olaf hurried out of the library just in time. Together, they struggled to make it through the hallway, dodging ice as it appeared in their path.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图书馆墙壁的冰层开始破裂。墙壁间的裂缝越来越大，房间开始倾倒。安娜和雪宝及时跑出了图书馆。他们俩一起艰难地穿过走廊，躲过了路上出现的冰雪。">查看中文翻译</div>
