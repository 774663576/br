<div class="line_en">Robert showed perpetual zeal in his studies and loyalty to his alliances. He never evaded responsibility, was never late, was quick and skillful in the use of weapons including sword. dagger and spear, etc. He also showed keenness in his shrewdness, was brave in battle, and famous for his honesty. A favorite among leaders and peers, he rose through the ranks to become the apprentice of the most famous and successful knight in the northern provinces.</div>

<div class="line_en">Janine's father was a shrewd man. He recognized and comprehended that Robert would be a fine mate for his daughter, but the lack of good ancestry didn't warrant the alliance between them. Lord Stafford was not vacant of feelings for the lad, and showed this when he entitled Robert to enter into the realm of knights. Lacking noble blood anchored his chances of becoming a knight, but if he verified the potential Lord Stafford recognized in him, he would discharge himself well, and possibly rise above his station.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珍妮的父亲是个精明的人。他意识到并理解罗伯特会是他女儿的一个很好的伴侣，但是由于缺乏良好的血统，他们之间的联姻并不是理所当然的。斯塔福德勋爵对这个小伙子的感情并不是空洞的，他在授权罗伯特进入骑士世界时就表现出了这一点。由于缺乏贵族血统，他成为骑士的机会不大，但如果他证实了斯塔福德勋爵对他的认可，他会很好地卸下自己的责任，并可能超越自己的地位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was clear from the beginning that they could have no future together. They were from two different worlds. Although Robert had grown into a strong, intelligent and handsome young man, his blood was not that of the royalty. This meant he could not woo Janine openly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he was deeply sorry. Janine had been kidnapped from her father's estate by the Earl of Morley and was being held as a hostage for ransom in one of his many jails. Lord Stafford had called upon Robert to come to his aid and to bring with him as many knights as possible to fulfill Janine's release. Robert's main objective was to rescue Janine and reclaiming her honor. He prayed he could do this before the conspiring kidnapper further hurt her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他深感遗憾。珍妮是被莫利伯爵从她父亲的庄园里绑架出来的，她被关在莫利伯爵的一个监狱里，作为人质要求赎金。斯塔福德勋爵呼吁罗伯特前来帮助他，并带来尽可能多的骑士来完成释放珍妮的任务。罗伯特的主要目的是拯救珍妮并重新获得她的荣誉。他祈祷自己能在绑架者进一步伤害她之前做到这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Janine's courage had thus far kept her from being bedded by the Earl of Morley; she reproached each time he approached. Herr raging temper and threats to hideously wrench and tramp him should he attempt to touch her were met with pretentious laughter. Besides, the Earl was involved in an enfeoffment confrontation of his own family. He didn't have time to try to win her over by being scheming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到目前为止，吉妮的勇气使她没有和莫利伯爵上床；每次他走近她，她都责备他。她暴躁的脾气和威胁如果他试图碰她就狠狠地揍他，这些都遭到了狂妄的嘲笑。此外，伯爵还卷入了自己家族的分封冲突中。他没有时间用诡计把她争取过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unable, still, to wed Janine, he entreated her to run away with him. Janine admitted that she wished to be with him, but the violation to the taboo of a secret marriage would bring disgrace upon her father and contaminate their good name. Robert was desolate and returned to his detachment, hoping she would change her mind and not abandon him.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the night she sensed a change. She thought she had become accustomed to her misfortune, accepting that her liberty would not be achieved before the Earl forced her to submit to him. Suddenly alert, she approached the window of her bed chamber. Through the window, in the distance she could see an orange glow reflected from the clouds and the odor of smoke drifted in the chill night air. "The village is on fire! Why would the Earl want to harm the peasants? He must be crazy! I have to get out of here before he returns!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜里，她感觉到了一种变化。她认为她已经习惯了自己的不幸，承认在伯爵强迫她屈服于他之前，她的自由是无法实现的。她突然警觉起来，走近卧室的窗户。透过窗户，远远地她可以看到一道橙色的光芒从云层中反射出来，还有烟雾的气味飘荡在寒冷的夜空中。“村子着火了！伯爵为什么要伤害农民？他一定是疯了！我必须在他回来之前离开这里！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Janine's plan to maintain a climate of vicious contempt in her refusal of the Earl. Every time she thought of Robert, she became increasingly silent. "Why did I have to be such an idiot?"she asked herself."If I had run off with him, none of this would have happened. My father's estates would not have been butchered. I would not be in peril. And if Robert finds me, I will have endangered his life by exposing him to this devil."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珍妮打算维持一种恶毒蔑视的气氛，拒绝伯爵。每次想起罗伯特，她就变得越来越沉默。“我为什么要这么白痴呢？”她问自己。“如果我跟他私奔，这一切都不会发生。我父亲的财产就不会被屠杀，我也不会有危险。如果罗伯特找到我，我就会把他暴露在魔鬼面前，危及他的生命。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inner annoyance troubled her every waking moment, even when she was sleeping it was restless. She began to lose hope. If someone didn't come soon, she would have to become the wife of the notorious nobleman. There was no point in asking him to release her. She knew inwardly that he would refuse her request.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她醒着的每一刻，内心的烦恼都困扰着她，即使是在睡觉的时候，它也是不安分的。她开始失去希望。如果有人不快点来，她将不得不成为臭名昭著的贵族的妻子。要求他释放她是毫无意义的。她心里知道他会拒绝她的要求。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment she started to prompt her own escape. She began to groan, softly at first, then mounting in frequency and volume.

<div class="line_en">The edge of the creek water was coated with newly formed ice, glossy and golden in the early morning sun. As beautiful as it was, it was risky when it slit beneath their feet, making so much noise to alert the enemy of their approach.

You acquitted yourself well, Robert. The King has heard of your exploits. He will tell you himself how you are to be rewarded.
