<div class="line_en">The shock of hearing Haymitch's voice yesterday, of learning that he was not only functional but had some measure of control over my life again, enraged me. I left the studio directly and refused to acknowledge his comments from the booth today. Even so, I knew immediately he was right about my performance.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took the whole of this morning for him to convince the others of my limitations. That I can't pull it off. I can't stand in a television studio wearing a costume and makeup in a cloud of fake smoke and rally the districts to victory. It's amazing, really, how long I have survived the cameras. The credit for that, of course, goes to Peeta. Alone, I can't be the Mockingjay.</div>

<div class="line_en">We gather around the huge table in Command. Coin and her people. Plutarch, Fulvia, and my prep team. A group from 12 that includes Haymitch and Gale, but also a few others I can't explain, like Leevy and Greasy Sae. At the last minute, Finnick wheels Beetee in, accompanied by Dalton, the cattle expert from 10. I suppose that Coin has assembled this strange assortment of people as witnesses to my failure.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, it's Haymitch who welcomes everyone, and by his words I understand that they have come at his personal invitation. This is the first time we've been in a room together since I clawed him. I avoid looking at him directly, but I catch a glimpse of his reflection in one of the shiny control consoles along the wall. He looks slightly yellow and has lost a lot of weight, giving him a shrunken appearance. For a second, I'm afraid he's dying. I have to remind myself that I don't care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没想到，黑密斯首先开口，对大家表示欢迎，看他说话的意思，好像是他个人向大家发出了邀请。在我抓伤他的脸之后，我们还第一次共处一室。我不愿正眼看他，但我能看到他映在墙壁的控制板上的身影。他脸色有点黄，看上去瘦了很多。不知怎么，我突然担心他时日无多，可我必须要提醒自己对他并不在乎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing Haymitch does is to show the footage we've just shot. I seem to have reached some new low under Plutarch and Fulvia's guidance. Both my voice and body have a jerky, disjointed quality, like a puppet being manipulated by unseen forces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯所做的第一件事就是要我们看刚拍摄的录像小样。录像中，在普鲁塔什和富尔维亚的指导下，我显得更加低调，我声音生硬，身体僵直，好像一个被无形的力量控制的提线木偶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right," Haymitch says when it's over. "Would anyone like to argue that this is of use to us in winning the war?" No one does. "That saves time. So, let's all be quiet for a minute. I want everyone to think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle, or her dress went up in flames or she made a halfway decent shot with an arrow. Not where Peeta was making you like her. I want to hear one moment where she made you feel something real."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。”录像放完后黑密斯说，“有没有人愿意说两句，你觉得这录像对于我们赢得这场战争有用吗？”没有人做声。“好吧，这样也省了时间。现在，请大家好好想想，凯特尼斯·伊夫狄恩有没有真正打动你的时候？不是她留着令人羡慕的新发型的时候，不是她身穿火焰服装出现在舞台上的时候，不是她凌空飞射的时候，也不是因为皮塔而让她变得更可爱的时候。我想听听有没有她让你实实在在觉得感动的时候？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm surprised that the next speaker is Boggs, who I think of as a muscular robot that does Coin's bidding. "When she sang the song. While the little girl died." Somewhere in my head an image surfaces of Boggs with a young boy perched up on his hip. In the dining hall, I think. Maybe he's not a robot after all.</div>

Defiance of the Capitol's inhumanity.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="让我重新投入战斗，这立刻引起了大家的热议。黑密斯的说法似乎顺理成章。如果我在现实生活中表现更为出色，那么我就应该投入到现实生活中去。黑密斯接着说：“每次我们训练她或者让她念现成的台词，她都表现一般。一切要发自内心，这样人们才会有反应。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我内心有一种失落感，并不是因为他没道歉，而是因为我们本应是一个团队。我们之间已经达成协议要尽力去救皮塔，虽然这是一个在夜晚他喝醉时达成的不现实的协议，但它仍然是一个协议。而在我内心的最深处，我知道我们俩都失败了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since I'll be in a combat zone, Beetee helps me with armor Cinna designed. A helmet of some interwoven metal that fits close to my head. The material's supple, like fabric, and can be drawn back like a hood in case I don't want it up full-time. A vest to reinforce the protection over my vital organs. A small white earpiece that attaches to my collar by a wire. Beetee secures a mask to my belt that I don't have to wear unless there's a gas attack. "If you see anyone dropping for reasons you can't explain, put it on immediately," he says. Finally, he straps a sheath divided into three cylinders of arrows to my back. "Just remember: Right side, fire. Left side, explosive. Center, regular. You shouldn't need them, but better safe than sorry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为我要进入战斗区域，比特帮我戴上西纳设计的头盔，这种头盔是由金属线织成的，紧贴着头部。头盔的材质很柔软，跟纤维类似，不用时可以像帽兜一样放下来。另外还有一件防护背心，护住了身体的关键部位。一个白色的小耳麦通过电线连在我的衣领上。比特又把一个面具拴在我腰带上，以便在遇到毒气弹袭击时使用。“如果你看到有人莫名其妙地倒下，你就赶紧把它戴上。”他说。最后，他把分成三格的箭袋背在我身后。“一定要记住：右边是火焰箭，左边是炸药箭，中间是普通箭。一般地，你用不上这些，但是关键时刻，保证安全是第一，总比留下遗憾好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Plutarch tries to lay it out in simple terms for me. First of all, every district is currently at war with the Capitol except 2, which has always had a favored relationship with our enemies despite its participation in the Hunger Games. They get more food and better living conditions. After the Dark Days and the supposed destruction of 13, District 2 became the Capitol's new center of defense, although it's publicly presented as the home of the nation's stone quarries, in the same way that 13 was known for graphite mining. District 2 not only manufactures weaponry, it trains and even supplies Peacekeepers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对目前的战事，普鲁塔什用直白的语言给我说明了一下。首先，目前除二区之外，其他各区都已经展开了对凯匹特的反抗斗争。二区尽管也参加饥饿游戏，但它与凯匹特的关系很特殊，二区得到的食物较多，生活条件也略好。在黑暗时期和十三区陷落之后，二区成为凯匹特新的防御中心。但对外，它只是生产矿石的区，就如同十三区对外称是生产石墨的区。但实际上，二区生产武器，训练治安警，甚至成为输送治安警的基地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Plutarch nods. "That's what you're supposed to think. And some do come from the Capitol. But its population could never sustain a force that size. Then there's the problem of recruiting Capitol-raised citizens for a dull life of deprivation in the districts. A twenty-year commitment to the Peacekeepers, no marriage, no children allowed. Some buy into it for the honor of the thing, others take it on as an alternative to punishment. For instance, join the Peacekeepers and your debts are forgiven. Many people are swamped in debt in the Capitol, but not all of them are fit for military duty. So District Two is where we turn for additional troops. It's a way for their people to escape poverty and a life in the quarries. They're raised with a warrior mind-set. You've seen how eager their children are to volunteer to be tributes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普鲁塔什点点头：“你可以这样认为，有些治安警确实来自凯匹特，但以凯匹特的人口，维持不了这么庞大的治安部队，另外，在凯匹特招募治安警，去让他们到各辖区过一种枯燥乏味的生活，这对他们而言也是一个问题。治安警的服役年限是二十年，不允许结婚，不允许生孩子。有些人花钱也要当治安警，为了荣耀什么的，其他人则认为当治安警比挨罚强。例如，加入治安警可以免去债务，凯匹特有许多人债务缠身。但并非所有的人都适合于服役。因此二区成为凯匹特的兵源地。对于他们而言，这也是逃离穷困生活和采石场艰苦劳动的一种途径。他们从小就接受士兵式的教育。你也看到他们的孩子们多么积极地参加饥饿游戏，自愿去当‘贡品’。”">查看中文翻译</div>
