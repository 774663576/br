<div class="line_en">Philip parted from Emma with tears, but the journey to Blackstable amused him, and, when they arrived, he was resigned and cheerful. Blackstable was sixty miles from London. Giving their luggage to a porter, Mr. Carey set out to walk with Philip to the vicarage; it took them little more than five minutes, and, when they reached it, Philip suddenly remembered the gate. It was red and five-barred: it swung both ways on easy hinges; and it was possible, though forbidden, to swing backwards and forwards on it. They walked through the garden to the front-door. This was only used by visitors and on Sundays, and on special occasions, as when the Vicar went up to London or came back. The traffic of the house took place through a side-door, and there was a back door as well for the gardener and for beggars and tramps. It was a fairly large house of yellow brick, with a red roof, built about five and twenty years before in an ecclesiastical style. The front-door was like a church porch, and the drawing-room windows were gothic.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip started to run, awkwardly, trailing his club-foot, and then stopped. Mrs. Carey was a little, shrivelled woman of the same age as her husband, with a face extraordinarily filled with deep wrinkles, and pale blue eyes. Her gray hair was arranged in ringlets according to the fashion of her youth. She wore a black dress, and her only ornament was a gold chain, from which hung a cross. She had a shy manner and a gentle voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普拖着他那条瘸腿奔跑起来，步态怪别扭的；他跑了几步又站住身子。凯里太太是个瘦小、干瘪的妇人，和丈夫同年，长着一对淡蓝眼睛，脸上皱纹之密，褶印之深，还真少见。灰白的头发，依然接她年轻时流行的发型，梳成一络络的小发卷。她穿了件黑衣裙，身上唯一的装饰品是根金链子，上面挂着一枚十字架。她神态羞怯，说起话来柔声细气的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Carey, knowing by what train they were coming, waited in the drawing-room and listened for the click of the gate. When she heard it she went to the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯里太太知道他们会搭乘哪班火车来，所以就在客厅里静心等候，留神着开门的咔哒声。她一听到这声响，立即跑到门口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a little surprised at their conversation. Aunt Louisa told him to come in, and they entered the hall. It was paved with red and yellow tiles, on which alternately were a Greek Cross and the Lamb of God. An imposing staircase led out of the hall. It was of polished pine, with a peculiar smell, and had been put in because fortunately, when the church was reseated, enough wood remained over. The balusters were decorated with emblems of the Four Evangelists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普听了他们的对话不免有点奇怪。路易莎伯母招呼他进屋去，他们一齐走进门厅。门厅里铺着红黄相间的花砖，上面交替印有希腊正十字图案和耶稣基督画像。一道气势不凡的楼梯由厅内通向厅外，它是用磨光发亮的松木做的，散发着一股异香。当年教区教堂装设新座椅时，幸好剩下很多木料，于是就成全了这道楼梯。楼梯栏杆上镌有象征福音书四作者的寓意图案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我已叫人把火炉生好了，我想你们一路风尘仆仆，到家一定会感到冷的”凯里太太说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a large black stove that stood in the hall and was only lighted if the weather was very bad and the Vicar had a cold. It was not lighted if Mrs. Carey had a cold. Coal was expensive. Besides, Mary Ann, the maid, didn't like fires all over the place. If they wanted all them fires they must keep a second girl. In the winter Mr. and Mrs. Carey lived in the dining-room so that one fire should do, and in the summer they could not get out of the habit, so the drawing-room was used only by Mr. Carey on Sunday afternoons for his nap. But every Saturday he had a fire in the study so that he could write his sermon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门厅里有只黑乎乎的大火炉，只有逢到天气十分恶劣，再加上牧师先生伤风不适的日子才用它来取暖。即使凯里太太受凉感冒了，那也舍不得生这个炉子。煤太贵了。再说，女仆玛丽·安也不乐意在屋子里到处生火取暖。要是有个炉子就生个火，那非得再请个女仆不可。冬天，凯里夫妇整天呆在餐室里，这样，只需在那儿生个火炉就行了Z习惯成自然，到了夏天他们照样在那儿饮食起居，凯里先生只是在星期日下午才去客厅睡个午觉。不过每逢星期六，他为了撰写讲道稿，总让人在书房里生个火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aunt Louisa took Philip upstairs and showed him into a tiny bed-room that looked out on the drive. Immediately in front of the window was a large tree, which Philip remembered now because the branches were so low that it was possible to climb quite high up it.</div>

<div class="line_en">On his first visit to the vicarage he had come with his nurse, and Mrs. Carey had had little to do with him. She looked at him now with some uncertainty.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我自己能洗”他回答得挺干脆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She knew nothing about children. After it was settled that Philip should come down to Blackstable, Mrs. Carey had thought much how she should treat him; she was anxious to do her duty; but now he was there she found herself just as shy of him as he was of her. She hoped he would not be noisy and rough, because her husband did not like rough and noisy boys. Mrs. Carey made an excuse to leave Philip alone, but in a moment came back and knocked at the door; she asked him, without coming in, if he could pour out the water himself. Then she went downstairs and rang the bell for tea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对孩子的事一无所知。在决定让菲利普来布莱克斯泰勃之后，凯里太太经常在盘算该如何对待他。她急切地想尽一下作长辈的义务；而现在孩子来了，她却发现自己在菲利普面前，竞像菲利普在自己跟前一样，感到羞怯不安。但愿他不是个老爱大声嚷嚷的野孩子，因为凯里先生不喜欢那样的孩子。凯里太太找了个借口走了，留下菲利普一个人，可是一转眼又跑回来敲门。她没走进房间，只是站在门外问了声他会不会自己倒水，然后便下楼打铃吩咐仆人上茶点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dining-room, large and well-proportioned, had windows on two sides of it, with heavy curtains of red rep; there was a big table in the middle; and at one end an imposing mahogany sideboard with a looking-glass in it. In one corner stood a harmonium. On each side of the fireplace were chairs covered in stamped leather, each with an antimacassar; one had arms and was called the husband, and the other had none and was called the wife. Mrs. Carey never sat in the arm-chair: she said she preferred a chair that was not too comfortable; there was always a lot to do, and if her chair had had arms she might not be so ready to leave it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="餐室宽绰，结构匀称，房间两面都有一排窗户，遮着厚厚实实的大红棱纹平布窗帘。餐室中央搁着张大餐桌，靠墙边立着的带镜红木餐具柜，颇有几分气派。一个角落里放着一架簧风琴。壁炉两边各摆着一张皮靠椅，革面上留有商标压印，椅背上都罩有椅套。其中一张配有扶手，被叫“丈”椅；另一张没有扶手，被称“老”椅。凯里太太从来不坐那张有扶手的安乐椅。她说，她宁可坐不太舒适的椅子；每天有许多家务事要干，要是她的椅于也配上扶手，那她就会一个劲儿坐下去，懒得动弹了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I shall look at them when you come down to tea," said Mrs. Carey.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Carey was making up the fire when Philip came in, and he pointed out to his nephew that there were two pokers. One was large and bright and polished and unused, and was called the Vicar; and the other, which was much smaller and had evidently passed through many fires, was called the Curate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普进来时，凯里先生正在给炉子加煤。他随手指给侄子看两根拨火棒。其中一根又粗又亮，表面很光滑，未曾使用过，他管这根“牧”；另一根要细得多，显然经常是用它来拨弄炉火的，他管这根“副牧”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Carey thought the journey from London to Blackstable very tiring. She seldom travelled herself, for the living was only three hundred a year, and, when her husband wanted a holiday, since there was not money for two, he went by himself. He was very fond of Church Congresses and usually managed to go up to London once a year; and once he had been to Paris for the exhibition, and two or three times to Switzerland. Mary Ann brought in the egg, and they sat down. The chair was much too low for Philip, and for a moment neither Mr. Carey nor his wife knew what to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在凯里太太想来，从伦敦回布莱克斯泰勃，一路上够劳累的。她自己难得出门，因为他们只能靠区区三百镑的年俸度日；每回丈夫要想外出度假，因手头拮据，负担不起两个人的盘缠，最后总是让他一个人去。凯里先生很喜欢出席全国基督教大会，每年总要设法去伦敦一次。他曾上巴黎参观过一次展览会，还到瑞士去旅行过两三回。玛丽·安把鸡蛋端了进来，大家人席就座。菲利普的椅子嫌太低，凯里先生和他太太竟一时不知所措。">查看中文翻译</div>
