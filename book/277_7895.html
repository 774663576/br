<div class="line_en">Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine-forest. It was winter, and a night of bitter cold. The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Terribly cold it certainly was. The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other's noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors. The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls. Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, "Tu-whit! Tu-whoo! Tu-whit! Tu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气的确是冷透了。住在高高杉树上的小松鼠们互相摩擦着鼻子来取暖，野兔们在自己的洞中龟缩着身子，甚至不敢朝外而看上一眼。唯一好像欢喜这种天气的只有大角鸥了。他们的羽毛让白霜冻得硬邦邦的，不过他们并不在意，他们不停地转动着他们那又大又黄的眼睛，隔着林子彼此呼唤着，“吐威特！吐威特！吐威特！吐威特！今天的气候多么好呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow. Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots tell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms. But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个樵夫继续不停地往前赶着路，并起劲地朝自己的手指手上吹热气，脚上笨大的带铁钉的靴子在雪块上踏行着。有一次他们陷进了一个深深的雪坑里去，等他们出来的时候浑身上下白得就跟磨房的磨面师一样，这时石头也是很滑的；有一次他们在坚硬光滑的冰上跌倒了，这冰是沼地上的水结成的，他们身上的柴捆跌落了，他们只好拾起来，重新捆绑好；还有一次他们以为自己迷了路，心中害怕的不得了，因为他们深知雪对那些睡在她怀中的人是很残酷的。不过他们信任那位好心的圣马丁（司旅行之神），他会照顾所有出门的人，于是他们又照来路退回，小心翼翼地迈着脚步，最后他们终于来到了森林的出口处，并看见下面山谷的远处亮着他们所在村庄的灯光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“真是如此，”他的伙伴回答说，“有些人享有的太多了，而另一些人却得到的太少了。不公平已经把世界给瓜分了，除了忧愁之外，没有一件东西是公平分配的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened. There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star. It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheep-fold no more than a stone's throw away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是就在他们相互悲叹各自的不幸生活时，一件奇怪的事情发生了。从天上掉下来一颗非常明亮，非常美丽的星。它经过其它星星的身旁，从天边滑落了下来，他们惊讶地望着它，在他们看来它似乎就落在小羊圈旁边不到一箭之遥的一丛柳树的后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, "Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are? Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而笑过之后，他们又陷入了忧愁，因为他们想起了自己的穷困家境，一位樵夫对另一个人说，“我们为什么要高兴呢，要知道生活是为有钱人准备的，不是为我们这样的穷人？我们还不如冻死在森林中呢，或者让什么野兽抓住我们把我咬死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And one of them ran taster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow. So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds. And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold. But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep.</div>

The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprung from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants. No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for aims. Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest's orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness.</div>
