<div class="line_en">Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion ofthe year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not withouta settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her husband, whohad traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she hadresided every winter in a house in one of the streets near PortmanSquare. Towards this home, she began on the approach of January toturn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and veryunexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and theanimated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gavea grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herselfto be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was theirdetermined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of theyear. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, andrepeated her invitation immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然詹宁斯太太有个习惯，一年中有大量时间住在女儿、朋友家里，但她并非没有自己的固定寓所。她丈夫原来在城里一个不大雅洁的街区做买卖，生意倒也不错。自他去世以后，她每逢冬天一直住在波特曼广场附近的一条街上的一幢房子里。眼看一月行将来临，她不禁又想起了这个家。一天，出乎达什伍德家两位小姐意料之外，她突然邀请她们陪她一起回家去。听到这个邀请，玛丽安的脸色起了变化，那副活灵活现的神气表明她对这个主意并非无动于衷。埃丽诺没有注意到妹妹的表情变化，便即刻代表两人断然谢绝了。她满以为，她说出了她们两人的共同心愿。她提出的理由是，她们决不能在那个时候离开自己的母亲。詹宁斯太太受到拒绝后不禁吃了一惊，当即把刚才的邀请重复说了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have a notion," said Sir John, "that Miss Marianne would not objectto such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is veryhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because MissDashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off fortown, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to MissDashwood about it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you," said Marianne, with warmth:"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would giveme such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother, -- Ifeel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be madeless happy, less comfortable by our absence-Oh! no, nothing shouldtempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我感谢你，太太，真心诚意地感谢你，”玛丽安激动地说道，“我永远感谢你的邀请，若是能接受的话，它会给我带来莫大的幸福＿＿几乎是我能够享受到的最大幸福。可是我母亲，我那最亲切、最慈祥的母亲——我觉得埃丽诺说得有理，万一我们不在，她给搞得不高兴，不愉快＿＿噢！我说什么也不能离开她。这件事不应该勉强，也千万不能勉强。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall be monstrous glad ofMiss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only themore the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable forthem to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talkto one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. But one orthe other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do youthink I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used tillthis winter to have Charlotte with me.

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could sparethem perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and sawto what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by hereagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther directopposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother'sdecision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive anysupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could notapprove of for Marianne, and which on her own account she hadparticular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, hermother would be eager to promote-she could not expect to influence thelatter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she hadnever been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explainthe motive of her own disinclination for going to London. ThatMarianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlookevery inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must bemost wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that objectto her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared towitness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹宁斯太太再次担保说：达什伍德太太完全放得开她俩，埃丽诺现在明白了妹妹的心思，她一心急于同威洛比重新团聚，别的一切几乎都不顾了，于是她不再直接反对这项计划，只说由她母亲去决定。可是她也知道，尽管她不同意玛丽安去城里作客，尽管她自己有特殊理由避而不去，但是她若出面阻拦，却很难得到母亲的支持。玛丽安无论想干什么事，她母亲都会热切地加以成全——她并不指望能说服母亲谨慎从事，因为就在那件事情上，不管她怎么说，母亲仍然相信玛丽安和威洛比已经订婚。再说，她也不敢为她自己不愿去伦敦的动机作辩解。玛丽安虽然过分挑剔，而且她也完全了解詹宁斯太太的那副德行，总是觉得十分讨厌，却要不顾这—切不便，不顾这会给她那脆弱的情感带来多么巨大的痛苦，而硬要去追求一个目标，这就雄辩地充分地证明：这个目标对她何等重要。埃丽诺虽然目睹了这一切，但对她妹妹把这件事看得如此重要，却丝毫没有思想准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have a little plan ofalteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed withoutany inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you SHOULD go totown; I would have every young woman of your condition in lifeacquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will beunder the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness toyou I can have no doubt.

<div class="line_en">Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towardsthe manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty inpersuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolvedwithin herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would golikewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be leftto the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings shouldbe abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of herdomestic hours. To this determination she was the more easilyreconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, wasnot to be in town before February; and that their visit, without anyunreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺见玛丽安对詹宁斯太太的习惯举止表示满不在乎，情不自禁地笑了，因为她以前往往很难说服她对老太太讲点礼貌。她心里打定主意，若是妹妹坚持要去，她也要一同前往，因为她觉得不应该由着玛丽安去自行其是，不应该使想在家里舒适度日的詹宁斯太太还要听任玛丽安随意摆布。这个决心倒是比较好下，因为她记起了露西讲的话：爱德华。费拉斯在二月份以前不会进城，而她们的访问即使不无故缩短，也可以在此之前进行完毕。">查看中文翻译</div>
