I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylortold me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particularfriend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believedit; and I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I cansay is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of myacquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife mayplague his heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you maydepend on it. I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and ifever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has nothad this many a day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with yourpretty face you will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won'tdisturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once andhave done with. The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonightyou know, and that will amuse her."</div>

But "no, she would go down; she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less."Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could, while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her intothe dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though itseffusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, madeher those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which hersister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend sawthat Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to herwhich might make her at all less so. She treated her therefore, withall the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on thelast day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place by thefire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and tobe amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, shecould have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure adisappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and agood fire. As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this wasforced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not tofollow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.</div>

Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, itwon't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. Nowonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don'tsignify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makeslove to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to flyoff from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl isready to have him. Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, lethis house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? Iwarrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matterscame round. But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way ofpleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age."</div>

Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and avery pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a milefrom the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and situp in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriagesthat pass along. Oh! 'tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in thevillage, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced tosend three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer thanyour mother.

<div class="line_en">"Dear Ma'am," replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of thecomplaints for which it was recommended, "how good you are! But I havejust left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I thinknothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give meleave, I will drink the wine myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的太太，”埃丽诺答道，听说这酒可以医治如此截然不同的疾病，不由得微微一笑，“你真是太好啦！但我刚才来的时候，玛丽安已经上床了，差不多都睡着啦。我想，对她最有益的还是睡眠，你要是允许的话，这酒就让我喝了吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his mannerof looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied thathe neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that hewas already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs. Jennings wasnot struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walkedacross the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered --"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当大伙儿用茶的时候，布兰登上校进来了。根据他在室内东张西望寻觅玛丽安的神态，埃丽诺当即断定：他既不期待也不希望见到她，总而言之，他已经晓得了造成她缺席的缘由。詹宁斯太太不是这么想的，因为一见他走进门，她就来到对面埃丽诺主持的茶桌前，悄声说道：“你瞧，上校看样子和以往一样沉重。他还一点不知道呢，快告诉他吧，亲爱的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutesearlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as sheswallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on acolicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healingpowers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herselfas on her sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹宁斯太太虽然悔恨自己没有早来五分钟，可是对这折衷办法倒也满意。埃丽诺咕嘟咕嘟地喝掉大半杯，一面心里在想：虽然这酒对胆酸痛风症的疗效如何目前对她无关紧要，不过它既然能治好失恋的心灵创伤，让她试用与让她妹妹试用岂不同样有意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps, then," he hesitatingly replied, "what I heard this morningmay be-there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible atfirst."</div>

<div class="line_en">He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a lookwhich perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after hersister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后不久，上校拉出一张椅子挨近埃丽诺坐下，然后便问起了玛丽安的情况，他那神气越发使她确信：他已经掌握了确切的消息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Marianne is not well," said she. "She has been indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“玛丽安情况不佳，”埃丽诺说。“她一整天都不舒服，我们劝她睡觉去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think-in short, that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged-but how shall I tell you? If you know italready, as surely you must, I may be spared."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听说有个男子，我有理由认为——简单地说，有个人，我早就知道他订了婚——我怎么跟你说呢？你若是已经知道了，而且你谅必一定是知道的，就用不着我再说啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladieswere waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the otheran account of the intended match, in a voice so little attemptingconcealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The nameof Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught myattention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thingwas now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey-it wasno longer to be a secret-it would take place even within a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing, especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man stillmore: -- as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to CombeMagna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment! -- but it would beimpossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of MissGrey's guardian."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在帕尔美尔街一家文具店里，我到那儿有事。有两个女士正在等马车，其中一个向另一个叙说起这桩计划中的婚事，听声音并不怕别人听到，因此我可以听得一字不漏。首先引起我注意的，是她一再提到威洛比的名字：约翰。威洛比。接着她十分肯定地说：他与格雷小姐的婚事已经最后敲定——不需要再保密了—一甚至不出几周就要办喜事，还具体地谈到了许多准备情况和其他事宜。有一件事我记得尤为清楚，因为它有助于进一步鉴别那个人。婚礼一完结，他们就计划去库姆大厦，也就是威洛比在萨默塞特郡的宅第。真叫我吃惊啊！不过我当时的心情是莫可名状的。我在文具店里呆到她们走，当场一打听，才知道那个藏不住话的是埃利森太太，后来又听人说，那是格雷小姐的保护人的名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness, "Mr. Willoughby'smarriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we DO know it all. This seems to havebeen a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfoldedit to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的意思是说，”埃丽诺故作镇定地应道，“威洛比先生要与格雷小姐结婚？是的，这我们确实知道。今天似乎是个真相大白的日子，因为直到今天上午我们才知道这件事。威洛比先生真是令人莫测高深！你是在哪几听说的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable-at least I think" -- he stoppeda moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, "Andyour sister-how did she --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这有可能，不过威洛比可能——至少我认为——”上校略停了片刻，然后用一种似乎缺乏自信的语气补充说，“且说你妹妹——她怎么—”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Her sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that theymay be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruelaffliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now, perhaps-but I am almost convinced that he never wasreally attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in somepoints, there seems a hardness of heart about him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她非常痛苦。我只能希望痛苦的时间相对短一些。她一直到现在，悲痛极了。我想直到昨天，她还从未怀疑过威洛比的情意。甚至现在，也许——不过，我倒几乎确信，他从未真正爱过她。他一向很不老实！从某些事情上看，他似乎心肠挺冷酷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would stilljustify him if she could."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你了解她的脾气，尽可相信：要是可能的话，她现在还急着替威洛比辩护呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousandpounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation."</div>

<div class="line_en">He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of thetea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject wasnecessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasurewhile they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of MissDashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on ColonelBrandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, ofhope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole eveningmore serious and thoughtful than usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上校没有应声。过不一会儿，茶盏端走了，牌桌安排妥当，人们必然也就不再谈论这个话题。詹宁斯太太本来一直在兴致勃勃地瞅着他们两个谈话，心想只要达什伍德小姐一露口风，布兰登上校马上就会笑逐颜开，就如同一个人进入青年时期，充满了希望和幸福一祥。不料她惊奇地发现：上校整个晚上比往常还要不苟言笑，心事重重。">查看中文翻译</div>
