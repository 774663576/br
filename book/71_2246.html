<div class="line_en">Edmond went down, lifted the rock, filled his pockets with precious stones and replaced the boards and the iron bindings of the casket as best he could; then he covered it with earth, which he trampled down and scattered with sand, to make the newly turned soil look similar to the rest. He went out of the cave, replaced the entrance, piled stones of various sizes around it, put earth into the gaps, planted myrtle and heather in them, and watered these new plants to make them seem well established. Finally, he covered the traces of his footprints around the spot and waited impatiently for the return of his companions. There was no sense now in spending his time looking at this gold and these diamonds, and staying on Monte Cristo like a dragon guarding a useless treasure: he must return to life and take his place among men and in society, with the rank, influence and power that are bestowed in this world by wealth -- that first and greatest of forces that a human being can control.</div>

<div class="line_en">The smugglers returned on the sixth day. From afar, Dantès recognized the Jeune-Amélie by its cut and its gait: it was limping into port like a wounded Philoctetes. When his companions stepped ashore, Dantès told them that he was considerably better, though he continued to complain. Then in turn he listened to the smugglers' tales. They had certainly been successful, but hardly had the cargo been off-loaded than they learned that a brig of the excise from Toulon had just left harbour and was heading in their direction. They took flight at once, regretting that Dantès, who knew how to get so much greater speed out of the vessel, was not there to guide them. The following boat soon came into view, but they managed to escape under cover of night and by rounding the Cap Corse. In short, the voyage had not been unsuccessful and everyone, particularly Jacopo, expressed regret that Dantès had not been with them, so that he could have his share of the profits they had brought back, a share which amounted to fifty piastres.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmond remained impassive. He did not even smile when they emphasized how much he would have benefited by leaving the island; and, since the Jeune-Amélie had called at Monte Cristo only to pick him up, he embarked the same evening and went with the boat to Leghorn. There he went to visit a Jew and sold four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs apiece. The Jew might have enquired how a mere seaman came into possession of such things, but he was careful not to ask; he was making a thousand francs on each diamond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙依旧不动神色，——甚至想到他只要能离开这个小岛就可以收到多大的利益时，也不露一丝微笑。但宙纳·阿米里号到基督山来也是为了来接他的，他当晚上船，就和船长一同继续向里窝那前进。到了里窝那，他走到一个做珠宝商的犹太人家里，拿出他的四颗最小的钻石来，每颗卖了五千法郎。邓蒂斯恐怕这样值钱的珠宝在象他这样穷苦的水手手里或许会引起怀疑，但那机智的购买者对于这笔他至少可以赚到四千法郎的交易却并没有提出惹人讨厌的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it was Jacopo's turn to think he was dreaming. Edmond told him that he had become a sailor on an impulse, because his family would not give him money to support himself; but that on arriving in Leghorn he had received a bequest from an uncle who had made him his sole heir. This story seemed plausible enough, in view of Dantès' superior upbringing, and Jacopo did not for a moment doubt that his former comrade had told him the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次可轮到贾可布以为他自己在做梦了。邓蒂斯告诉他，他之所以当了一名水手，只是为了他的怪癖，并想和他的朋友们赌一口气，因为他们不许他称心如意的花钱。但这次到里窝那，他得了一笔很大的财产，是他的一位叔父遗赠给他的，他原是他叔父的惟一继承人。邓蒂斯所表现的优良的教养使这一番话听来极其可信，所以贾可布丝毫没有怀疑到它的真实性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day Dantès bought a new boat which he gave to Jacopo, together with a hundred piastres so that he could engage a crew, all on condition that Jacopo went to Marseille and asked for news of an old man called Louis Dantès, living in the Allées de Meilhan, and a young woman from the Catalan village, named Mercédès.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，邓蒂斯赠了一艘全新的帆船给贾可布，附带送他一笔一百毕阿士特的礼，使他可以雇一批合适的船员和购办其他必要的配备，——只是有一个条件，就是他应该即刻到马赛去，去探问一个名叫路易士·邓蒂斯，住在米兰巷的老人，和一个住在迦太兰村，名叫美茜蒂丝的青年女人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He arrived at the moment when they were testing a little yacht ordered by an Englishman who, having heard it said that the Genoese were the best boat-builders in the Mediterranean, had decided to have a yacht built there. He had settled on a price of forty thousand francs; Dantès offered sixty, on condition that the boat was delivered to him that same day. The Englishman had gone on a trip to Switzerland while the boat was being completed. He was not due to return for three weeks or a month, so the boat-builder reckoned he would have time to start building another. Dantès took him to a Jewish banker, who led them behind his shop and counted out sixty thousand francs for the boat-builder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他到达的时候，一艘小游艇正在港湾里试航。这艘小游艇是一个英国人定制的，他因为听说热那亚人制造快航帆船比地中海沿岸其他的造船商都高明，所以很希望得到一个能证明他们的技巧的标本。英国人和热那亚船商讲定的价钱是四万法郎。邓蒂斯肯出六万法郎买它，只是必须立刻要把船交给他。定造这艘游艇的那个人已到瑞士去旅行，三四个星期之内大概不会回来，在这期间，船商算来已可另外造成一艘。所以这笔交易就成功了。邓蒂斯领着船商到一个犹太人的家里，和犹太人到一间很狭小的后客厅里去单独谈了几分钟，回来的时候，犹太人就数了六万法郎给造船商。">查看中文翻译</div>

He gave the measurements for the compartments, and they were completed by the following day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="造船商于是自愿效劳给那艘小帆船供给一批船员，但这一点邓蒂斯婉言谢绝了。他说他是惯于独自巡游的，他主要的兴趣是在于亲自驾驶他的游艇。他惟一的希望是造船商能在他船舱的床头设计安装一个秘密柜，柜里要有三个暗格。他说了这些暗格的尺寸，第二天就做好了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="看客们观望着这艘小帆船，直到它走出了他们的视线，然后他们转过身来，纷纷猜测它可能去的目的地。有些人坚持说它是到科西嘉去的，有些人则坚持说是爱尔巴岛。有些人打赌说它一定到西班牙去，而有些人则固执地以为它是到非洲去的。但谁都没有想到基督山。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He succeeded brilliantly: with the help of the rudder, and without needing to leave it, he put his boat through its paces, so that it seemed like an intelligent being, ready to obey the slightest command.

Finally he went across to the door, stepped inside and asked if there was no lodging vacant. Even though it was occupied, he insisted on going to visit the one on the fifth floor, until finally the concierge agreed to go up and ask the people living in it whether a stranger could take a look at their two rooms. The little lodging was inhabited by a young man and woman who had been married only a week. When he saw this young couple, Dantès gave a deep sigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯靠在一棵树上，对那座可怜的小房子凝视了许多时候，然后他走到门口，问这座屋子有没有房间出租。虽然得到了否定的答复，他还是热切地恳求允许他去看一看六层楼上的那些房间，看门人就上去问那两个房间的住客，允不允许让一个陌生人来看看。房客是一对刚在一星期以前结婚的青年夫妇，邓蒂斯一看见他们，就发出一声长叹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As it happened, there was nothing to remind Dantès of his father's apartment. The wallpaper had changed and all the old furniture, Edmond's childhood friends, which he recalled in every detail, had disappeared. Only the walls were the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一层楼一共只有这两个小房间，房间里没有一样东西是老邓蒂斯那个时代所留下来的，连糊墙纸都已与前不同。旧时的家具，在他的童年时代是这样的熟悉，一桌一椅都深深地刻在他的记忆里，现在却都不见了，只有四面的墙壁依然故我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Reaching the floor below, Edmond paused in front of another door and asked if the tailor, Caderousse, lived there. But the concierge told him that the person he mentioned had failed in business and now kept a little inn on the Bellegarde road in Beaucaire.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young couple looked in astonishment at this stern-faced man down whose otherwise impassive cheeks two large tears were falling. But as every sorrow inspires some awe, they did not question the stranger, but stepped back to let him weep at his ease. When he left, they went with him to the door and told him that he could come back whenever he wished: there would always be a welcome in their humble abode.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès went down to the street, asked for the address of the owner of the house in the Allées de Meilhan, went to visit him and was announced as Lord Wilmore -- which was the name and title on his passport. He bought the house for twenty-five thousand francs, which was at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but if it had stood at half a million, Dantès would have bought it for that.</div>
