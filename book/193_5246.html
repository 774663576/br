In her place stood an old man with rotting teeth. The man stared down, curling his lips into a lonely grimace. Then he let out a scream of anguish that resounded across the desert.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「我道歉。我有东西必须让你看，这件事不能在电话裡讨论。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A knowing groan escaped Langdon's lips. This had happened before. One of the perils of writing books about religious symbology was the calls from religious zealots who wanted him to confirm their latest sign from God. Last month a stripper from Oklahoma had promised Langdon the best sex of his life if he would fly down and verify the authenticity of a cruciform that had magically appeared on her bed sheets. The Shroud of Tulsa, Langdon had called it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登明白了，不禁冒出一声呻吟。这种事情以前也发生过。写有关宗教符号学的书，风险之一就是会接到宗教狂热者打来的电话，想请他帮忙确认他们最近遇到的上帝显灵讯息。上个月一个奥克拉荷马州陶萨市的脱衣舞孃就打过电话来，保证要给兰登毕生最棒的性经验，只要他肯飞过去证实她床单上所神奇出现的十字架确实是神蹟。陶萨圣殓布，兰登如此称之。（译注：现存义大利杜林主教堂的「杜林圣殓布」，布上浮现著模糊的受钉者全身肖像，相传当初曾包裹过耶稣的尸身。一译「杜林裹尸布」。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not going anywhere! It's five o'clock in the morning!" Langdon hung up and collapsed back in bed. He closed his eyes and tried to fall back asleep. It was no use. The dream was emblazoned in his mind. Reluctantly, he put on his robe and went downstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我哪儿都不去！现在是清晨五点！」兰登挂上电话，倒回床上。他闭上眼睛想继续睡觉。可是没用。那个梦境深深印在他脑海中。他只好心不甘情不愿地穿了睡袍下楼去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Robert Langdon wandered barefoot through his deserted Massachusetts Victorian home and nursed his ritual insomnia remedy -- a mug of steaming Nestlé's Quik. The April moon filtered through the bay windows and played on the oriental carpets. Langdon's colleagues often joked that his place looked more like an anthropology museum than a home. His shelves were packed with religious artifacts from around the world -- anekuaba from Ghana, a gold cross from Spain, a cycladic idol from the Aegean, and even a rare wovenboccus from Borneo, a young warrior's symbol of perpetual youth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗柏．兰登赤足在他位于麻州那栋维多利亚风格的家中徘徊，啜著他平常治疗失眠症的偏方──一杯冒著热气的雀巢即溶巧克力。四月天的月光透入凸窗，在东方地毯上嬉戏。兰登的同事常开玩笑说他住处看起来不太像个家，倒还比较像人类学博物馆。他的架子上塞满了来自世界各地的宗教手工艺品──迦纳的艾库巴像、西班牙的金十字架、爱琴海地区基克拉泽斯群岛的偶像，甚至还有一件罕见的婆罗洲巴库斯编织品，是年轻战士青春常在的象徵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Langdon sat on his brass Maharishi's chest and savored the warmth of the chocolate, the bay window caught his reflection. The image was distorted and pale… like a ghost. An aging ghost, he thought, cruelly reminded that his youthful spirit was living in a mortal shell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登坐在他黄铜的摩诃利希矮柜上，品嚐著巧克力的暖意，凸窗上映著他的影像，裡头的那张脸扭曲而苍白……像个鬼。老去的鬼，他心想，残忍地提醒自己，这个年轻的灵魂住在一具终将衰亡的躯壳中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon's friends had always viewed him as a bit of an enigma -- a man caught between centuries. On weekends he could be seen lounging on the quad in blue jeans, discussing computer graphics or religious history with students; other times he could be spotted in his Harris tweed and paisley vest, photographed in the pages of upscale art magazines at museum openings where he had been asked to lecture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登的朋友总认为他有点像个谜──是同时跨越两个世纪的人。週末时会看到他套著蓝色牛仔裤，在校舍间的方庭漫步，跟学生讨论电脑绘图或宗教史；其他时候则可以看到他身穿哈里斯毛料西装和涡状花纹背心，出现在高档艺术杂志中，应邀在博物馆开幕会演讲的照片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although not overly handsome in a classical sense, the forty-five-year-old Langdon had what his female colleagues referred to as an "erudite" appeal -- wisps of gray in his thick brown hair, probing blue eyes, an arrestingly deep voice, and the strong, carefree smile of a collegiate athlete. A varsity diver in prep school and college, Langdon still had the body of a swimmer, a toned, six-foot physique that he vigilantly maintained with fifty laps a day in the university pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儘管四十岁的兰登并不是特别俊美，却拥有女同事们所谓的「书卷气」外型──浓密的褐色头髮夹著几茎灰丝，锐利的蓝色双眼，迷人的低沉嗓音，还有大学运动健将那种健康而轻鬆愉快的笑容。兰登曾经是预校和大学裡的跳水校队，至今依然拥有泳者的矫健身手，身高六呎的他，小心翼翼地保持著健壮的体格，每天要在学校的泳池裡游五十趟来回。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although a tough teacher and strict disciplinarian, Langdon was the first to embrace what he hailed as the "lost art of good clean fun." He relished recreation with an infectious fanaticism that had earned him a fraternal acceptance among his students. His campus nickname -- "The Dolphin" -- was a reference both to his affable nature and his legendary ability to dive into a pool and outmaneuver the entire opposing squad in a water polo match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儘管兰登教学严格、一丝不苟，但他是拥抱所谓「失传乾淨的好游戏」的始作俑者。他热中娱乐，狂热而具有感染力，使得学生有如兄弟般接纳他。他在校园裡的绰号──「海豚」──便源于他友善可亲的个性，还有他在水球比赛中潜入泳池、出奇制胜的传奇本事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The image on the page was that of a human corpse. The body had been stripped naked, and its head had been twisted, facing completely backward. On the victim's chest was a terrible burn. The man had been branded… imprinted with a single word. It was a word Langdon knew well. Very well. He stared at the ornate lettering in disbelief.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Langdon sat alone, absently gazing into the darkness, the silence of his home was shattered again, this time by the ring of his fax machine. Too exhausted to be annoyed, Langdon forced a tired chuckle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当兰登独自静坐，心不在焉地凝视著一片黑暗，他家中的沉寂再度被打破，这回是传真机的铃声。兰登累得根本不想理会了，勉强挤出了一声疲倦的低笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
