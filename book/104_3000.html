<div class="line_en">One might suppose that with all blocks removed and a prospect of delirious and unlimited delights before me, I would have mentally sunk back, heaving a sigh of delicious relief. Eh bien, pas du tout! Instead of basking in the beams of smiling Chance, I was obsessed by all sorts of purely ethical doubts and fears. For instance: might it not surprise people that Lo was so consistently debarred from attending festive and funeral functions in her immediate family? You remember -- we had not had her at our wedding. Or another thing: granted it was the long hairy arm of Coincidence that had reached out to remove an innocent woman, might Coincidence not ignore in a heathen moment what its twin limb had done and hand Lo a premature note of commiseration? True, the accident had been reported only by the Ramsdale Journal -- not by the Parkington Recorder or the Climax Herald, Camp Q being in another state, and local deaths having no federal news interest; but I could not help fancying that somehow Dolly Haze had been informed already, and that at the very time I was on my way to fetch her, she was being driven to Ramsdale by friends unknown to me. Still more disquieting than all these conjectures and worries, was the fact that Humbert Humbert, a brand-new American citizen of obscure European origin, had taken no steps toward becoming the legal guardian of his dead wife's daughter (twelve years and seven months old). Would I ever dare take those steps? I could not repress a shiver whenever I imagined my nudity hemmed in by mysterious statutes in the merciless glare of the Common Law.</div>

<div class="line_en">My scheme was a marvel of primitive art: I would whizz over to Camp Q, tell Lolita her mother was about to undergo a major operation at an invented hospital, and then keep moving with my sleepy nymphet from inn to inn while her mother got better and better and finally died. But as I traveled campward my anxiety grew. I could not bear to think I might not find Lolita there -- or find, instead, another, scared, Lolita clamoring for some family friend: not the Farlows, thank God -- she hardly knew them -- but might there not be other people I had not reckoned with? Finally, I decided to make the long-distance call I had simulated so well a few days before. It was raining hard when I pulled up in a muddy suburb of Parkington, just before the Fork, one prong of which bypassed the city and led to the highway which crossed the hills to Lake Climax and Camp Q. I flipped off the ignition and for quite a minute sat in the car bracing myself for that telephone call, and staring at the rain, at the inundated sidewalk, at a hydrant: a hideous thing, really, painted a thick silver and red, extending the red stumps of its arms to be varnished by the rain which like stylized blood dripped upon its argent chains. No wonder that stopping beside those nightmare cripples is taboo. I drove up to a gasoline station. A surprise awaited me when at last the coins had satisfactorily clanked down and a voice was allowed to answer mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的计划是原始艺术的一件奇物：我要风驰电掣开车向Q营地去，告诉洛她母亲要去一家我虚构的医院经受一次大手术，然后偕同我的困倦的性感宝贝流连于各家旅馆，而她母亲的病情则日有好转，但最后还是不幸去世。在我朝营地驰去时，我的焦虑不断增长。我不堪想象，我可能在那儿找不到洛丽塔—或找到的是，另一个、惊恐的洛丽塔正向一些亲友大喊求助：不是法洛夫妇，感谢上帝—她还不认识他们—但难道不会是其他一些我想不到的人吗？最后，我决定打个长途电话，就是几天前我着意模拟过的。雨下得很大，我在帕金顿泥泞的郊外一条岔路前停下车，这条路绕过城市汇入高速公路，这公路穿过山地便直通克里迈克斯湖和Q营地。我轻轻关上发火，整整一分钟坐在车里振作精神，准备打那个电话。眼睛凝望着雨水，凝望着淹没了的便道，凝望着一只消火栓：一个蠢东西，真的，涂着厚厚的银漆和红漆，伸出它两只红色犄角让雨水浸淹，雨象奇特的血滴落在它银白的锁链上。毫无疑问，停在这些梦魇般的跛足者旁边是忌讳的。我于是驱车进到一家加油站。当硬币终于叮当当满意地落下去，并有个声音回答了我时，一场吃惊正等待我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What next? I proceeded to the business center of Parkington and devoted the whole afternoon (the weather had cleared, the wet town was like silver-and-glass) to buying beautiful things for Lo. Goodness, what crazy purchases were prompted by the poignant predilection Humbert had in those days for check weaves, bright cottons, frills, puffed-out short sleeves, soft pleats, snug-fitting bodices and generously full skirts! Oh Lolita, you are my girl, as Vee was Poe's and Bea Dante's, and what little girl would not like to whirl in a circular skirt and scanties? Did I have something special in mind? coaxing voices asked me. Swimming suits? We have them in all shades. Dream pink, frosted aqua, glans mauve, tulip red, oolala black. What about playsuits? Slips? No slips. Lo and I loathed slips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一步呢？我继续驰回帕金顿的商业中心，整个下午（天气晴朗了，湿润的城市如银似镜）全花在为洛选购漂亮衣物上。上帝，被强烈的偏好所激励的是什么样疯狂的购买啊，亨伯特这几天就有这种偏好，棋盘格花布，明艳的棉布，衣饰的花绢边，泡泡短袖，软褶，舒服合体的紧身胸衣和宽大的裙子！噢，洛丽塔，你是我的女孩儿，就象维是坡的，贝是但丁的，哪个小女孩不喜欢穿一件圆裙子或超短裤旋转呢？我心里还想买什么特别的东西吗？娇媚的声音问着我。泳衣吗？我们有各种颜色的。梦似的粉红、如霜的白色，槲果之淡紫色，郁金香红色、噢啦啦居然还有墨玉之色。演出服怎么样？套裙？不要套裙。洛与我都讨厌套裙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Holmes, the camp mistress, informed me that Dolly had gone Monday (this was Wednesday) on a hike in the hills with her group and was expected to return rather late today. Would I care to come tomorrow, and what was exactly -- Without going into details, I said that her mother was hospitalized, that the situation was grave, that the child should not be told it was grave and that she should be ready to leave with me tomorrow afternoon. The two voices parted in an explosion of warmth and good will, and through some freak mechanical flaw all my coins came tumbling back to me with a hitting-the-jackpot clatter that almost made me laugh despite the disappointment at having to postpone bliss. One wonders if this sudden discharge, this spasmodic refund, was not correlated somehow, in the mind of McFate, with my having invented that little expedition before ever learning of it as I did now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍姆斯女士，营地女主人，对我说多丽星期一就走了（今天是星期三）随她的小组登山行军去了，今天很晚才可能回来。我是不是最好明天来，到底怎么了—我没详细说什么，只说她母亲住院了，情况很糟，但别告诉孩子情况很糟，让她做好准备明天下午跟我离开。两个声音在温暖而真诚的祝愿中分别了，我的所有硬币因为什么奇异的机械失灵以好运突至的僻哩啪啦声又跌还给我，尽管我由于不得不推迟天赐的福祉而感到失望，但这几乎逗我笑了。人们可能会想，在我根本没听说之前，就发明创造了那支小探险队，那么，这些突然流出来的东西，这个间歇发作的退款，在命运先生的脑中，是不是正与此有关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Apart from measurements, I could of course visualize Lolita with hallucinational lucidity; and nursing as I did a tingle on my breastbone at the exact spot her silky top had come level once or twice with my heart; and feeling as I did her warm weight in my lap (so that, in a sense, I was always "with Lolita" as a woman is "with child"), I was not surprised to discover later that my computation had been more or less correct. Having moreover studied a midsummer sale book, it was with a very knowing air that I examined various pretty articles, sport shoes, sneakers, pumps of crushed kid for crushed kids. The painted girl in black who attended to all these poignant needs of mine turned parental scholarship and precise description into commercial euphemisms, such as "petite," Another, much older woman, in a white dress, with a pancake make-up, seemed to be oddly impressed by my knowledge of junior fashions; perhaps I had a midget for mistress; so, when shown a skirt with two "cute" pockets in front, I intentionally put a naive male question and was rewarded by a smiling demonstration of the way the zipper worked in the back of the skirt. I had next great fun with all kinds of shorts and briefs -- phantom little Lolitas dancing, falling, daisying all over the counter. We rounded up the deal with some prim cotton pajamas in popular butcher-boy style. Humbert, the popular butcher.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开这些测量记录，我当然也能凭幻觉的光辉想象出格丽塔；我抚摸着我胸骨上的一块刺痛，那就是她披着秀发的头曾有一两次靠住我的心房的地方；我还能感觉着她在我膝上温热的肉体之重（这样，就某种意识而言，我便总是“和洛丽塔在—起”就象孕妇“和胎儿在一起”），后来发现我的计算差不多都正确，倒也毫不为怪。何况我还多研究了一本仲夏购物薄，因此我能带着一副颇为谙事的神态，流览各种各样的漂亮货，运动鞋，胶底鞋，为压碎的小山羊制做的压碎的小出羊皮轻便舞鞋。为我这些苛刻要求服务的一位化着妆、穿黑衣的小组，将作父母的学识和精细的描述转化成商业婉辞，比如“小了”。另一位年龄稍大、穿一身白衣裙，画着水粉饼妆的妇女，好象我对儿童时装如此精通竟今其感动了；因此，当拿给她一件前身有两个“可爱的”兜兜的裙子的时，我就故意问了一个天真的男性问题，得到的奖励是满带笑容的示范表演，表演裙子后背那条拉锁的开关方式。其次我对各种短小又简单的衣物有巨大兴趣—虚幻中的小洛丽塔们在跳舞、降落、全围在柜台边蹦蹦跳跳，吱吱喳喳。这场选购最后是以几套小屠夫式样的素净的棉布睡衣结束的。亨伯特，时髦的屠夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of my guides in these matters was an anthropometric entry made by her mother on Lo's twelfth birthday (the reader remembers that Know-Your-Child book). I had the feeling that Charlotte, moved by obscure motives of envy and dislike, had added an inch here, a pound there; but since the nymphet had no doubt grown somewhat in the last seven months, I thought I could safely accept most of those January measurements: hip girth, twenty-nine inches; thigh girth (just below the gluteal sulcus), seventeen; calf girth and neck circumference, eleven; chest circumference, twenty-seven; upper arm girth, eight; waist, twenty-three; stature, fifty-seven inches; weight, seventy-eight pounds; figure, linear; intelligence quotient, 121; vermiform appendix present, thank God.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow, in connection with that quiet poetical afternoon of fastidious shopping, I recalled the hotel or inn with the seductive name of The Enchanted Hunters which Charlotte had happened to mention shortly before my liberation. With the help of a guidebook I located it in the secluded town of Briceland, a four-hour drive from Lo's camp. I could have telephoned but fearing my voice might go out of control and lapse into coy croaks of broken English, I decided to send a wire ordering a room with twin beds for the next night. What a comic, clumsy, wavering Prince Charming I was! How some of my readers will laugh at me when I tell them the trouble I had with the wording of my telegram! What should I put: Humbert and daughter? Humberg and small daughter? Homberg and immature girl? Homburg and child? The droll mistake -- the "g" at the end -- which eventually came through may have been a telepathic echo of these hesitations of mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，和这个静谧的、富有诗意的、吹毛求疵的购物下午有关的，是我想起了有个诱人的名字“着魔猎人”旅馆或旅店，夏洛特在我获得解放的前不久偶然提起过。靠了一本指南的帮助，我找到它的位置在隐秘的布赖斯地，从洛的营地开车需四小时。按说我可以打电话去，但又怕自己的声音失去控制，结结巴巴象是害羞的洋经浜英语，于是决定发一封电报订一间明天晚上的双人房。我是一个多么富有喜剧性、忧郁又摇摆不定的快乐王子啊！如果我告诉我的读者我在发报时碰到的措词麻烦，他们有些人会怎样笑话我！我该怎么写：亨伯特及女儿？亨伯格与小女儿？亨伯格与未成年姑娘？亨伯格与孩子？那个有趣的错误—结尾是“格”—最终还是成功了，或许还是我的这些犹豫的心灵感应回音呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is a touch of the mythological and the enchanted in those large stores where according to ads a career girl can get a complete desk-to-date wardrobe, and where little sister can dream of the day when her wool jersey will make the boys in the back row of the classroom drool. Lifesize plastic figures of snubbed-nosed children with dun-colored, greenish, brown-dotted, faunish faces floated around me. I realized I was the only shopper in that rather eerie place where I moved about fishlike, in a glaucous aquarium. I sensed strange thoughts form in the minds of the languid ladies that escorted me from counter to counter, from rock ledge to seaweed, and the belts and the bracelets I chose seemed to fall from siren hands into transparent water. I bought an elegant valise, had my purchases put into it, and repaired to the nearest hotel, well pleased with my day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那些大商店里，有一种神话般令人迷魂的气氛，根据广告所说，一个职业女子可以买到全身时髦的工作套服，小姐妹可以梦想有一天，她穿上羊毛紧身衫能让教室后排的男孩垂涎三尺。象真人那么大的狮子鼻儿童塑料模型，暗褐色，绿色、棕色带点、农牧神似的脸飘浮在我的身边。我发现我是那家阴森恐怖的商店里唯一的顾客，象条鱼走动在淡蓝绿色的水族馆里。我感觉到那些萎靡的店员脑中奇异的思绪，它们正护卫我从一个柜台移向另一个柜台，从岩石边移向海草，而我挑选的腰带和手镯也仿佛从海上女妖的手里落入透明的水中。我买了一只香味手提箱，把我买好的衣物装进去，然后去了一家最近的旅店，为这一天感到欣慰满意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, in the velvet of a summer night, my broodings over the philter I had with me! Oh miserly Hamburg! Was he not a very Enchanted Hunter as he deliberated with himself over his boxful of magic ammunition? To rout the monster of insomnia should he try himself one of those amethyst capsules? There were forty of them, all told -- forty nights with a frail little sleeper at my throbbing side; could I rob myself of one such night in order to sleep? Certainly not: much too precious was each tiny plum, each microscopic planetarium with its live Stardust. Oh, let me be mawkish for the nonce! I am so tired of being cynical.</div>
