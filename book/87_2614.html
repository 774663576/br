<div class="line_en">Barry appeared on the other side of the giant staircase, shaking his head and walking slowly to join her. Jill bit her lower lip, frowning.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“威斯克会不会遇到了那些…怪物中的一个？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill walked to the stairs, feeling almost dizzy. First Chris, now the captain. They hadn't been gone five minutes and he'd said he was going to stay put. Why would he have left? She looked around for signs of a struggle, a spent cartridge, a spot of blood -- there was nothing to indicate what might have happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔慢慢走向楼梯，她感到有些头晕。开始是克里斯、现在又是队长。自己和巴瑞离开这里还不到五分钟，队长也说过要在这里等他们回来。为什么又不见了呢？吉尔环顾四周，试图寻找是否有打斗的痕迹，可是却没有找到任何能够说明这里发生了什么事情的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="两个人站在原地，思考着究竟发生了什么事情。吉尔想到刚才遇到的那具会行走的尸体，此刻还是有些害怕。可是从另一个角度上来讲，事实的确如此，吉尔也能够很好地接受当前的事态。浣熊市边境的森林地带，理在已经变成了丧尸横行的地区。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow it wasn't, and neither were the murderous dogs or the secretly kept estate. There was no question that it all existed. The question was, why? Did the mansion have anything to do with the murders, or had the zombies simply overrun it like they'd overrun Raccoon Forest?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，根本不会有那种事情。提到杀人恶狗、被秘密所包围的别墅，还可以理解。大家对于实际存在的东西没有太多怀疑的余地。吉尔不明白的是这些事情发生的原因，这间别墅与一连串的杀人案件之间有关系吗？还有这些丧尸仅仅是占领了这间别墅而已吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a lifetime of reading trashy novels about serial killers, is a cannibal zombie so hard to swallow?</div>

<div class="line_en">He half-smiled, though Jill could see the worry in his eyes. "Chris and Wesker got-side-tracked, but we'll find them. It'd take more than a couple of walking stiffs to cause either of them any grief."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞勉强挤出一个笑容，可是吉尔从他的眼神中读出了担心的神色。“克里斯与威斯克只是跟咱们走散了而已，会找到他们的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill nodded, tucking the lockpicks into her hip pouch. Barry had taken an interest in her former "career" and she'd given him a few pieces from her old set, several picks and torsion bars. They could come in handy. The small bundle settled on top of something hard and smooth -- Trent's computer! In all the excitement, she'd totally forgotten about her strange encounter in the locker room. She opened her mouth to tell Barry, then shut it, remembering Trent's cryptic warning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔—边点头一边将这些开锁工具放进腰包里。因为巴瑞一直都很关心吉尔之前的“经历”，所以她从曾经使用过的“做买卖用的道具”中挑选出了两三根扭杆交给了巴瑞。这些细细的金属棒在滑落腰包时还撞击到了某些坚硬的东西…那是从特兰特那里拿到的微型电脑！由于紧张，自己早就将那次奇怪的邂逅完全给忘记了。虽然吉尔想要把这件事告诉巴瑞，可最终还是没有那么做，因为特兰特最后的那句神秘的警告再次出现在吉尔的耳旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill realized what she was thinking and had to fight off an urge to laugh at herself. What had happened with Trent probably wasn't even relevant to their predicament, and whether or not she could trust Barry, she knew she didn't trust Trent -- still, she decided not to say anything about it, at least until she had a chance to see what the computer held.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔沉浸在自己的思考中，特兰特大概与自己现在深陷险境没有任何关系，暂且不论巴瑞是否值得信赖，难道那个特兰特就能够信任吗？所以关于特兰特的事情还是继续隐瞒下去吧。但是至少自己要找机会看一下徽型电脑里面文件的内容才行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing left to say. Jill headed straight for the set of doors on the west wall that Wesker hadn't tried earlier. Behind her, Barry hurried back to the dining room. She heard the door open and close, leaving her alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二人开始分头行动，吉尔径直走向大厅的西侧，前面就是威斯克没能打开的那扇门。在她的身后，巴瑞已经快速地回到了餐厅。能够听到他开门、关门的声音，大厅里只剩下吉尔一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The painted blue doors opened smoothly, revealing a small, shadowy room as cool and silent as the main hall, all in shades of blue. Muted track lighting illuminated framed paintings on dusky walls, and in the center of the room was a large statue of a woman holding an urn on one shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="被涂成绿色的门很顺利地就被打开，一间与大厅一样凉爽而又安静的小房间出现在吉尔的眼前。好像整个房间都被绿色所覆盖的感觉。在房间的正中央，放着一尊巨大的女性雕像，那名女性的肩膀上扛着—个水壶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill closed the door behind her and let her eyes adjust to the gloom, noting the two doors opposite the one she'd come through. The one on the left was open, though a small chest was pushed in front of it, blocking access. It was unlikely that Wesker had gone that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔关上门，眼睛在逐渐地适应阴暗，她发现在自己进来的这扇门的对面还有两扇门。左侧的门敞开着，但是有一个小小的衣柜放在门口那里，好像为了防止别人进来。威斯克大概是朝着那边走了…">查看中文翻译</div>

A screen the size of a baseball card flickered to life, and with a few more taps, small lines of type scrolled across the monitor.

Trent had apparently compiled every article he could find about the murders and disappearances in Raccoon, plus the pieces on the S. T. A. R. S.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a plain-looking door to his left. Chris pulled at the knob, but it was locked. He squinted at the key plate, and wasn't all that surprised to see an etching of what looked like armor. Sword, armor-there was a definite theme developing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hall turned to the left and he took the corner fast, sweeping the Beretta across the wide wooden expanse.

<div class="line_en">Chris quickly edged to the right, trying to get a clear shot. The zombie was maybe forty feet away, and he didn't want to waste his last rounds.
