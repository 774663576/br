<div class="line_en">As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She became alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed natural to leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes. The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at a different railway station. "Never go home the same way as you went out," she said, as though enunciating an important general principle. She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her.</div>

It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing -- thread. If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition.

I've got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out leaflets, or something. Isn't it bloody? Give me a brush-down, would you? Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you sure?

<div class="line_en">She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or her address. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她扑到他怀里，猛烈地吻他，一会儿后，她穿过那些小树，悄无声息地消失在树林中。甚至现在，他还是不知道她的姓或她的住址。然而，这无关紧要，因为难以想象他们会在家里见面或有什么通信联系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood. During the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love. That was in another hiding-place known to Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. In the street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. As they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without introduction on the following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation, which she called "talking by instalments". She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were white. She was dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然不出所料，他们再也没有回到树林中的那块空地去。在整个五月，他们只在另一个场合成功地做爱。那是朱丽亚知道的另一个藏身处，在已成废墟的一座教堂的钟楼上，教堂周围是一片荒野，三十年前，那儿遭到一颗原子弹的轰炸。你如果能走到那里，那是一个不错的藏身处，但路上很危险。除此之外，他们只能在街头上见面，每个晚上见面的地方都不同，没有一次超过半小时。在街上通常可以说上话，但很勉强。他们从拥挤的人行道上走开，并不靠着走，彼此也不看，进行着一种奇特的、断断续续的交谈，就像灯塔闪烁的灯光，见到有穿党员制服的人走近，或靠近电幕时，他们会突然默不作声，接着，几分钟后会在说到一半的地方接着说，接着，在说好分手的地方猛地打断，接着，在第二天几乎没有任何介绍地继续说下去。朱丽亚似乎习惯了这种交谈，称之为“分段说话”。她也特别擅长说话时不动嘴唇。一个月的夜间见面里只有一次他们设法接了吻。他们默默地走进一条小巷（一离开大街，朱丽亚便不说话），这时，传来一声震耳欲聋的巨响，地面抖动，天空漆黑，温斯顿发现自己倒在地上，又惊又怕。附近肯定落了一颗火箭弹。突然，他看到不远处朱丽亚的脸，死人般惨白，像白粉笔似的。甚至嘴唇也是白的。她死了！他紧紧抱住她，发现他吻的是一个活人的温暖的脸。但他的嘴唇上满是粉末似的东西。原来他们两人的脸上都厚厚地盖了一层白墙灰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet. Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide. Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free. She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League, preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage. If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members. So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些夜晚，他们来到约会的地方，接着没有任何表示地互相走开，因为附近有巡警或头上直升机在盘旋。即使可能减少见面的危险性，也难于找到见面的时间。温斯顿每周的工作时间是六十小时，朱丽亚的工作时间更长，他们的休息日根据工作压力而定，经常凑不到一起。不管怎样，朱丽亚很少有一个晚上是完全自由的。她花大量的时间去听报告、参加游行、为青少年反性同盟发材料、给仇恨周准备标语、为节约运动搞募捐，以及其他诸如此类的活动。这是有收获的，她说。这是伪装。如果你遵守小规则，你就可以打破大规则。她甚至劝说温斯顿再拿出一个晚上，申请加班做军工活，而这工作是由热心的党员义务做的。所以，每周一个晚上，温斯顿花四个小时极其无聊地将一些金属小零件组装起来，这也许就是炸弹的引信。工作的地方是一个冷风嗖嗖、灯光暗淡的车间，汽锤的打击声和电幕播送的音乐可怕地交杂在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

The air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.</div>

<div class="line_en">Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel with thirty other girls ("Always in the stink of women! How I hate women!" she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. She was "not clever", but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery. She could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the finished product. She "didn't much care for reading," she said. Books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.</div>

At school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it, she remarked.

<div class="line_en">She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. "And a good job too," said Julia, "otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he confessed." Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it was quite simple. You wanted a good time; "they", meaning the Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She seemed to think it just as natural that "they" should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. She hated the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.</div>

It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she put it was:</div>

<div class="line_en">That was very true, he thought. There was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned it to account. They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说得很有道理，他想。禁欲和政治正统之间有一种直接、密切的联系。除非将某种强烈的本能控制起来，用作一种驱动力，否则怎么能把党在它的成员身上所要求的恐惧、仇恨和盲目信仰保持在一定的水平上？对党来说，性冲动是危险的，党要将它转化为可以利用的东西。他们在为人父母的问题上也玩了同样的花招。家庭实际上不可能加以废除，因而就鼓励父母以一种几乎是传统的方式爱护他们的孩子。另一方面，却有计划地让孩子反对父母，他们被教唆去刺探和告发父母的不端。家庭实际上成了思想警察的延伸。通过这种手段，每个人都会被熟悉他的告密者日夜监视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was three or four months after they were married. They had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry. It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the bottom. There was nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy. To be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them. One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on the same root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called to Katharine to come and look at it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是他们婚后三四个月。他们在一次集体远足中在肯特郡迷了路。他们只是落在同伴后面几分钟的路程，但他们拐错了弯，发现他们来到了一个旧采石场的边上。凯瑟琳刚意识到他们迷路了，她就变得很不安。远离一群吵吵嚷嚷的远足者，哪怕只是一会儿，她就觉得做错了事似的。她想马上回到他们来的那条路，开始寻找不同的方向。但此时，温斯顿注意到，他们脚下的岩石沟缝里长出几丛金钱草花。有一丛金钱草花有两种颜色：紫红色和砖红色，但它们明显是从同样的根部长出来的。他以前从来没有见过这种事，他叫凯瑟琳回来看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他突然想到了凯瑟琳。凯瑟琳无疑会向思想警察告发他，要不是她因愚蠢而觉察不了他的异端思想的话。但此刻让他真正想起她来的还是下午的闷热，他额头满是汗珠。他开始告诉朱丽亚，十一年前，也是一个炎热的夏日下午，发生或者说没有发生的一件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face. And the thought struck him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她已经转身要走，这时有些焦躁地回来看了一眼。她甚至从岩石上探身出去看他指的那个地方。他在她稍后一点站着，手扶着她的腰稳住她。这时，他突然想到，他们是多么孤单。四处一个人影也见不到，没有一片晃动的树叶，甚至一只飞鸟也没有。在这样一个地方，可能藏有窃听器的危险也很少，即使真有话筒也只能听到声音。这是下午最炎热、最困乏的时候。他们处在强烈的阳光下，他的脸上淌着汗水。一个念头产生了……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated. In a way she realized that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose. All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. She did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse.</div>
