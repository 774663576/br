<div class="line_en">There were many people -- men, women, and children -- walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这里，来来去去的许多人：男人、女人和孩子们，完全穿着绿衣服，连皮肤也略带绿色。他们都用惊异的眼光，注视着多萝茜，和她带领的这个奇怪的团体，当他们看见了狮子，所有的孩子们都一齐逃走了，躲到他们母亲的身后。但是没有一个人向他们说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多的店铺，排列在街上，多萝茜看见店里面的每一件东西，都是绿色的。出售绿的糖果，绿的爆玉蜀黍，还有各种各样的绿鞋子、绿帽子和绿衣衫。在另一个地方，有一个人出售绿的柠檬水，当孩子们去买这东西时，她看见他们付给的钱也是绿的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜和她的朋友们，虽然眼镜被绿眼镜遮住了，但是在最初都被这个神奇的城的光芒眩迷了。美丽的屋子，满布在各条街上，完全用绿大理石造成的，到处都用闪闪发光的翡翠装饰着的。他们走在同样绿大理石铺砌的人行道上，这是用一块一块的翡翠紧密地衔接起来造成的，一行一行的，被明亮的太阳照得灿烂闪烁。一块块的窗子，都镶嵌着绿色的玻璃。即使这城市上的天空，也发出一种淡淡的绿色，太阳的光线给染成绿的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="守城门的人，引导他们穿过了一些街道，直走到一所大厦的前面，这就是可怕的大魔术家奥芝的宫殿，恰恰建筑在这城市的中心。有一个兵士站在门前，穿着绿的制服，长着一丛长长的绿胡须。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.</div>

<div class="line_en">So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely: "Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Oz you are here." They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned.</div>

<div class="line_en">The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said, "Follow me and I will show you your room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，兵士吹着一个绿色的口笛，立刻有一个年青女郎，穿着一件美丽的绿丝袍，走进屋子来。她长着可爱的绿发和绿眼，当她说话的时候，还在多萝茜面前低低地鞠躬，“跟我来，我把你的房间指给你看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, no," returned the soldier; "I have never seen him. But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，没有，”兵士回答说：“我从来没有见过他。我只当他坐在帐幔的后面，向他说话，把你们的意思告诉他听。他说，你们这般地渴望着，允许你们去见他，但是，你们必须每一个单独地到他的面前，并且只准每天会见一个。所以你们必须在这宫中停留好几天。我要为你们开几个房间，在你们长途跋涉以后，可以休息得舒服一点儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When, at last, he came back, Dorothy asked: "Have you seen Oz?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们等了很长时间。当士兵回来以后，多萝茜问道：“你有没有看见过奥芝？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多萝茜向她的朋友们说声再会，只有托托除外，她把这狗抱起在臂弯里，跟着绿女郎穿过七个门廊，跑上三座楼梯，一直跑到宫殿前面的一间房间里。那是在世界上最美丽最可爱的小房间了，有一只柔软舒服的床，上面有绿绸的被，绿天鹅绒的褥。在房间的中央，有一个小喷水器，向空中射出一股绿色香水的水花，水花回落在一只雕刻得很美丽的绿色大理石的盆子里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一只衣橱里有许多绿衣服，用绸缎和天鹅绒做的，全部很适合多萝茜穿的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Make yourself perfectly at home," said the green girl, "and if you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow morning." She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你完全当作在自己的家里一样，”绿女郎说：“倘使你要什么东西，就请摇这个铃。明天早晨，奥芝会差人来叫你。”她让多萝茜独自留在房间里，自己再到别人那里去。她也把他们领到各个房间里去，每一个都觉得是宿在这宫殿里的房间里，十分快乐有趣。当然，这样的优待，对于稻草人是毫无用处的，因为当稻草人发觉自己独个人待在他的房间里时，很笨拙地站在门口，傻乎乎地等待着天明。他不能够躺下去休息，也不能够闭着他的眼睛，所以整夜醒着，凝视着房间的一个角落里，有一只小蜘蛛，正在织它的网，好像在这个世界上，这还算不是一间最奇异的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books. When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一些美丽的绿花，安放在窗子的旁边，在那里还有一个放着一行绿色小书的书架。当多萝茜去打开这些书来看时，发现里面满是引她好笑的奇怪的绿色图画，多么有趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子宁愿在森林中有一只干叶子的床，并且不喜欢被关在一间房间里。但是它很聪明的，不让这事情来麻烦自己，所以它跃上床去，像一只猫样地滚着，并且呜呜地叫着，在一分钟里睡熟了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，吃过早饭以后，绿女郎跑到多萝茜那里来，替她穿上衣裳中最美丽的一件——用绿锦缎做的。多萝茜还穿上一条绿绸的裙子，并且用一条绿丝带，缚在托托的颈项里，她们动身走向伟大的奥芝的王宫去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered: "Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初，她们跑到一个大厅里，在那里有许多朝廷上的贵妇和绅士，完全穿戴着富丽的服装。这些人没有事情做，彼此只是在闲谈，虽然他们从来没有被允许进去见一见奥芝，但是每天早晨，总是跑来在王宫外面侍候。当多萝茜跑进去了，他们好奇地注视她，其中有个低声问道：“你可是真正想抬着头去看看那可怕的奥芝的脸吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, he will see you," said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, "although he does not like to have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唔，他愿意会见你，”那个把她的意思传达给魔术家的兵士说，“虽然他不喜欢有人去请求见他。真的，起初他是愤怒的，并且说要把你从来的地方送回去。后来他问我你像个什么样子，当我说到你的银鞋子时，他觉得十分有趣。最后，我把你额角上的记号也告评了他，他就决定允许你到他的面前去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使得多萝茜最有兴趣的，是放在屋子中央的一张巨大的绿色大理石宝座。形状像一只椅子，也像其他的东西一样，闪着宝石的光。在椅子的正中，是一个非常巨大的头，没有身体支持它，就是手或脚什么也都没有。这个头，没有头发，只有一双眼睛和鼻子及嘴巴，大得比最大的巨人的头还要大。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, "That is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone." She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时候，一声铃响了，绿女郎对多萝茜说：“这是信号，你必须独个儿走进王宫里去。”女郎打开一个小门，多萝茜大胆地走进去，发觉自己到了一个神秘的地方。一个广大的圆屋子，盖着高拱形的房顶，四周的墙壁、天花板和地板，都是用大翡翠紧密地接连着的。在屋顶的中央是一盏很大的灯，亮得像太阳，也是用翡翠做的，在异样的光景中闪亮着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He did not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would be the lovely Lady. "For," he said to himself, "if it is the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly hearted.</div>

<div class="line_en">But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he was much disappointed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当铁皮人走进大宫殿中去，他所看见的既不是头，也不是妇人，因为奥芝变成了一只最可怕野兽。它大得几乎像一只象，这个绿的宫殿，似乎载负不起它的重量。这只野兽有一个像犀牛的头，不过在它的脸上却有五只服睛。在它身上长出五只长臂，也还有五条细长的腿。厚厚地羊毛似的毛盖满在全身，是一只样子可怕得不能想象的怪物。这是铁皮人的幸福，在那时候他还没有心，否则，他的心会因害怕而跳动得响而且快哩。只因为他是铁皮做的，虽然十分失望，却不大害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
