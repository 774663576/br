<div class="line_en">Mr and Mrs Heddegan both felt the honeymoon was not a success. They were happy to return to the island and start married life together in David Heddegan's large house. Baptista soon became as calm and passive as she had been before. She even smiled when neighbours called her Mrs Heddegan, and she began to enjoy the comfortable life that a rich husband could offer her. She did nothing at all to stop people finding out about her first marriage to Charles Stow, although there was always a danger of that happening.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was a mystery to me, madam!" he said, when she opened the door. "But now I understand it all. I want to tell you, madam, that I'm not a man to make trouble between husband and wife. But I'm going back to the mainland again, and I need a little more money. If your old man finds out about your first husband, I'm sure he won't like it, will he?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这对我来说曾是个谜，夫人！”她打开门时，他说道，“现在我全都明白了。我想告诉您，夫人，我不是那种在夫妻之间制造矛盾的人。但我打算再回到大陆上去，因此还需要一小笔钱。如果您老公发现您第一任丈夫的事，我敢保证他会不高兴的，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The workman stared at him. "That's not your --" he began, then he saw Baptista's face and stopped. Baptista was unable to speak, and the workman began to realize that there was a little mystery here. "I've been unlucky since then," he continued, still staring at Baptista's white face. "It's hard finding enough work to buy food for my wife and myself. Perhaps you could help me, because I once helped you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="工人瞪着他看。“那该不是你的——”他张口就说。接着，他看见了巴普蒂丝塔的脸，闭上了嘴。巴普蒂丝塔说不出话来，工人开始意识到这其中定有玄机。“从那以后我一直不走运，”他盯着巴普蒂丝塔苍白的脸，接着说，“我很难找到足够的工作来给自己和妻子糊口。你不妨帮帮我吧，因为我曾经帮过你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baptista gave him some money, and hoped never to see him again. But he was cleverer than he looked. By asking questions on the island and the mainland, he soon realized that Baptista had married one man on Tuesday, and another man on Wednesday. He visited her again two days later.</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew she had to tell her husband everything. She liked him better now than she had done at first, and did not want to lose him, but her secret was no longer safe. She went to find him, and said, "David, I have something to tell you."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不介意。事实上，我觉得事情没这么简单。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, my dear," he said with a sigh. In the last week he had been less cheerful and had seemed worried about something.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们一同来到客厅，她说：“戴维，或许你会因此而恨我，但我必须向你坦白我曾对你隐瞒的一些事。那发生在我们结婚之前，是关于一个情人的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, it was. I met my old lover by chance, and he asked me, and -- well, I married him. We were coming here to tell you, but he drowned, and I said nothing about him, and then I married you, David, for peace and quietness. Now you'll be angry with me, I know you will!"</div>

<div class="line_en">She knew he was right, and paid him what he wanted. A week later the workman sent his wife to ask for more money, and again Baptista paid. But when there was a fourth visit, she refused to pay, and shut the door in the man's surprised face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她知道他说得没错，于是便如了他的愿。一个星期后，工人又派他的老婆来要更多的钱，巴普蒂丝塔又一次满足了她。但等到工人第四次上门来的时候，她拒绝付钱，当面把一脸惊诧的工人关在了门外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here the conversation ended. The next day Baptista had to welcome her husband's daughters into her home.

She went about, sighing miserably, with no hope for the future.</div>
