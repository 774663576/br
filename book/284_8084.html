<div class="line_en">The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock collected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native servants always picked up or carried thing sand it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.</div>

<div class="line_en">The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车站很小，除了她们没有别人下车。车站长粗嗓门、好脾气地和莫得劳克太太说着话，他的口音奇怪，扁宽发瓮，后来玛丽得知他说的是约克郡话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spoken of. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up-a house standing on the edge of a moor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他关上门，和车夫一起堆好行李箱子，他们开车了。小女孩发现自己坐的角落有垫枕，不过她不准备再睡了。她看着窗外，这条路正带她前往莫得劳克太太说过的那个古怪地方，她好奇地想看看这条路。她决非胆小怕事的孩子，不能说她被吓着了，只不过她觉得前路难测，在一座有将近百个上锁房间的大房子里——一座牧尔边上的房子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, that's her," answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary. "How's thy Missus?"</div>

<div class="line_en">A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在外边的小站台前，停着一辆四轮马车。玛丽看到车厢时髦，扶她进车厢的车夫也挺时髦。他身上的防水长大衣、帽子上盖的防水布都滴着雨水，发着光，一切东西都如此，包括那个魁梧的站长。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于马开始慢下来，好像在上坡，现在没有灌木篱笆和树木了。除了两边的浓黑，她不见一物。马车来了个大颠簸，她身体前倾，脸压到玻璃窗上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is a moor?" she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么是牧尔？”她突兀地对莫得劳克太太说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,"the woman answered. "We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor. You won't see much because it's a dark night, but you can see something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“往窗外看上十分钟你就能看到，”女人回答，“我们得跑五英里穿过米瑟牧尔才能到庄园。你看不到多少，因为今晚天很黑，不过你也能看到一些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed. After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set our for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a longtime-or at least it seemed a long time to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽不再问了，只是在角落的黑暗里等着，眼睛望着窗外。马车灯在她们前面投下束束光线，经过的一些事物让她抓住匆匆一瞥。离站后，她们驶过一个极小的村庄，她看到白粉农舍，农舍里有灯光。而后她们经过了一座教堂，牧师的房子，农舍里橱窗模样的小窗，有玩具、糖果和其他零碎东西出售。然后她们上了公路，她看到灌木篱笆和树木。接下来很长时间没有任何变化——至少她觉得时间很长。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's-it's not the sea, is it?" said Mary, looking round at her companion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是——那不是海，是不是？”玛丽说，转过去看着她的旅伴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, not it," answered Mrs. Medlock. "Nor it isn't fields nor mountains, it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不是。”莫得劳克太太回答，“也不是田野和山脉，那是无边无际无边无际的荒地，什么也不长，只有着石楠、荆豆和金雀花，什么也不生，只有野马驹和绵羊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车灯的一道黄光照上粗糙的路面，这路看来是从灌木和低矮植物中穿过，那些植物终止于茫茫的黑暗里，那黑暗在植物前后左右蔓延开来。一道风起，声音单调、荒野、低沉、急促。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it," said Mary. "It sounds like the sea just now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得可能是海，要是上面有水的话，”玛丽说，“刚才听着像海。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们在黑暗里一直一直行驶，尽管雨停了，风急急掠过，呼啸着发出怪声。路时高时低，马车过了几座小桥，桥下水流很急，噪音大作。玛丽觉得这路程永远完不了，那宽广、荒寒的牧尔是一片茫茫的海洋，她正沿着一线干地穿过它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's the wind blowing through the bushes," Mrs. Medlock said."It's a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likes it-particularly when the heather's in bloom."</div>

<div class="line_en">The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马正在一段上坡路的时候，玛丽看到了亮光。莫得劳克太太舒了一口长气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eh, I am glad to see that bit of light twinkling,"she exclaimed. "It's the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events."</div>

<div class="line_en">They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner upstairs showed a dull glow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们的车从圆顶拱廊驶进一片开阔地，停在一栋长不可测但修得很低的房子前面，房子似乎松散地围着一个石头院子。起初玛丽以为那些窗户里没有灯，但是她下马车后看见楼上一角有暗淡的红光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was "after a bit," as she said, for when the carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实要“等一下”，就像她说的，因为马车进了庄园大门后又在林荫道上走了两英里，两旁树木在头顶几乎相接，犹如穿行在一道昏暗的圆顶拱廊中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="入口的巨门用厚重的橡木嵌板做成，嵌板形状新奇，装饰着大铁钉，镶着大铁棍。它开向一间巨大的厅堂，灯光昏暗，墙上画像的脸、穿铠甲的人体都让玛丽不愿多看一眼。她站在石头地面上，成了一个渺小、奇怪的黑影。她外面的形象和心里的感觉，是一样的微小，迷失，古怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
