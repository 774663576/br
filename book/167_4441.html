<div class="line_en">Obedient to his wishes, the Myraham beat her way past the point with her sails snapping and her captain cursing the wind and his crew and the follies of highborn lordlings. Theon drew the hood of his cloak up against the spray, and looked for home.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no safe anchorage at Pyke, but Theon Greyjoy wished to look on his father's castle from the sea, to see it as he had seen it last, ten years before, when Robert Baratheon's war galley had borne him away to be a ward of Eddard Stark. On that day he had stood beside the rail, listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the master's drum while he watched Pyke dwindle in the distance. Now he wanted to see it grow larger, to rise from the sea before him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派克城周围虽无停泊之处，席恩仍想从海上看看父亲的城堡，一如十年之前。当年劳勃·拜拉席恩的战船载他远离家园，去作艾德·史塔克的养子。那天他站在船栏边，听着船桨划水和桨官的鼓声，望着派克城在远方逐渐缩小。现在，他想看着它从眼前的海平线上升起，慢慢变大。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs, and the castle seemed one with the rest, its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone, wet by the same salt waves, festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen, speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds. The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised their fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean, but the waves had hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered, thousands of years past. All that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea god's temple, while the angry waves foamed and crashed among them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岸边全是尖石绝壁，整个城堡彷佛与之结为一体，塔楼、城墙、桥梁和悬壁有着同样灰黑石材，同样恶浪侵袭，同样暗苔攀附，同样鸟粪遍布。葛雷乔伊家族堡垒所在的角岬，曾经如剑一般地刺进海中，然而历经浪涛日夜拍打，早在千年前这块土地便已支离破碎，如今只剩三座贫瘠荒岛，以及十二根高耸巨岩，彷佛祭祀某个无名海神的圣殿支柱，怒涛则继续肆虐其间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword, the oldest part of the castle, round and tall, the sheer-sided pillar on which it stood half-eaten through by the endless battering of the waves. The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray, the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket, the jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圆形的“海中塔”自最外岛如断剑般的裂口处拔高窜起，这是城堡最古老的建筑，其下的陡峭海柱被无数浪花摧残，几被腐蚀殆尽。高塔底部有几世纪以来累积的白色盐晶，上方的楼层则爬满绿色地衣，像是盖了一层厚厚的毯子；尖锐的塔顶色呈烟黑，守夜篝火长年不绝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Drear, dark, forbidding, Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars, almost a part of them, its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet, dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep. Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep, each on its own island. Towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond, linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close, by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派克城高耸于三岛与海柱之上，与它们浑然一体，其势阴沉而不可侵犯。通往最大岛的石桥所在陆岬被高墙所阻隔，巨大的主堡便位于该岛，远处则是“厨堡”和“血堡”，各自占据一座小岛。海柱上有高塔和外屋，倘若彼此距离近，便以封闭的拱形通道相连，若是距离较远，则用长而摇晃的木绳吊桥衔接。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Above the Sea Tower snapped his father's banner. The Myraham was too far off for Theon to see more than the cloth itself, but he knew the device it bore: the golden kraken of House Greyjoy, arms writhing and reaching against a black field. The banner streamed from an iron mast, shivering and twisting as the wind gusted, like a bird struggling to take flight. And here at least the direwolf of Stark did not fly above, casting its shadow down upon the Greyjoy kraken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲的旗帜在海中塔顶飘动。密拉罕号距离太远，因此席恩只看到旗帜本身，但他很清楚上面的图案：葛雷乔伊家族的金色海怪，手脚蠕动，背景墨黑。旗帜高悬于铁杆，在劲风中颤动，宛如挣扎欲飞的鸟。此地没有史塔克家冰原狼飞扬跋扈的余地，葛雷乔伊家的海怪不需寄居其阴影之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It looks smaller," Theon confessed, "though perhaps that is only the distance." The Myraham was a fat-bellied southron merchanter up from Oldtown, carrying wine and cloth and seed to trade for iron ore. Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well, and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver, so he stayed well out, farther than Theon would have liked. An ironborn captain in a longship would have taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the gatehouse and the Great Keep, but this plump Oldtowner had neither the craft, the crew, nor the courage to attempt such a thing. So they sailed past at a safe distance, and Theon must content himself with seeing Pyke from afar. Even so, the Myraham had to struggle mightily to keep itself off those rocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小了些，”席恩坦承，“大概是距离的关系。”密拉罕号是一艘来自旧镇的南方大肚子商船，载运着葡萄酒、布料和种子，准备前去交换铁矿。船长同样是个来自南方的大肚子商人，他一见到城堡下方的崎岖岩岸，便噘起厚厚的嘴唇，远远避开滩头，对此席恩颇感不悦。换做是铁岛出身的船长驾驶长船，一定会沿着峭壁，穿过横跨主堡与城门楼之间的桥梁，然而这个肥胖的旧镇佬既无那种技术，也没有够格的船员，更没有勇气尝试这样的行为。于是他们保持在安全距离之外航经派克城，席恩只能远远眺望。即便如此，密拉罕号还费了好一番功夫才没撞上礁石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Does the castle look as you remember it, milord?" the captain's daughter asked as she pressed herself against his arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theon had never seen a more stirring sight. In the sky behind the castle, the fine red tail of the comet was visible through thin, scuttling clouds. All the way from Riverrun to Seagard, the Mallisters had argued about its meaning. It is my comet, Theon told himself, sliding a hand into his fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket. Inside was the letter Robb Stark had given him, paper as good as a crown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="席恩从未见过如此慑人的景象：城堡后方天际薄云疾走，隐约可见彗星的红尾巴。从奔流城走到海疆城，梅利斯特家的人一路争论彗星的意义。这是我的彗星，席恩对自己说，把手伸进绒毛披风的口兜，摸摸油布小袋。这里有罗柏·史塔克给他的信，虽是薄纸一张，却与王冠等价。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He laughed. "Windy and cold and damp. A miserable hard place, in truth… but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men, and hard men rule the world."</div>

<div class="line_en">The captain's face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to Theon and asked, "May we make for port now, milord?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，脸色变得像海水一样青的船长走过来向席恩打躬作揖，问道：“大人，我们可否立即入港？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You may," Theon said, a faint smile playing about his lips. The promise of gold had turned the Oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle. It would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as he'd hoped. Ironborn captains were proud and willful, and did not go in awe of a man's blood. The islands were too small for awe, and a longship smaller still. If every captain was a king aboard his own ship, as was often said, it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings. And when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm, it was hard to bend the knee and pretend they were gods. "The Drowned God makes men," old King Urron Redhand had once said, thousands of years ago, "but it's men who make crowns."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以。”一抹浅笑拂过席恩嘴唇。他不过靠点黄金，便使这旧镇佬厚颜无耻地卑躬屈膝。若当初在海疆城等他的是艘铁岛长船，这趟旅途肯定大不相同。只是铁岛船长个个心高气傲，难以使唤，见了贵族也不会大惊小怪。铁群岛是个小地方，没有什么大世面，长船则比岛更小。俗谚云“每个船长都是自己船上的国王”，也难怪这里被称为“万王之地”。一旦你看过自己的王在船栏边拉屎，或在暴风雨中面色发青，便说什么也没法向他们下跪了，遑论奉若神明，所以每个船长都必须强硬。几千年前，“血手”乌伦王说过：淹神造人，人造王冠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well. The Myraham was a wallowing tub, if truth be told, and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm. Still, Theon could not be too unhappy. He was here, undrowned, and the voyage had offered certain other amusements. He put an arm around the captain's daughter. "Summon me when we make Lordsport," he told her father. "We'll be below, in my cabin." He led the girl away aft, while her father watched them go in sullen silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="您离家有几年了如果他乘坐长船，横跨大洋的时间也会减半。老实说，密拉罕号根本是个行动困难的大澡盆。若是碰上暴风雨，他可不想待在这艘船上。不过话说回来，席恩也没什么好抱怨的，起码他到了家，也没淹死，何况旅途中还有其他“娱乐”。他伸手搂住船长的女儿，“抵达君王港再通知我，”他对她父亲说，“我们回房去。”他领着女孩朝船尾走去，留下她敢怒不敢言的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cabin was the captain's, in truth, but it had been turned over to Theon's use when they sailed from Seagard. The captain's daughter had not been turned over to his use, but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same. A cup of wine, a few whispers, and there she was. The girl was a shade plump for his taste, with skin as splotchy as oatmeal, but her breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her. That was surprising at her age, but Theon found it diverting. He did not think the captain approved, and that was amusing as well, watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord, the rich purse of gold he'd been promised never far from his thoughts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实这原本是船长的房间，但他们自海疆城启航之后，便交由席恩使用。船长的女儿并没有一并交他“使用”，而是自己听话地上了他的床。一杯酒，几句甜言蜜语，她便乖乖就范。对他来说，这女孩嫌胖了点，皮肤和燕麦一样斑斑点点，不过她的乳房握在手里很舒服，况且本来还是个处女。照说以她的年龄不应如此，席恩稍觉奇怪。他相信船长对此一定大为不满，可眼看那家伙一边强忍怒火，一边对他卑躬屈膝，脑子里总打着事成后高额赏金的算盘，却也是妙事一桩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Count yourself fortunate." Theon stroked her hair. It was fine and dark, though the wind had made a tangle of it. "The islands are stern and stony places, scant of comfort and bleak of prospect. Death is never far here, and life is mean and meager. Men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse, the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil. If truth be told, the miners have it worse than either, breaking their backs down in the dark, and for what? Iron, lead, tin, those are our treasures. Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是你运气好。”席恩抚弄着她的头发，头发又黑又滑，只可惜饱经风吹雨打，有些打结。“铁群岛环境严苛，地形崎岖，既无舒适生活，也无前途可言。活着的时候日子很难过，死亡与你形影不离。人们晚上喝酒寻乐之际，都是在比谁过得凄惨，是和大海搏斗的渔夫呢，还是想从贫瘠土地里挖出一点作物的农人。老实讲，最可怜的要数矿工，他们成天在黑暗中卖命，到头来都为了什么？铁、铅还有锡。难怪古代铁民要外出劫掠。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ten, or close as makes no matter," he told her. "I was a boy of ten when I was taken to Winterfell as a ward of Eddard Stark." A ward in name, a hostage in truth. Half his days a hostage… but no longer. His life was his own again, and nowhere a Stark to be seen. He drew the captain's daughter close and kissed her on her ear. "Take off your cloak."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多十年。”他告诉她，“当初我被送到临冬城当艾德·史塔克养子时，只有十岁。”名义上是养子，实际则是人质。他当了半辈子人质…如今总算重获自由，再度掌握自己的生命，再也不需被史塔克家颐指气使。他把船长的女儿拉近，亲亲她耳朵，“把斗篷脱了吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

When the heavy garment, sodden with spray, fell from her shoulders to the deck, she gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously.

Once I would have kept her as a salt wife in truth, he thought to himself as he slid his fingers through her tangled hair. Once. When we still kept the Old Way, lived by the axe instead of the pick, taking what we would, be it wealth, women, or glory. In those days, the ironborn did not work mines; that was labor for the captives brought back from the hostings, and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep.

This is the season, Theon thought as the captain's daughter slid her lips up and down the length of him, the season, the year, the day, and I am the man. He smiled crookedly, wondering what his father would say when Theon told him that he, the last-born, babe and hostage, he had succeeded where Lord Balon himself had failed.</div>

When he was a boy it had been timber and wattle, but Robert Baratheon had razed that structure to the ground. Lord Sawane had rebuilt in stone, for now a small square keep crowned the hill.

<div class="line_en">Beneath the dubious protection of the fish-ridden little castle lay the village of Lordsport, its harbor aswarm with ships. When last he'd seen Lordsport, it had been a smoking wasteland, the skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys littering the stony shore like the bones of dead leviathans, the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes. After ten years, few traces of the war remained. The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the old, and cut fresh sod for their roofs. A new inn had risen beside the landing, twice the size of the old one, with a lower story of cut stone and two upper stories of timber. The sept beyond had never been rebuilt, though; only a seven-sided foundation remained where it had stood. Robert Baratheon's fury had soured the ironmen's taste for the new gods, it would seem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在小城堡看起来不太可靠的保护之下是名为君王港的渔村，码头停满船只。他上回见到的君王港是浓烟密布的废墟，崎岖岩岸边布满长船余烬和舰艇残骸，宛如死去海怪的尸身，房舍也仅存断垣残壁和冷却烟灰。十年过后，战争的痕迹几不复见。村民用旧石筑起新屋，割下草皮搭建屋顶。码头边盖了一间新旅店，足足有旧时的两倍大，一楼用石砖砌成，二三楼则是木头材质。旁边的圣堂始终没有重建，只剩当初的七角基底，看来劳勃·拜拉席恩的怒火已经彻底坏了铁岛人对新神的胃口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theon was more interested in ships than gods. Among the masts of countless fishing boats, he spied a Tyroshi trading galley off-loading beside a lumbering Ibbenese cog with her black-tarred hull. A great number of longships, fifty or sixty at the least, stood out to sea or lay beached on the pebbled shore to the north. Some of the sails bore devices from the other islands; the blood moon of Wynch, Lord Goodbrother's banded black warhorn, Harlaw's silver scythe. Theon searched for his uncle Euron's Silence. Of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign, but his father's Great Kraken was there, her bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake.</div>

His father was old now, and so too his uncle Victarion, who commanded the Iron Fleet. His uncle Euron was a different song, to be sure, but the Silence did not seem to be in port. It's all for the good, Theon told himself. This way, I shall be able to strike all the more quickly.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the Myraham made her way landward, Theon paced the deck restlessly, scanning the shore. He had not thought to find Lord Balon himself at quayside, but surely his father would have sent someone to meet him. Sylas Sourmouth the steward, Lord Botley, perhaps even Dagmer Cleftjaw. It would be good to look on Dagmer's hideous old face again. It was not as though they had no word of his arrival.

Patrek Mallister was not too ill a fellow; they shared a taste for wenches, wine, and hawking. But when old Lord Jason saw his heir growing overly fond of Theon's company, he had taken Patrek aside to remind him that Seagard had been built to defend the coast against reavers from the Iron Islands, the Greyjoys of Pyke chief among them.

Only Robb and his baseborn half brother Jon Snow had been old enough to be worth his notice. The bastard was a sullen boy, quick to sense a slight, jealous of Theon's high birth and Robb's regard for him. For Robb himself, Theon did have a certain affection, as for a younger brother… but it would be best not to mention that. In Pyke, it would seem, the old wars were still being fought. That ought not surprise him. The Iron Islands lived in the past; the present was too hard and bitter to be borne.

<div class="line_en">But Greyjoys were not murdered in Pyke except once in a great while by their brothers, and his brothers were both dead. It was not fear of ghosts that made him glance about with distaste. The wall hangings were green with mildew, the mattress musty-smelling and sagging, the rushes old and brittle. Years had come and gone since these chambers had last been opened. The damp went bone deep. "I'll have a basin of hot water and a fire in this hearth," he told the crone. "See that they light braziers in the other rooms to drive out some of the chill. And gods be good, get someone in here at once to change these rushes."</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever he'd imagined his homecoming, he had always pictured himself returning to the snug bedchamber in the Sea Tower, where he'd slept as a child. Instead the old woman led him to the Bloody Keep. The halls here were larger and better furnished, if no less cold nor damp. Theon was given a suite of chilly rooms with ceilings so high that they were lost in gloom. He might have been more impressed if he had not known that these were the very chambers that had given the Bloody Keep its name. A thousand years before, the sons of the River King had been slaughtered here, hacked to bits in their beds so that pieces of their bodies might be sent back to their father on the mainland.</div>

It was only tepid, and soon cold, and seawater in the bargain, but it served to wash the dust of the long ride from his face and hair and hands. While two thralls lit his braziers, Theon stripped off his travel-stained clothing and dressed to meet his father. He chose boots of supple black leather, soft lambswool breeches of silvery-grey, a black velvet doublet with the golden kraken of the Greyjoys embroidered on the breast. Around his throat he fastened a slender gold chain, around his waist a belt of bleached white leather. He hung a dirk at one hip and a longsword at the other, in scabbards striped black-and-gold. Drawing the dirk, he tested its edge with his thumb, pulled a whetstone from his belt pouch, and gave it a few licks. He prided himself on keeping his weapons sharp. "When I return, I shall expect a warm room and clean rushes," he warned the thralls as he drew on a pair of black gloves, the silk decorated with a delicate scrollwork tracery in golden thread.</div>

<div class="line_en">Theon returned to the Great Keep through a covered stone walkway, the echoes of his footsteps mingling with the ceaseless rumble of the sea below. To get to the Sea Tower on its crooked pillar, he had to cross three further bridges, each narrower than the one before. The last was made of rope and wood, and the wet salt wind made it sway underfoot like a living thing. Theon's heart was in his mouth by the time he was halfway across. A long way below, the waves threw up tall plumes of spray as they crashed against the rock. As a boy, he used to run across this bridge, even in the black of night. Boys believe nothing can hurt them, his doubt whispered. Grown men know better.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Out of my way, or you'll learn who I am." The man stood aside. Theon climbed the twisting steps to the solar. He found his father seated beside a brazier, beneath a robe of musty sealskins that covered him foot to chin. At the sound of boots on stone, the Lord of the Iron Islands lifted his eyes to behold his last living son. He was smaller than Theon remembered him. And so gaunt. Balon Greyjoy had always been thin, but now he looked as though the gods had put him in a cauldron and boiled every spare ounce of flesh from his bones, until nothing remained but hair and skin. Bone thin and bone hard he was, with a face that might have been chipped from flint.
