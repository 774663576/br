<div class="line_en">"It must be a dream, it must, it must," said Jill to herself. "I'll wake up in a moment." But it wasn't, and she didn't.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without a glance at Jill the lion rose to its feet and gave one last blow. Then, as if satisfied with its work, it turned and stalked slowly away, back into the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子看也不朝吉尔看一眼，就站起身来，再吹了最后一口气。于是，它好像很满意自己的工作似的，转身昂首慢步走开，回到树林里去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do wish we'd never come to this dreadful place," said Jill. "I don't believe Scrubb knew any more about it than I do. Or if he did, he had no business to bring me here without warning me what it was like. It's not my fault he fell over that cliff. If he'd left me alone we should both be all right." Then she remembered again the scream that Scrubb had given when he fell, and burst into tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要是没到这个可怕的地方来就好了，”吉尔说，“我相信斯克罗布跟我一样，对这个地方也不了解。要是他了解的话，事先不告诫我这是个什么鬼地方，就不该把我带到这儿来。他摔下悬崖可不是我的错。要是他别管我，我们俩就都没事了。”后来她又想起斯克罗布摔下去时尖声叫喊，不由哇的一声大哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do. When Jill stopped, she found she was dreadfully thirsty. She had been lying face downward, and now she sat up. The birds had ceased singing and there was perfect silence except for one small, persistent sound, which seemed to come from a good distance away. She listened carefully, and felt almost sure it was the sound of running water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大哭一场固然痛快。不过你早晚还得停下来，然后还得决定怎么办。等吉尔不哭了，她觉得自己渴得要命。她原来一直脸朝下趴着，现在就坐了起来。鸟儿都不唱歌了，四下一片寂静，只有远处似乎传来一种连续不断的小声音。她仔细倾听，几乎肯定这就是流水的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill got up and looked round her very carefully. There was no sign of the lion; but there were so many trees about that it might easily be quite close without her seeing it. For all she knew, there might be several lions. But her thirst was very bad now, and she plucked up her courage to go and look for that running water. She went on tiptoes, stealing cautiously from tree to tree, and stopping to peer round her at every step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔站起来，小心翼翼地朝四周张望。狮子早没影了；不过周围有那么多树，它很可能就待在附近，只是她看不见罢了。说不定那儿可能有好几头狮子呢。但她这会儿实在是口干舌燥，于是她鼓起勇气去寻找流水。她踞起脚，小心地偷偷从一棵树溜到另一棵树，每走一步都停下四处张望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wood was so still that it was not difficult to decide where the sound was coming from. It grew clearer every moment and, sooner than she expected, she came to an open glade and saw the stream, bright as glass, running across the turf a stone's throw away from her. But although the sight of the water made her feel ten times thirstier than before, she didn't rush forward and drink. She stood as still as if she had been turned into stone, with her mouth wide open. And she had a very good reason; just on this side of the stream lay the lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="森林里一片寂静，要肯定声音从哪儿来并不困难。水声越来越清晰，没想到一下子就来到一片林间空地，看到了那条小溪，像玻璃似的亮晶晶，就在离她不远的地方流过草地。虽然看到了水反而比刚才更渴上十倍，但她并没有冲上前去喝上一口。她就站在那儿，张大嘴巴，一动也不动，像变成了石头人似的。而且她还有充分理由：那头狮子就躺在小溪的这一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It lay with its head raised and its two fore-paws out in front of it, like the lions in Trafalgar Square. She knew at once that it had seen her, for its eyes looked straight into hers for a moment and then turned away -- as if it knew her quite well and didn't think much of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狮子昂起头，两只前爪伸在前面，躺着的姿势就像特拉法尔加广场①的狮像。她立刻就知道它已经看见她了，因为它眼睛直勾勾地盯着她眼睛看了一会儿，这才掉转眼光——它似乎已经相当了解她，不大看重她了。（注：①特拉法尔加广场：在英国伦敦的威斯敏斯特。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If I run away, it'll be after me in a moment," thought Jill. "And if I go on, I shall run straight into its mouth." Anyway, she couldn't have moved if she had tried, and she couldn't take her eyes off it. How long this lasted, she could not be sure; it seemed like hours. And the thirst became so bad that she almost felt she would not mind being eaten by the lion if only she could be sure of getting a mouthful of water first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我跑开呢，它马上就会来追我，”吉尔想道，“如果我继续往前走呢，我就会一直走到它嘴里去。”不管怎么说，要是她想动，她也动不了，而且她眼光也离不开它。这样僵持了多久，她可无法确定；似乎有好几个小时吧。再说，口越来越渴，渴得她几乎感到只要能保证先喝上一口水，即使被狮子吃了也不在乎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you're thirsty, you may drink."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是你渴了，尽管喝吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were the first words she had heard since Scrubb had spoken to her on the edge of the cliff. For a second she stared here and there, wondering who had spoken. Then the voice said again, "If you are thirsty, come and drink," and of course she remembered what Scrubb had said about animals talking in that other world, and realized that it was the lion speaking. Anyway, she had seen its lips move this time, and the voice was not like a man's. It was deeper, wilder, and stronger; a sort of heavy, golden voice. It did not make her any less frightened than she had been before, but it made her frightened in rather a different way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从斯克罗布在悬崖边上跟她说话以来，这可是她听到的第一句话。一时间她睁大眼睛到处张望，不知是谁在说话。接着那声音又说了“要是你渴了，过来喝吧。”她当然想起斯克罗布说过另外那个世界的动物会说话的事，心里明白就是那头狮子在说话。不管怎么说，这回她看见狮子的嘴唇在动，而且这声音也不像是男人的声音。这声音更加深沉，更加粗野，更加有力，是一种凝重、洪亮的声音。这声音并没有使她比刚才少害怕一点，只是害怕的程度不同罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It never occurred to Jill to disbelieve the Lion -- no one who had seen his stern face could do that -- and her mind suddenly made itself up. It was the worst thing she had ever had to do, but she went forward to the stream, knelt down, and began scooping up water in her hand. It was the coldest, most refreshing water she had ever tasted. You didn't need to drink much of it, for it quenched your thirst at once. Before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the Lion the moment she had finished. Now, she realized that this would be on the whole the most dangerous thing of all. She got up and stood there with her lips still wet from drinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔根本没想过不相信这只狮子——看见过它那张神色严峻的脸的人，没一个能不相信它——于是她突然下了决心。她虽从来没挺而走险过，但她还是向前走到溪边，跪下，用手百起水来。她从来没喝过这么凉爽、这么提神的水。你用不着多喝，因为喝了这水立刻就解渴了。没喝水以前，她一直打算一喝完就飞快地从狮子身边奔开。这会儿，她看出这样做是件最最危险的事。她刚喝过水，嘴唇还是湿的，就那么直起身子，站在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will tell you, Child," said the Lion. "These are the signs by which I will guide you in your quest. First; as soon as the Boy Eustace sets foot in Narnia, he will meet an old and dear friend. He must greet that friend at once; if he does, you will both have good help. Second; you must journey out of Narnia to the north till you come to the ruined city of the ancient giants. Third; you shall find a writing on a stone in that ruined city, and you must do what the writing tells you.

Say them to yourself when you wake in the morning and when you lie down at night, and when you wake in the middle of the night. And whatever strange things may happen to you, let nothing turn your mind from following the signs. And secondly, I give you a warning. Here on the mountain I have spoken to you clearly: I will not often do so down in Narnia. Here on the mountain, the air is clear and your mind is clear; as you drop down into Narnia, the air will thicken. Take great care that it does not confuse your mind. And the signs which you have learned here will not look at all as you expect them to look, when you meet them there. That is why it is so important to know them by heart and pay no attention to appearances. Remember the signs and believe the signs. Nothing else matters. And now, daughter of Eve, farewell --"</div>

She had been setting her teeth and clenching her fists for a terrible blast of lion's breath; but the breath had really been so gentle that she had not even noticed the moment at which she left the earth. And now, there was nothing but air for thousands upon thousands of feet below her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番话说到末了，声音越来越柔和，这会儿已经完全消失了。吉尔往身后看看口令她大吃一惊的是，只见那座悬崖已经在她后面一百多码以外了，狮子已成了悬崖上金光闪闪的一小点。她本来一直咬紧牙关，握紧拳头，准备承受狮子那口气的可怕威力，但这口气其实十分柔和，她甚至没注意到自己离开地面的那一时刻。眼前，只有身子下的万丈高空而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she looked back now she could take in for the first time the real size of the mountain she was leaving. She wondered why a mountain so huge as that was not covered with snow and ice -- "but I suppose all that sort of thing is different in this world," thought Jill. Then she looked below her; but she was so high that she couldn't make out whether she was floating over land or sea, nor what speed she was going at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时她回头一看，才头一回看清刚才离开的那座山头的真正规模。不知为什么像这么雄伟的一座大山竟没有冰雪覆盖——“不过我想在这个世界里一切事物都不一样了。”吉尔想道。接着她朝下面望望；但她飘得太高了，所以她弄不清自己是在陆地还是在海洋上飘，也弄不清自己的飘行速度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She felt frightened only for a second. For one thing, the world beneath her was so very far away that it seemed to have nothing to do with her. For another, floating on the breath of the Lion was so extremely comfortable. She found she could lie on her back or on her face and twist any way she pleased, just as you can in water (if you've learned to float really well). And because she was moving at the same pace as the breath, there was no wind, and the air seemed beautifully warm. It was not in the least like being in an aeroplane, because there was no noise and no vibration. If Jill had ever been in a balloon she might have thought it more like that; only better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她只有一瞬间觉得害怕，一来在她下面的世界是那么遥远，似乎跟她没有关系；二来，在狮子吹的气上飘浮真是舒服极了。她发觉自己可以仰卧，也可以俯卧，爱怎么转身都行，就像你能在水中随意活动一样（如果你的浮水功夫学得很好的话）。而且因为她转动的速度跟狮子呼的气同步，天上没有凤，空气也似乎暖和极了。这完全不像乘在飞机上，因为既没有声音也没有振动。要是吉尔乘过气球，她可能会觉得这更像乘气球，不过更妙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun which had been high overhead when she began her journey was now getting into her eyes. This meant that it was getting lower, ahead of her. Scrubb was quite right in saying that Jill (I don't know about girls in general) didn't think much about points of the compass. Otherwise she would have known, when the sun began getting in her eyes, that she was travelling pretty nearly due west.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始上路时太阳是当头照的，如今已照进她眼睛了。这就意味着太阳已经在她前面，要下山了。斯克罗布说得不错，他说吉尔（我不了解一般女孩子）不大重视指南针的方位。否则她就该知道，当太阳照进她眼睛时，她就大致是朝正西方向飘行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What it looked like was an enormous, very dark blue plain. There were no hills to be seen; but there were biggish white things moving slowly across it. "Those must be clouds," she thought. "But far bigger than the ones we saw from the cliff. I suppose they're bigger because they're nearer. I must be getting lower. Bother this sun."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下面是一片其大无比的深蓝色平原口看不见山丘，只有一些又大又白的东西慢慢穿过上面。“那些一定是云，”她想，“但比我们在悬崖上看到的大多了。我想，云变大了，就是离得近了。我一定是飘得低些了。太阳真讨厌。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I do declare," said Jill to herself some hours later, "I've been asleep. Fancy sleeping on air. I wonder if anyone's done it before. I don't suppose they have. Oh bother -- Scrubb probably has! On this same journey, a little bit before me. Let's see what it looks like down below."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，真怪！”过了几小时，吉尔自言自语说，“我睡着了。想想真怪，在空中睡觉。我真想知道以前有没有人睡过。我想没人睡过。唉，讨厌——斯克罗布也许睡过！他跟我走的是同一条路，比我早一点。让我瞧瞧下面是什么样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"By Jove! The signs!" said Jill suddenly. "I'd better repeat them." She was in a panic for a second or two, but she found she could still say them all correctly. "So that's all right," she said, and lay back on the air as if it was a sofa, with a sigh of contentment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天哪，指示”吉尔突然说，”我最好还是再背背吧。”她一时惊慌失措，但她发现自己竟还能一字不差地全都背出来。”这就没事了。”她说。她像躺在沙发上一样仰卧在空中，满意地叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Staring at the blue plain below her, she presently noticed that there were little dots of brighter, paler colour in it here and there. "It's the sea!" thought Jill. "I do believe those are islands." And so they were. She might have felt rather jealous if she had known that some of them were islands which Scrubb had seen from a ship's deck and even landed on; but she didn't know this. Then, later on, she began to see that there were little wrinkles on the blue flatness: little wrinkles which must be quite big ocean waves if you were down among them. And now, all along the horizon there was a thick dark line which grew thicker and darker so quickly that you could see it growing. That was the first sign she had had of the great speed at which she was travelling. And she knew that the thickening line must be land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她凝视着下面那片蓝色的平原，不久就注意到其中到处都是色彩淡些亮些的小点。“原来是海，”吉尔想，“我相信那些是岛屿。”事实上果然如此。要是她知道斯克罗布曾经在一艘船的甲板上看到过其中几个岛，甚至还到岛上去过，她早就妒忌死了，但她并不知道。后来，又过了一会儿，她才开始看出那一片蓝色中有些小小的皱纹•要是你在下面身历其境，这些小小的皱纹一定是很大的海浪了。这会儿，天边出现了一道粗粗的黑线，这道线很快就变得更粗，更黑，快得你都看得见那道线在变化。这是她正飞速行进的第一个迹象。她知道这越来越粗的线一定就是陆地了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly from her left (for the wind was in the south) a great white cloud came rushing towards her, this time on the same level as herself. And before she knew where she was, she had shot right into the middle of its cold, wet fogginess. That took her breath away, but she was in it only for a moment. She came out blinking in the sunlight and found her clothes wet. (She had on a blazer and sweater and shorts and stockings and pretty thick shoes; it had been a muddy sort of day in England.) She came out lower than she had gone in; and as soon as she did so she noticed something which, I suppose, she ought to have been expecting, but which came as a surprise and a shock. It was Noises. Up till then she had travelled in total silence. Now, for the first time, she heard the noise of waves and the crying of seagulls. And now, too, she smelled the smell of the sea. There was no mistake about her speed now. She saw two waves meet with a smack and a spout of foam go up between them; but she had hardly seen it before it was a hundred yards behind her. The land was getting nearer at a great pace. She could see mountains far inland, and other nearer mountains on her left. She could see bays and headlands, woods and fields, stretches of sandy beach. The sound of waves breaking on the shore was growing louder every second and drowning the other sea noises.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，从她的左面（因为风是南面来的）一大朵白云直向她冲来，这次跟她在同一高度。她还不知道自己身在何方，就一下子钻到冷冰冰、湿漉漉、雾蒙蒙的云中去了。这使她大吃一惊，但她在云层里只待了一会儿。出来时她对着阳光直眨眼睛，而且身上衣服都湿了。（她穿着运动衣、羊毛衫、短裤、长袜和很厚的鞋，英国那时节正是泥泞天。）她出云层时比进去时飘得更低一些——她一出来就注意到有动静，我看这应该是她一直在盼望的，然而竟使她大为惊讶和震动。原来是声音。迄今为止，她是在完全寂静中飘行的。如今，她第一次听见了海浪声和海鸥叫。同时她也闻到了海洋的气息。如今她飘行速度之快是绝对错不了的。她刚看见两股海浪啪的一下汇合在一起，中间冒起一股泡沫；但她还没看清，这些己落在她身后一百码的地方了。陆地正高速离她越来越近。她看得见远在内陆的山峦，以及近在她左面的其他山头。她看得见海湾和海师，树林和田野，绵延不断的海滨沙滩。海浪扑打岸边的声音越来越响，淹没了海洋其他的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing she thought was how very grubby and untidy and generally unimpressive he looked. And the second was "How wet I am!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the land opened right ahead of her. She was coming to the mouth of a river. She was very low now, only a few feet above the water. A wave-top came against her toe and a great splash of foam spurted up, drenching her nearly to the waist. Now she was losing speed. Instead of being carried up the river she was gliding in to the river bank on her left. There were so many things to notice that she could hardly take them all in; a smooth, green lawn, a ship so brightly coloured that it looked like an enormous piece of jewellery, towers and battlements, banners fluttering in the air, a crowd, gay clothes, armour, gold, swords, a sound of music. But this was all jumbled. The first thing that she knew clearly was that she had alighted and was standing under a thicket of trees close by the river side, and there, only a few feet away from her, was Scrubb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，陆地展现在她的正前方。她来到了一个河口。这会儿她飘得很低，离水面只有几英尺高了。一股浪峰溅到她脚趾上，溅起一大片泡沫，几乎把她腰以下都打得湿透了。这会儿她速度慢下来了，她没有被送到河面上，而是滑翔到她左面的河岸上。那儿要看的景物有好多好多，她简直都看不过来了，一片柔嫩的绿草地，一艘船，色彩鲜艳，看上去就像一大块珠宝，高塔和城墙，旗帜迎风招展，一大群人，衣着华丽，盔甲，金饰，刀剑，还有音乐声。但这些全都乱成一团。她首先清楚地知道的是她已经降落了，正站在靠近河边的一片灌木丛下，离她只有几英尺的地方就是斯克罗布。'">查看中文翻译</div>
