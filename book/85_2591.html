<div class="line_en">Eddie blinked, and found himself in a small, round room. The mountains were gone and so was the jade sky. A low plaster ceiling just missed his head. The room was brown -- as plain as shipping wrap -- and empty, save for a wooden stool and an oval mirror on the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪眨眨眼睛，发现自己身在一个窄小的环形房间里。山峦消失了，翡翠一样的天空也不见了踪影。灰泥天花板低低地垂在他的头顶上。房间是棕色的－－像包装纸一样单调的棕色－－除了一个木头凳子和墙上挂着的一面椭圆形镜子以外，别无他物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When did this start? Eddie thought. He touched his skin, which had aged since his time with Ruby. It felt thinner now, and drier. His midsection, which during his time with the Captain had felt tight as pulled rubber, was loose with flab, the droop of age.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是从什么时候开始的？爱迪心想。他摸摸自己的皮肤，比遇见鲁比时老化多了，变得更薄更干燥。他的上腹部，在见到上尉时还像拉紧的像胶一样绷得紧紧的，现在松松垮垮的，长着在老年人身体常见的一堆堆肥肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie stepped in front of the mirror. He cast no reflection. He saw only the reverse of the room, which expanded suddenly to include a row of doors. Eddie turned around. Then he coughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪走到镜子前面。他看不到自己的影子。他只看到镜中的房间忽然伸展开来，多出了一排门。爱迪转过身。然后，他咳嗽起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sound startled him, as if it came from someone else. He coughed again, a hard, rumbling cough, as if things needed to be resettled in his chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他吓了一跳，那声音好像是从别人嘴里发出来的。他又咳起来，一阵猛烈的、铿铿的咳嗽声。好像胸腔里的东西需要重新安顿下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are still two people for you to meet, Ruby had said. And then what? His lower back had a dull ache. His bad leg was growing stiffer. He realized what was happening, it happened with each new stage of heaven. He was rotting away.</div>

<div class="line_en">He approached one of the doors and pushed it open. Suddenly, he was outside, in the yard of a home he had never seen, in a land that he did not recognize, in the midst of what appeared to be a wedding reception. Guests holding silver plates filled the grassy lawn. At one end stood an archway covered in red flowers and birch branches, and at the other end, next to Eddie, stood the door that he had walked through. The bride, young and pretty, was in the center of the group, removing a pin from her butter-colored hair. The groom was lanky. He wore a black wedding coat and held up a sword, and at the hilt of the sword was a ring. He lowered it toward the bride and guests cheered as she took it. Eddie heard their voices, but the language was foreign. German? Swedish?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到一扇门前，把门推开。忽然，他来到了外面，来到了他不曾见过的一家人的院子里，采到了一片陌生的土地上。来到了显然是正在出席一场婚宴的人群之中，客人们端着银盘子站在草坪上。草坪一端是一条夜盖着红花和白桦树枝的拱廊，另一端，在爱迪身边，便是他走进来的那扇门。年轻漂亮的新娘站在一伙人中间，正从她那乳黄色的头发上把一个发夹拿下来。新郎身材修长，穿着一件黑色的礼服，手上举着一把剑，剑尖上钩着一枚戒指。他朝着新娘把剑摆平，新娘拿过戒指，客人们欢呼起来。爱迪听到了他们讲话的声音，但是，他们讲的是外语。德语？瑞典语？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He coughed again. The group looked up. Every person seemed to smile, and the smiling frightened Eddie. He backed quickly through the door from which he'd entered, figuring to return to the round room. Instead, he was in the middle of another wedding, indoors this time, in a large hall, where the people looked Spanish and the bride wore orange blossoms in her hair. She was dancing from one partner to the next, and each guest handed her a small sack of coins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又咳嗽起来。人们抬起头来。每个人似乎都在微笑，这微笑让爱迪感到恐惧。他迅速地退回他进来时通过的那扇门，以为会回到那个环形房间。然而，他却来到了另一场婚礼上，这一次，是在室内。在一个大厅里，好像都是西班牙人，新娘的头上戴着香橙花。她跳着舞，从一个舞伴移到另一个舞伴跟前，每个客人都递给她一小袋零钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie coughed again -- he couldn't help it -- and when several of the guests looked up, he backed through the door and again entered a different wedding scene, something African, Eddie guessed, where families poured wine onto the ground and the couple held hands and jumped over a broom. Then another pass through the door to a Chinese reception, where firecrackers were lit before cheering attendees, then another doorway to something else -- maybe French?-- where the couple drank together from a two-handled cup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪又咳嗽起来－－他忍不住－－几个客人抬起头来，他通进门去，又来到了另一场截然不同的婚礼，爱迪估计是非洲式的，家人把酒洒在地上。新婚夫妇手拉着手从一把扫帚上跳过。然后，经过那扇门，他又来到了一场中国婚礼上，烟花四起，人群欢悦。然后，另一扇门，另一个场景－－大概是法国式l的？－－一对夫妇正在一起从一只双柄杯子里喝东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How long does this go on? Eddie thought. In each reception, there were no signs of how the people had gotten there, no cars or buses, no wagons, no horses. Departure did not appear to be an issue. The guests milled about, and Eddie was absorbed as one of them, smiled at but never spoken to, much like the handful of weddings he had gone to on earth. He preferred it that way. Weddings were, in Eddie's mind, too full of embarrassing moments, like when couples were asked to join in a dance, or to help lift the bride in a chair. His bad leg seemed to glow at those moments, and he felt as if people could see it from across the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怎么没完没了呀？爱迪心想。在每一场婚礼上，都没有迹象表明人们是怎么来的，没有汽车，没有巴士，没有马车，没有马。离开似乎也不成问题。客人们转来转去，爱迪融合在他们中间，人们朝他微笑，但没人眼他讲话，就像他在世时去过的少数几次婚礼一样。他喜欢这样。在爱迪的心目中，婚礼上尽是令人尴尬的场面，比如夫妇们被邀请一起跳舞，或者帮忙用椅子把新娘抬起来。他的那条坏腿这时候特别显眼，他觉得房间对面的人好像都能看到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Because of that, Eddie avoided most receptions, and when he did go, he often stood in the parking lot, smoking a cigarette, waiting for time to pass. For a long stretch, there were no weddings to attend, anyhow. Only in the late years of his life, when some of his teenaged pier workers had grown up and taken spouses, did he find himself getting the faded suit out of the closet and putting on the collared shirt that pinched his thick neck. By this point, his once-fractured leg bones were spurred and deformed. Arthritis had invaded his knee. He limped badly and was thus excused from all participatory moments, such as dances or candle lightings. He was considered an "old man," alone, unattached, and no one expected him to do much besides smile when the photographer came to the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正因为如此，爱迪回避了大多数婚礼，即使去了，他也时常站在停车场里，抽烟打发时间。在好长一段时间里，例也没有婚礼可参加。只是到了晚年，一起工作的年轻人长大了，开始谈婚论嫁，他才把褪了色的西装从壁橱里翻出来，穿上会卡痛他的粗脖子的圈领衬衫。这时候，他曾经断过的腿骨已经变形。关节炎侵袭了他的膝盖。他跳得很厉害，所以不用参加跳舞或者点蜡烛之类的活动。他被认为是一个“老人”，独自一人，跟谁都没有瓜葛，除了摄影师来到桌子跟前时他需要微笑以外，没有人指望他做任何事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here, now, in his maintenance clothes, he moved from one wedding to the next, one reception to another, one language, one cake, and one type of music to another language, another cake, and another type of music. The uniformity did not surprise Eddie. He always figured a wedding here was not much different from a wedding there. What he didn't get was what this had to do with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这会儿。他穿着一身维修工作服，从一场婚礼到另一场婚礼，从一个宴会到另一个宴会，从一种语言、一只蛋糕、一段音乐到另一种语言、另一只蛋糕和另一段音乐。婚礼的一致性并没有让爱迪感到吃惊。他一直认为，这里的婚礼和那里的婚礼不会有太大的分别。他搞不明白的是，这跟他有什么关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pushed through the threshold one more time and found himself in what appeared to be an Italian village. There were vineyards on the hillsides and farmhouses of travertine stone. Many of the men had thick, black hair, combed back and wet, and the women had dark eyes and sharp features. Eddie found a place against a wall and watched the bride and groom cut a log in half with a two-handed rip saw. Music played -- flutists, violinists, guitarists -- and guests began the tarantella, dancing in a wild, twirling rhythm. Eddie took a few steps back. His eyes wandered to the edge of the crowd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又跨过一个门槛，发现自己来到了一个像是意大利人住的村子里。山坡上是葡萄园，还有用钙华石建成的农舍。许多男人长着浓密的黑发，都湿湿地向后梳着，女人们长着乌黑的眼睛，面目轮廓分明。爱迪找了个靠墙的地方站定，望着新娘和新郎用一把双柄粗齿锯把一根木头锯成两截。音乐声响起－笛子、小提琴、吉他－－客人们跳起了塔兰台拉舞，他们在奔放的旋律中飞旋。爱迪退后几步。他将目光游移到人群的边缘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A bridesmaid in a long lavender dress and a stitched straw hat moved through the guests, with a basket of candy-covered almonds. From afar, she looked to be in her 20s.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the sound of her voice, Eddie's whole body shook. He began to sweat. Something told him to run, but something else froze his feet to the ground. She came his way. Her eyes found him from beneath the hat brim, which was topped with parchment flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一听到她的声音，爱迪浑身一颤。他开始冒汗。他想逃走，但他的两只脚却僵立在地上。她朝他这方向走过来。她的一双眼睛从戴着纸花的帽檐下面看到了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
