<div class="line_en">It was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I ran as fast as I could," he said, sitting down and yawning, "but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?" Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我尽我的力量跑，”它说着，坐起来，打着呵欠，“但是花的香气毒得我太厉害了。你们怎么把我救出来的？”于是他们告诉它：是田鼠们，怎样勇敢地把它从死亡里救了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此狮子听了，振作精神，重新清醒起来，它和大家一起动身上路，在柔软的新鲜的草地上，十分愉快地走着。不久，他们到达了黄砖铺砌的路，再转向伟大的奥芝所住的翡翠城走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," answered the Scarecrow. "Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I'm afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稻草人回答说：“是的，这里什么东西都是绿的，在那芒奇金人的国里，蓝是他们喜爱的颜色。但是，这里的人，似乎没有像芒奇金人那般友好，我担忧我们将不能找到一个地方过夜。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，路是光滑而且平坦，四周的景色也美丽起来了。所以这些旅行者们，很庆幸他们已经远远地离开了森林，以及在那阴沉的暗影里所遇到的许多危险。他们又看见，筑在路旁边的一些墙垣，不过它们都漆着绿的颜色。当他们跑到一间有个农民住在里头的小屋子那里，那间小屋子也漆着绿色。在这一个下午，他们经过了好几所这样的屋子，有时候居民跑到门口来看他们，好像预备要问一些问题。但是没有一个向他们跑近来，也没有一个对他们说话，因为那只大狮子叫他们十分害怕。那些人们都穿着一种可受的翠绿色的衣裳，还戴着像那些芒奇金人那样的尖顶帽子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the door and knocked. A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, "What do you want, child, and why is that great Lion with you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，当他们走到一所不大不小的农舍旁边，多萝茜大胆地走上前去敲门。一个妇人只把门打开一条缝，开得可以望见她，说道：“孩子，你要什么，为什么带着一只大狮子在一起？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I should like something to eat besides fruit," said the girl, "and I'm sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除了果子以外，我必须吃一些东西，”女孩子说，“我相信托托差不多也饿了。让我们在下一所屋子旁停下来，好向居民们商量商量。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“它可是养驯了的吗？”妇人问，把门开大了一点儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Lion, "if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妇人在仔细地想了一想以后，又窥视了一下狮子说：“好，如果这是实在的情形，你们可以进来，我给你们吃一顿晚饭，并且有一个睡觉的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes," said the girl, "and he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，是的，”女孩子说，“它又是一个最最胆小的。所以它怕你，比你怕它更加厉害。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked: "Where are you all going?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此他们一起进了屋子，那里除了妇人以外，住着两个小孩子和一个男人。那男人伤了腿，躺在角落里的一张床上。他们看见来了这样一个奇怪的团体，非常地诧异。当那妇人忙碌着安放桌子时，那男人问道：“你们一块儿上哪里去？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么不能？”她回答说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，据说他从来不让任何人走近他的面前。我去过翡翠城许多次，那是一处美丽的奇异的地方。但是我从来不曾被允许去见伟大的奥芝，我也知道不论哪个人，都不曾看见过他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is hard to tell," said the man thoughtfully. "You see, Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那可难说了，”男人沉思地说，“你要明白，奥芝是一个伟大的魔术家，他能够随心所欲地变成什么样子。因此有人说他的样子像一只鸟；有人说他的样子像一只象；有人说他的样子像一只猫。对着另一些人，他像一个美丽的神仙出现着，或者像一个小神仙，或者他喜欢什么样子就是什么样子。但是真正的奥芝，他自身的样子，没有一个人能够说得出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在妇人招呼他们，晚饭预备好了。于是他们围集在桌子旁，多萝茜吃了一些可口的燕麦粥，一碟子炒蛋，和一盆子精白面包，她吃得非常高兴。狮子吃了一些燕麦粥，但是它并不喜欢吃，说这是用雀麦做的，雀麦是马吃的东西，不是给狮子吃的。稻草人和铁皮人什么都不吃。托托把每一种东西都吃一点儿。它很快活地又吃到了一顿美好的晚饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
