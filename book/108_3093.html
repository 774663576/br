<div class="line_en">Ove has put on his best trousers and his going-out shirt. Carefully he covers the floor with a protective sheet of plastic, as if protecting a valuable work of art. Not that the floor is particularly new (although he did sand it less than two years ago). He's fairly sure that you don't lose much blood when you hang yourself, and it isn't because of worries about the dust or the drilling. Or the marks when he kicks away the stool. In fact he's glued some plastic pads to the bottoms of its legs, so there shouldn't be any marks at all. No, the heavy-duty sheets of plastic which Ove so carefully unfolds, covering the entire hall, living room, and a good part of the kitchen, are not for Ove's own sake at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">You miss the strangest things when you lose someone. Little things. Smiles. The way she turned over in her sleep. Even repainting a room for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="失去某人以后总是会有一些奇怪的细节惹人怀念。都是极小的事情。笑容、她睡眠时翻身的样子。为她粉刷房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove goes to get his box of drill bits. These are single-handedly the most important things when drilling. Not the drill, but the bits. It's like having proper tires on your car instead of messing about with ceramic brakes and nonsense like that. Anyone who knows anything knows that. Ove positions himself in the middle of the room and sizes it up. Then, like a surgeon gazing down on his instruments, his eyes move searchingly over his drill bits. He selects one, slots it into the drill, and tests the trigger a little so that the drill makes a growling sound. Shakes his head, decides that it doesn't feel at all right, and changes the drill bit. He repeats this four times before he's satisfied, then walks through the living room, swinging the drill from his hand like a big revolver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维拿来装钻头的盒子。这是钻洞时唯一最重要的部件。没有钻头，没法钻洞，就像汽车需要合适的轮胎，而不是什么陶瓷刹车片之类没用的东西一样。懂点事的人都知道。欧维站在房间中央目测着，用眼睛挑选钻头，如同外科大夫用眼睛挑选手术刀。他挑出一个来，装进冲击钻里，试探性地让钻机隆隆转起来。摇摇头，感觉不对头，换钻头。他这么做了四次才满意，然后摇摆着电钻走进客厅，就像拿着一把大号左轮手枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He puts the stool in the middle of the floor. It's coated in at least seven different layers of paint. Ove's wife decided on principle that she'd let Ove repaint one of the rooms in their house every six months. Or, to be more exact, she decided she wanted a different color in one of the rooms once every six months. And when she said as much to Ove he told her that she might as well forget it. And then she called a decorator for an estimate. And then she told Ove how much she was going to pay the decorator. And then Ove went to fetch his painting stool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把凳子放到地板中央。这张凳子起码上过七层不同颜色的油漆。欧维太太决定让欧维在排屋里任选一个房间每半年上一遍油漆。或者，说得更贴切一点，她想要这一个房间每半年变一次颜色。她这样对欧维说时，欧维让她别做梦了。于是她打电话找了个粉刷匠，让他报个价。然后她告诉欧维她打算付给粉刷匠多少钱，再然后欧维就起身拿刷子去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove steps down from the stool. Walks around to make sure the protective plastic is in position as it should be. Unlocks the door so they won't have to break it down when they come to get him. It's a good door. It'll last many more years.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="于是他又去拿来一把卷尺，四个角都量了。为了保证万无一失还量了两遍，并在天花板正中心标了个小叉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stands in the middle of the floor staring up at the ceiling. He has to measure this before he gets started, he realizes. So that the hole is centered. The worst thing Ove knows is when someone just drills a hole in the ceiling, hit-or-miss.</div>

<div class="line_en">He puts on his suit jacket and checks that the envelope is in his inside pocket. Finally he turns the photo of his wife in the window, so that it looks out towards the shed. He doesn't want to make her watch what he's about to do, but on the other hand he daren't put the photograph facedown either. Ove's wife was always horribly ill-tempered if they ever ended up in someplace without a view. She needed "something to look at that's alive," she was always saying. So he points her towards the shed while thinking that maybe that Cat Annoyance would come by again. Ove's wife liked Cat Annoyances.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他穿上外套，检查了一下信封是不是还在内侧袋里。最后他把窗台上太太的照片翻了个面，让它面朝储藏室。他不想让她看着他动手。他也不想让她面朝下。每次他们落入什么封闭的空间，欧维的太太都会非常恼火。她“需要看到些生气”，她总是这么说。所以他让她面对储藏室。他想猫崽子可能还会跳出来。欧维的太太反正也挺喜欢猫崽子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The third time Ove stops drilling and glares at the door. As if he may be able to convince whoever is standing outside to disappear by his mental powers alone. It doesn't work. The person in question obviously thinks the only rational explanation for his not opening the door the first time around was that he did not hear the doorbell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门铃第三次响起，欧维放下电钻愤怒地瞪着门。就像他可以用意念说服门口的人自动消失。效果不是很明显。门口的人显然认为，第一次铃响时没人出来开门的唯一合理解释，是他没有听见铃声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我是说其实这事没什么好谢的，成年人都应该可以自己倒拖斗车。”盲流看着他，就像他也不是很肯定这到底算不算侮辱。欧维决定不帮他这个忙，他后退着又打算关门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe you're right, Ove. But anyway, he's very sick now… so it doesn't really matter anymore." Her bottom lip trembles slightly. Then she regains her composure, straightens her neck with dignity, and clears her throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不懂不懂，欧维很可能是对的。但无论如何他现在都病得不轻了……这已经没什么关系了。”她嘴唇下方的皮肤开始颤抖，但她马上振作起来，重新骄傲地仰起头，清了清嗓子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He sinks down on the stool, breathing heavily. His hands are still shaking as if he were standing waist-deep in ice-cold water. His chest thumps. It happens more and more these days. He has to sort of struggle for a mouthful of air, like a fish in an overturned bowl. His company doctor said it was chronic, and that he mustn't work himself up. Easy for him to say.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove is not sure how long he stays there on the stool, sitting with the drill in his hand and his heart beating so hard that he feels the pulse inside his head. There's a photo on the wall beside the front door, of Ove and Sonja. It's almost forty years old. That time they were in Spain on a bus tour. She's suntanned, wearing a red dress, and looking so happy. Ove is standing next to her, holding her hand. He sits there for what must be an hour, just staring at that photo. Of all the imaginable things he most misses about her, the thing he really wishes he could do again is hold her hand in his. She had a way of folding her index finger into his palm, hiding it inside. And he always felt that nothing in the world was impossible when she did that. Of all the things he could miss, that's what he misses most.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维也不知道自己拿着冲击钻在凳子上坐了多久，心脏怦怦跳着，能感觉到脑袋里的脉动。大门边的墙上挂着一张照片，是欧维和他太太的。索雅。照片有将近四十年了，那是他们在西班牙搭公车时照的。她穿一件红色的衣服，皮肤晒得黝黑，看上去很快乐。欧维站在她身边，握着她的手。欧维坐在那儿大约一个小时，就一直盯着这张照片。诚然她有那么多值得思念的时刻，但他真希望能再次就这样握着她的手。她喜欢把她的食指裹在掌心里，藏在那儿的缝隙里。她这样做的时候，他就觉得这世上其实没有什么不可能做到的事。所有值得他怀念的事情中，这最让他耿耿于怀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good to go home and have a rest now," said his bosses at work. "Now your heart is playing up and all." They called it "early retirement" but they might as well have said what it was: "liquidation." A third of a century in the same job and that's what they reduced him to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“回家休息休息多好，”公司老板说，“你心脏出了点小毛病。”他们称之为早退，但还不如说是清理门户，欧维想。三分之一个世纪都在同一个岗位上工作，如今他们居然因所谓的“小毛病”而为难他。">查看中文翻译</div>
