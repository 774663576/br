<div class="line_en">She saw that, much as Howl deserved it, she had been taking out her feelings on the castle when she was really angry with the Witch of the Waste. And she was a little upset at the thought that she was here on false pretenses. Howl might think Calcifer liked her, but Sophie knew Calcifer had simply seized on a chance to make a bargain with her. Sophie rather thought she had let Calcifer down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她现在想明白了，虽然哈尔是罪有应得，但她生气的对象其实是女巫。这些天以来，她把对女巫的怒气全发泄在城堡上，她对自己以欺骗的手法待在这里，也觉得有些良心不安。哈尔或许认为卡西法喜欢她，但是苏菲知道，卡西法不过是抓住机会跟她谈一笔交易而已。苏菲觉得自己辜负了卡西法的期待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This state of mind did not last. Sophie discovered a pile of Michael's clothes that needed mending. She fetched out thimble, scissors, and thread from her sewing pocket and set to work. By that evening she was cheerful enough to join in Calcifer's silly little song about saucepans.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the bench Howl worked a good deal harder and faster than Michael, putting spells together in an expert but slapdash way. From the look on Michael's face, most of the spells were both unusual and hard to do. But Howl would leave a spell midway and dash up to his bedroom to look after something hidden -- and no doubt sinister -- going on up there, and then shortly race out into the yard to tinker with a large spell out there. Sophie opened the door a crack and was rather amazed to see the elegant wizard kneeling in the mud with his long sleeves tied behind his neck to keep them out of the way while he carefully heaved a tangle of greasy metal into a special framework of some kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在工作台那儿，哈尔做的比麦可努力，而且快速。以一种专业但又十分随便的态度，将咒语组合在一起。由麦可的表情看来，大部分的咒语不仅不寻常，而且很难。但是哈尔常做到一半就跑掉，冲上楼，到房里去找东西（当然一定是邪恶的东西），不一会儿，又冲到院子里去把弄一个大的咒语。苏菲将门打开一点缝隙偷瞧，很惊讶地看到这个外表优雅的巫师居然跪在泥地，长袖绑在脖子后头以免妨碍工作。他小心地举起一堆纠缠在一起的金属，将它们变成某种东西的骨架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was clear Howl had not yet caught the girl he was after. Sophie listened to Michael asking rather obvious questions about it, and Howl slithering neatly out of answering any of them. "He is a slitherer-outer," Sophie murmured to a pair of Michael's socks. "Can't face his own wickedness." She watched Howl being restlessly busy in order to hide his discontent. That was something Sophie understood rather well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔显然还没抓到他锁定的女孩，苏菲听到麦可问他一些很明显的相关问题，但是哈尔总是很滑溜地避免回答。“真是个泥鳅大王！”苏菲对一双麦可的袜子喃喃地说：“不能面对自己的邪恶。”她看着哈尔心神不宁地忙着，试着掩饰他的不满。这样的情绪，苏菲倒是颇能了解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He wasn't as inventive as you, by all accounts," Michael said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“苏利曼绝对不如你有创造力。”麦可说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm too patient and polite," Howl said gloomily. "I should have overcharged him even more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我呢，是太有耐心又太客气了！”哈尔沮丧地说：“我应该跟他狠狠敲一笔的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is a bit ominous," Howl said to Michael when the messenger had gone. "What did Suliman have to get himself lost in the Waste for? The King seems to think I'll do instead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“事情有点不太妙，”信差走后，哈尔跟麦可说：“苏利曼干吗要跑到荒地失踪不见？现在国王似乎认定我可以接续他的工作。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That spell was for the King. Another overdressed and scented messenger arrived with a letter and a long, long speech in which he wondered if Howl could possibly spare time, no doubt invaluably employed in other ways, to bend his powerful and ingenious mind to a small problem experienced by His Royal Majesty -- to whit, how an army might get its heavy wagons through a marsh and rough ground. Howl was wonderfully polite and long-winded in reply. He said no. But the messenger spoke for a further half-hour, at then end of which he and Howl bowed to one another and Howl agreed to do the spell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个咒语是为国王做的。一位打扮过度、身上洒满香水的传讯者，带着国王的信和长长的说辞到来。他说哈尔必然有许多其他重要顾客的工作要做，但不知是否能拨出时间，将他能力强大、善于发明的脑力，稍稍用在国王所遭逢的一个小问题上？也就是说呢，国王陛下想知道，如何能让沉重的货车经过沼泽区和崎岖不平的路面。哈尔的回答同样非常彬彬有礼，又臭又长。他拒绝了，但是信差又讲了半个钟头。最后，他和哈尔互相行礼，哈尔同意弄那个咒语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl was equally patient and polite with customers from Porthaven, but, as Michael anxiously pointed out, the trouble was that Howl did not charge these people enough. This was after Howl had listened for an hour to the reasons why a seaman's wife could not pay him a penny yet, and then promised a sea captain a wind spell for almost nothing. Howl eluded Michael's arguments by giving him a magic lesson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实哈尔对避难港的客人也同样耐心而客气，但是麦可焦虑地指出，问题在于哈尔对这些人的收费实在太低。麦可这些牢骚是在哈尔耐心花上一个小时倾听一个渔夫太太解释说，为何她还不能付他一分钱；随后又几乎免费地为某个船长弄风咒语后忍不住说的。哈尔逃避麦可唠叨的方法是给他上魔法课。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie sewed buttons on Michael's shirts and listened to Howl going through a spell with Michael. "I know I'm slapdash," he was saying, "but there's no need for you to copy me. Always read it right through, carefully, first. The shape of it should tell you a lot, whether it's self-fulfilling, or self-discovering, or simple incantation, or mixed action and speech. When you've decided that, go through again and decide which bits mean what they say and which bits are put as a puzzle. You're getting on to more powerful kinds now. You'll find every spell of power has at least one deliberate mistake or mystery in it to prevent accidents. You have to spot those. Now take this spell…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲边在麦可的衬衫上面缝扣子，边听哈尔跟麦可从头讲解一个咒语。“我知道我这样讲似乎有些草率，”哈尔说：“但是你真的无需抄袭无。记住，永远都要先小心地读一遍。它的形状应该会透露许多讯息：看它是会自我完成、自我发现，或者本身就是个简单魔法，还是需要混合行动和语言？等你决定后，回头再读一遍，然后决定哪个部分说的是真的，哪个部分只是故意放在那里困惑人的。你现在已逐渐接触到比较高阶的魔法，你会发现每个有力的魔法都至少有一个故意植入的错误或迷题，以避免以外发生，你必须将它找出来。现在，就拿这个咒语来说…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Listening to Michael's halting replies to Howl's questions, and watching Howl scribble remarks on the paper with a strange, everlasting quill pen, Sophie realized that she could learn a lot too. It dawned on her that if Martha could discover the spell to swap herself and Lettie about at Mrs. Fairfax's, then she ought to be able to do the same here. With a bit of luck, there might be no need to rely on Calcifer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听着麦可对哈尔提出的问题犹豫地回答，看着哈尔以一支样式奇特、永远不用添加墨汁的鹅毛笔在纸上潦草地写下短评，苏菲发现她也能从中学到许多。她突然想到，若玛莎可以在菲菲克丝太太那里找到将自己和乐蒂变为对方的咒语，她也应该能在这里办到。运气好的话，也许根本不需要卡西法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Howl was satisfied that Michael had forgotten all about how much or how little he charged people in Porthaven, he took him out into the yard to help with the King's spell. Sophie creaked to her feet and hobbled to the bench. The spell was clear enough, but Howl's scrawled remarks defeated her. "I've never seen such writing!" she grumbled to the human skull. "Does he use a pen or a poker?" She sorted eagerly through every scrap of paper on the bench and examined the powders and liquids in the crooked jars. "Yes, let's admit it," she told the skull. "I snoop. And I have my proper reward. I can find out how to cure fowl pest and abate whooping cough, raise a wind and remove hairs from the face. If Martha had found this lot, she'd still be at Mrs. Fairfax's."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当哈尔确定麦可终于忘记他跟避难港的人的收费问题时，他带他到后院去帮忙弄国王要的咒语。苏菲站起来，蹒跚地走到工作台。咒语写得倒是很清楚，但她完全败给哈尔那一笔草字。“没看过字是这样写的！”她对骷髅头抱怨：“他是用笔还是用火钳写字？”她热切地翻阅工作台上所有的纸片，检视那些放在形状扭曲瓶里的粉末和液体。“是的，我承认，”她跟骷髅头说：“我在探人隐私，也略有收获。我找到了治疗鸡瘟及百日咳的方法，还有唤来一阵风，以及除去脸毛的方法。如果玛莎找到的是这些，她现在一定还待在菲菲克丝太太那里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl, it seemed to Sophie, went and examined all the things she had moved when he came in from the yard. But that seemed to be only restlessness. He seemed not to know what to do with himself after that. Sophie heard him roving up and down during the night. He was only an hour in the bathroom the next morning. He seemed not to be able to contain himself while Michael put on his best plum velvet suit, ready to go to the Palace in Kingsbury, and the two of them wrapped the bulky spell up in golden paper. The spell must have been surprisingly light for its size. Michael could carry it on his own easily, with both is arms wrapped round it. Howl turned the knob over the door red-down for him and sent him out into the street among the painted houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔近来后，似乎检查了所有被苏菲动过的东西，但动机几乎肇因与他静不下心。在那之后，他似乎不知道该做什么才好，苏菲听到他夜里上上下下地徘徊。第二天早晨，他只在浴室里待一个钟头。当麦可穿上他最好的紫蓝色丝绒服，准备前往位于金斯别利城的王宫时，哈尔一副迫不及待的样子。他们两人合力将体积大的符咒用金纸包起来，依它的体积看来，那符咒显然非常的轻，麦可一个人就可以轻易拿起来。麦可两手合抱着包裹，哈尔为他开门，将门把转到红色向下，送他到房子皆粉刷得光鲜亮丽的街道上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie found a gray-and-scarlet suit, as fancy as the blue-and-silver one, dropped into her lap from nowhere. Howl meanwhile picked up his guitar from its corner, turned the doorknob green-down, and stepped out among the scudding heather above Market Chipping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲不知从哪里弄来一件和那件蓝银色套装一样时髦的灰色及大红色的套装，丢到膝上。哈尔由墙角拿起吉他，将门转到绿色向下，一脚踏在马克奇平上空飞掠的石楠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shut the door and roved around the room again. "My feet itch," he said suddenly. "I'm going for a walk on the hills. Tell Michael the spell I promised him is on the bench. And here's for you to keep busy with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他关上门，然后又开始在房里来来回回走动。“我的脚会痒，”他突然说：“我要去山岗那儿走一走。告诉麦可，要给他的咒语放在工作台上。还有这个，你这样才不会无聊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They're expecting it," Howl said. "You should only have to wait most of the morning. Tell them a child could work it. Show them. And when you come back, I'll have a spell of power for you to get to work on. So long."</div>

<div class="line_en">"His feet itch!" grumbled Calcifer. There was a fog down in Porthaven., Calcifer was low among his logs, moving uneasily this way and that to avoid drips in the chimney. "How does he think I feel, stuck in a damp grate like this?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他脚痒，亏他说得出口！”卡西法咕哝着。避难港有雾，卡西法在木头里蹲得低低的，不安地晃来晃去，躲避由烟囱滴下来的水滴。“他以为我是什么感觉？困在这样湿漉漉的炉架里！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Sophie furled up her sleeves, bent her back to get a good purchase on the Wizard's slimy knees, and pushed Howl, stool and all, toward the bathroom. Her feet slipped and skidded in the slime, but of course the ooziness helped the stool to move too. Michael came and pulled at Howl's slime-draped sleeves.

Sophie told Michael to put it in the bath to soak. Meanwhile, mumbling and grumbling, she fetched more hot water. She turned the doorknob green-down and swept all the slime out onto the moors. The castle left a trail like a snail in the heather, but it was an easy way to get rid of the slime. There were some advantages to living in a moving castle, Sophie thought as she washed the floor.

<div class="line_en">Howl sipped the milk dolefully. "Yes," he said. "I left her alone to see if that would make her remember me fondly, and it hasn't. She wasn't sure, even when I last saw her. Now she tells me there's another fellow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔可怜兮兮地嗫饮着牛奶。“是的，”他说：“我故意离开她几天，看她会不会想我，结果没有，上次见到她时，她已经说她不确定了，这次却告诉我还有另外一个人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie's sympathy shrank quite sharply. It occurred to her that if Howl could cover himself with green slime so easily, then he could just as easily turn his hair the proper color. "Then why don't you feed the girl a love potion and get it over with?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲的同情心一下子大大缩水。她突然想到，如果哈尔能那么轻易地将自己盖满绿色黏液，他应该也很容易就能将自己的头发变回他想要的颜色。“那你干吗不调制一种爱情药，喂她吃下，然后把事情解决掉。”她问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, no," said Howl. "That's not playing the game. That would spoil all the fun."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，那不行，”哈尔说：“那就违反游戏规则了，那会破坏一切乐趣。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl finished the milk and gazed into the mug with a sentimental smile. "I think of her all the time," he said. "Lovely, lovely Lettie Hatter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔喝完牛奶，带着多情的微笑凝视着杯子。“我整天想她，”他说：“可爱的、可爱的乐蒂。海特。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's the most beautiful girl there ever was in these parts," Howl went on mournfully. "I love her so dearly, but she scorns my deep devotion and gets sorry for another fellow. How can she have another fellow after all this attention I've given her? They usually get rid of the other fellows as soon as I come along."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是我在这些地方里所见过最美丽的女子，”哈尔悲伤地往下说：“我非常爱她。但是她对我的深情嗤之以鼻，反而同情另一个家伙。在我对她这么好之后，她怎能接受别人呢？通常我一出现，她们就会把另一个人甩了的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie's sympathy went for good, with a sharp bang. A good deal of anxiety took its place. Oh, Martha! she thought. You have been busy! So it wasn't anyone in Cesari's you were talking about!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲的同情心就这么再见了，代之而起的是许多焦虑。“噢，玛莎！”她想着：“你说你一直忙着！原来你说的不是在希赛利工作的人啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie's sympathy shrank again. A game, was it? "Don't you ever give a thought for the poor girl?" she snapped.</div>
