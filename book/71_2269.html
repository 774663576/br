<div class="line_en">If the Count of Monte Cristo had lived longer in Parisian society, he would have been able to appreciate the full significance of M. de Villefort's gesture towards him. In favour at court, regardless of whether the reigning monarch belonged to the senior or junior branch of the royal family, and whether the government of the day was doctrinaire, liberal or conservative; considered able by all, as people usually are when they have never suffered a political reverse, hated by many but eagerly protected by a few, though not loved by anyone, M. de Villefort occupied a high position in the judiciary and remained at that height by the same means as a Harlay or a Molé. His salon, though enlivened by a young wife and a daughter from his first marriage who was barely eighteen years old, was nonetheless one of those strict Parisian salons which worship tradition and observe the religion of etiquette. Frigid good manners, absolute fidelity to the principles of the government in power, a profound contempt for theory and theoreticians, and a deep hatred of ideologues made up the elements of his public and private life that M. de Villefort exhibited to the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomat. His connection with the old court, about which he always spoke with dignity and deference, gained him the respect of the new regime; he knew so much that not only was he always treated with tact but was even asked for his advice from time to time. Things might have been different, had it been possible to get rid of M. de Villefort, but -- like a feudal baron in revolt against his monarch -- he occupied an impregnable fortress. This was his post as crown prosecutor; he exploited all the advantages of his position and would have left it only to go into parliament, thus replacing neutrality with opposition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福先生不但是一位法官，而且几乎是一位外交家。他和前朝的关系使他得到了当今的尊重，他每讲到前朝，总是显出庄严恭敬的态度，而他所知道的事情是这样的多，所以他不但始终受到恭谨的重视，而且有时还承蒙谘商。要是人们能除掉维尔福先生的话，情形或许就不会如此的了，但象违抗国王的封建诸侯一样，他住在一个无法攻陷的堡垒里。这个堡垒就是他当检察官这个职位。他极其巧妙地发挥了这个职位所占的种种优势，他决不辞职，至多只请人暂时代理一下，借此避免处于反对的地位而保守中立。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the whole, M. de Villefort made and returned few visits. His wife visited on his behalf: this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business -- when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance, an extreme example of aristocratic contempt, in short, the application of the maxim: "Admire yourself and others will admire you", a hundred times more useful in our days than the Greek one: "Know thyself", which has now been replaced by the less demanding and more profitable art of knowing others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福先生通常极少出去拜客，也极少回拜。他的妻子代他拜客，而且这已是社会上所公认的事，他们以为法官的职务繁重而谅解他，而实际上他却只是出于一种骄傲的打算，这正是贵族的本质——的确，他应用了“只要自以为你了不起，旁人也就会以为你了不起”这句格言，这句格言在我们的社会里实在比希腊人的那句：“认识你自己，”更有用一百倍，——我们却是用那比较省力而更有利的“认识旁人”的学问取代了希腊人的这句格言了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least trivial-minded man in France. He gave a ball every year, showing his face in it for a mere quarter of an hour, that is to say, forty-five minutes less than the time the king spends in his balls. He was never seen at the theatre, at a concert or in any public place. Sometimes (but rarely) he would play a hand at whist, and on such occasions they were careful to choose players worthy of him: some ambassador or other, an archbishop, a prince, a president or some dowager duchess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福先生一向是以法国最不好奇和最不怕烦劳的人见称。他每年开一次舞会，在那次跳舞会里，他只出现一刻钟——那就是说，比国王开跳舞会时露面的时间还少四十五分钟。他从来不到戏院，音乐会，或任何公共娱乐的场所。偶而，但这种时候也很少的，他会玩玩威斯特牌戏①；而那时他必定小心挑选够格和他一起玩的牌友——如大使、大主教、亲王、总统或寡居的公爵夫人之流。【注：①一种扑克牌的游戏。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies, a silent but relentless adversary; to those who were neither, he was the statue of the law made flesh. Haughty in manner, impassive in expression, with eyes that were either dull and lifeless, or insolently penetrating and enquiring: this was the man whom four revolutions, neatly stacked one on top of the other, had first elevated, then cemented to his pedestal.</div>

<div class="line_en">The crown prosecutor entered with the same heavy, measured tread that he would adopt on entering court. This was indeed the same man or, rather, the continuation of the same man, whom we met earlier as a substitut in Marseille. Nature, consistent with its principles, had changed nothing in the course laid down for him: once slim, he was now thin; once pale, he was now yellow. His deep-set eyes were hollow and his gold-rimmed spectacles, resting in the sockets, seemed to be part of the face. Apart from his white tie, the remainder of his dress was entirely black and this funereal colour was broken only by the fine strip of red ribbon imperceptibly threaded through his buttonhole, like a line of blood painted with a brush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="检察官用他步入法庭时同样庄重和合度的步伐走了进来。他以前在马赛当代理检察官时我们曾见过他，还是那个人，说得更正确些，是原来那个人达到了最完美的阶段。“自然”照例在他的身上造成了某些变化，但它在改变他的过程中却毫未使他走样。他从消瘦变成了羸瘠，从苍白变成了焦黄；他那深陷的眼睛现在凹得更深了；他那一副金边眼镜，架在鼻子上的时候，似乎成了他脸上的一部分。他的全身服饰都是黑的，只有领带是白的。这一身打扮惟一不同于丧服的地方，就是穿在纽孔上的那一条几乎难以觉察的红丝带，象是用铅笔划出来的一缕血丝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though he gave no sign of any other emotion in returning his greeting, Monte Cristo examined the magistrate with visible curiosity. The other man, habitually cautious and, above all, incredulous where fashionable marvels were concerned, was more inclined to see in the Noble Foreigner (as people had already started to call Monte Cristo) some knight of industry who had come to expand into new realms, or an outlaw creeping back into society, than a prince of the Holy See or a sultan of the Thousand and One Nights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山虽然极能自制，这时，他在还礼以后，竟也带着抑制不住的好奇心仔细观察起这位法官，而对方是一向有怀疑的习惯的，尤其更不相信社会上有所谓奇人奇事，所以也极想看出这位外国贵宾（已经有人这样称呼基督山）究竟是一个转移阵地一显身手的大骗子或不法之徒呢，还是一个来自圣海的王子或《一千〇一夜》里的苏丹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Monsieur," he said, with that hectoring tone that advocates adopt for addressing the courtroom, and which they are unable or unwilling to set aside in normal conversation, "the notable service that you performed yesterday for my wife and son has put me under an obligation to thank you. I have therefore come to accomplish this duty and to express my gratitude to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阁下，”维尔福说，说话的口吻和法官在演讲的时候一样，象是在社交的场合也不能或不愿放弃这种腔调似的，“阁下，昨天蒙您大力帮忙，拯救我的妻子和儿子，我觉得我有向您道谢的义务。所以，请允许我履行这个义务，让我对您表达我衷心的感激。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Monsieur," the count replied, in a voice of icy coldness, "I am very happy at having been able to preserve a son for his mother, for they say that the feeling of maternal love is the holiest of all; and my enjoyment of this happiness released you, Monsieur, from the necessity of fulfilling a duty, the accomplishment of which undoubtedly flatters me, knowing as I do that Monsieur de Villefort is not prodigal with the honour that he does me, but which, precious though it may be, is less valuable to me than my sense of inner satisfaction."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阁下，”伯爵冷冰冰地回答说，“我非常高兴能有机会为一个母亲保全了她的儿子——因为常言说，母子之情是世界上最神圣的情感，而我的好运，阁下，使您须履行一种义务，而您在履行那种义务的时候，无疑的给对方以莫大的光荣——因为我知道，维尔福先生所赐我的这种面子不是轻易肯给的，但是，这种光荣不论是多么的可贵，却还是不足与我内心所感到的满足相比的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he spoke these words, the judge's strict gaze lost none of its usual arrogance. He had articulated the words in his public prosecutor's voice, with the inflexible stiffness of the neck and shoulders that, as we have already mentioned, made his flatterers describe him as the living statue of the Law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他说这一番话的时候，那法官严厉的目光里，依旧保持着他往常那种骄矜的神气。他是用一个首席检察官的语气和音调来说这几句话的，脖子和肩膀硬绷绷地一动都不动，所以那些恭维他的人说他是尊法律的化身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Villefort was astonished by this unexpected sally and winced like a soldier feeling a sword-thrust beneath his armour. A scornful curl of his lip showed that he did not henceforth consider Monte Cristo a very civil gentleman. He looked around for something on which to anchor the lapsed conversation (which seemed to have broken apart as it lapsed), and saw the map that Monte Cristo had been studying when he entered. "Do you take an interest in geography, Monsieur?" he asked. "It is a rich field of study, especially for someone like yourself who, we are assured, has seen as many countries as are marked in the atlas."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福决想不到会得到这样的回答，他吃了一惊，象是一个军人感到他所穿的甲胄上被人猛击一下似的，他那轻蔑的嘴唇微微一弯，表示从这时起，在他的脑海里基督山伯爵不再是一个文明的绅士。他向周围四顾，想找一样什么东西来作为继续谈话的资料，因为刚才的那一个话题似乎已跌得粉碎了。他看到了他进来时基督山在研究的那张地图，于是说：“您似乎在研究地理吧，阁下。这是一种很有趣的学问，尤其是您，我听说，凡是这张地图上有名的地方您都已见过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, Monsieur," the count replied. "I have tried to subject the human race in general to the same analysis you daily apply to the exceptions, that is to say, a physiological one. I considered that it would eventually be easier to move from the whole to the part, than from part to whole. There is an axiom in algebra that requires us to proceed from the known to the unknown, and not the contrary… But, sit down, I beg you, Monsieur."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，阁下，”伯爵答道，“我很想把人类当作一个整体来进行一番哲学的研究，而您却每天在作个别的实验。我相信，从全体来推论部分比从部分来求解全体要容易得多。这是代数学上的一条公理，我们应该从已知数来推论未知数，而不是从未知数来求已知数，请坐，阁下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very true, Monsieur," said Monte Cristo. "Mankind is an ugly worm when you look at it through a solar microscope. But I think you said I have nothing to do. Now, Monsieur, I ask you, do you imagine you have anything to do? Or, to put it more clearly, do you believe that what you do deserves to be called something?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老实说，阁下，”基督山答道，“把人放在一只日光显微镜底下来研究，他实在只是一条丑陋的毛虫。您说我是一无所事的，真的，现在我也来问一句，您呢？您认为您是有事做的吗？说得更明白一些，您是不是以为您所做的一切够得上称为‘事’？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo directed the crown prosecutor to a chair so positioned that he had to take the trouble to bring it forward himself, while the count needed only to sit back in the one on which he had been kneeling when the prosecutor entered. In this way the count found himself half turned towards his visitor, with his back to the window and his elbow leaning on the map which, for the time being, was the object of their conversation -- a conversation which was taking, as it had done with Morcerf and Danglars, a turn that was analogous, if not to the situation, at least to the persons involved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山指一指一张椅子，于是那位检察官不得不向前移动几步就坐，而伯爵却只须向后一倒便坐到他的椅子里，维尔福先生进来的时候，他原是坐在这张椅子上的。所以伯爵是侧面向着他的客人，背向着窗，手肘撑在那张当时正在谈论的地图上，这一篇谈话也象以前与邓格拉司和马瑟夫谈话的时候一样，是随环境和对方的为人而转移的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see you are a philosopher," said Villefort, after a momentary silence in which he had been gathering strength like a wrestler meeting a powerful opponent. "Well, Monsieur, I do declare, if, like you, I had nothing to do, I should look for a less melancholy pastime."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，您自称为哲学家，”维尔福沉默了一会儿以后回答，他乘这沉默的期间喘了一口气，象是一个摔角家遇到了一个强有力的对手，“哦，阁下，真的，假如我也象您这样一无所事的话，我一定会去找一件更有趣的事来做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不——不，我懂得，阁下，那一切我都知道，因为我是专门研究各国法律的。我曾拿各国的刑事法来和自然法比较。而我必须说，阁下，我常常发觉原始民族的法律——就是报复法——最符合上帝的法律。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Villefort's amazement was only increased by this second blow smartly delivered by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the judge had heard anyone deliver such a powerful paradox; or, more precisely, this was the first time he had heard it. He struggled to find a reply. "Monsieur, you are a foreigner and, as I believe you admit yourself, part of your life has been spent in the East; so you may not know the prudence and formality that here surrounds judicial proceedings, which are so expeditiously dealt with in the East."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="基督山微笑了一下。“真的，先生，”他说，“我看您虽然有智士之誉，但您对于一切事物的见解，却仍抱着社会上那种唯物的和通俗的观点，始于人而终于人——那就是说，是人类观察事物时所可能采取的最局促，最狭窄的一种观点。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What I am saying, Monsieur, is that your eyes are fixed on the social organization of nations, which means that you only see the mechanism and not the sublime worker who operates it. I am saying that you only recognize in front of you and around you those office-holders whose accreditation has been signed by a minister or by the king and that your short-sightedness leads you to ignore those men whom God has set above office-holders, ministers and kings, by giving them a mission to pursue instead of a position to fill. This weakness is inherent in humans, with their feeble and inadequate organs. Tobias mistook the angel who had just restored his sight for an ordinary young man. The nations mistook Attila, who would annihilate them, for a conqueror like other conquerors. It was necessary for both to reveal their celestial missions for them to be recognized -- for one to say: 'I am the angel of the Lord', and the other: 'I am the hammer of God', for their divine essence to be revealed."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, well, Monsieur," the count replied, "have you reached your present eminent position without admitting that there may be exceptions, or even without encountering any? Do you never exercise your mind, which must surely require both subtlety and assurance, in trying to guess in an instant what kind of man you have before you? Should a jurist not be, not the best applier of the law or the cleverest interpreter of legal quibbles, but a steel probe for the testing of hearts and a touchstone against which to assay the gold that every soul contains in greater or lesser amounts?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的，阁下，”伯爵反驳道，“您已经达到这样显要的地位，难道您还不算是一个特别的人，或甚至没有遇到过特别的人吗？您的眼睛一定非常老练可靠，难道您从来不用您的眼睛，在一瞥之下就推断出到您前面来的是哪一种人吗？一个法官除了极端尽责地执行法律，除了极机巧地解释他业务上的诡计以外，难道还不该做一枚可以探测心脏的钢针，一块可以测验出灵魂中含多少杂质的试金石吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Please forgive me, Monsieur," Villefort continued, in bewilderment, "if when I called on you I was not aware that I was to be introduced to a man whose understanding and mind extend so far beyond the ordinary knowledge and usual cast of thought of mankind. It is not common among us, unfortunate victims as we are of the corrupting effects of civilization, for gentlemen who, like yourself, possess a vast fortune -- at least, that is what I am told; but please do not think that I am prying, only repeating -- as I say it is not customary for those who enjoy the privilege of wealth to waste their time in social speculation and philosophical dreams, which are rather designed to console those whom fate has deprived of the goods of the earth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，阁下，”维尔福回答，简直有点惊呆了，“想必您可以原谅我，因为当我来拜望您的时候，我没想到会遇到一个知识和见解远远超过常人理解范围以外的人。象您这样一位广有财产的绅士——至少，人们是这样说，请您注意，我并不是查问您，只是复述旁人所说的话而已——我说，象您这样有钱的特权阶级，竟会把时间浪费在社会空论或哲学幻想上，在我们这种文明社会里腐化了的可怜虫之间，确是不常见的事，因为社会空论或哲学幻想最适宜于去安慰那些命穷运蹇、无法享受世上荣华的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, Monsieur. I am one of those exceptional beings and I believe that, before today, no man has found himself in a position similar to my own. The kingdoms of kings are confined, either by mountains or rivers, or by a change in customs or by a difference of language; but my kingdom is as great as the world, because I am neither Italian, nor French, nor Hindu, nor American, nor a Spaniard; I am a cosmopolitan. No country can claim to be my birthplace. God alone knows in what region I shall die. I adopt every custom, I speak every tongue. You think I am French, is that not so? Because I speak French as fluently and as perfectly as you do. Well, now. Ali, my Nubian, thinks me an Arab. Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman. Haydée, my slave, believes I am Greek. In this way, you see, being of no country, asking for the protection of no government and acknowledging no man as my brother, I am not restrained or hampered by a single one of the scruples that tie the hands of the powerful or the obstacles that block the path of the weak. I have only two enemies: I shall not say two conquerors, because with persistence I can make them bow to my will: they are distance and time. The third and most awful is my condition as a mortal man. Only that can halt me on the path I have chosen before I have reached my appointed goal. Everything else is planned for. I have foreseen all those things that men call the vagaries of fate: ruin, change and chance. If some of them might injure me, none could defeat me. Unless I die, I shall always be what I am. This is why I am telling you things that you have never heard, even from the mouths of kings, because kings need you and other men fear you. Who does not say to himself, in a society as ridiculously arranged as our own: 'Perhaps one day I shall come up against the crown prosecutor'?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，阁下，我相信到现在为止，还没有哪一个人的地位可以与我相比。国王的领土都是有限制的，或限于山脉河流，或限于风俗习惯的改变，或限于语言的不同。我的王国却只以世界为界限——因为我不是意大利人也不是法国人，不是印度人也不是美国人，也不是西班牙人，我是一个宇宙人。没有哪一个国家可以说它看到我的降生，而只有上帝才知道哪一个国家会看见我死。我能适应各种风俗习惯，会各种语言，您相信我是一个法国人，因为我说法语能象您一样流利纯粹。可是，阿里，我的黑奴，相信我是阿拉伯人，伯都西奥，我的管家，把我当作罗马人，海蒂，我的奴隶，以为我是希腊人。所以您大概可以明白了吧，由于没有国籍，不要求任何政府的保护，不承认谁是我的兄弟，因此，凡是那可以阻止强者的种种顾忌或可以麻痹弱者的种种障碍，都不能麻痹阻止我。我只有两位敌手——我不愿意说是两位征服者，因为只要坚忍不屈，甚至连他们我也可以克服——他们就是时间和空间。还有第二个敌手，那是最可怕的，就是，我也是一个要死的人。只有这才能阻止我的行动，使我无法达到我预定的目标，其余的一切我都算定了。凡是人所谓命运机遇的那些东西——就是破产，变迁，环境——我都已预料到了，假如这些因素突然来袭击我，它们决不会使我一蹶不振。除非我死了，否则我是永远不会改变宗旨的，所以我敢说出这些您从来没有听到过的事情，这些事情您即使从国王的口里也听不到的——因为国王需要您，其他的人怕您。因为在我们这样一个组织不健全的社会里，人人都免不了要对自己说：‘或许有一天我会有求于检察官的吧？’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In that case, Monsieur le Comte, I admire you," Villefort said -- for the first time in this strange dialogue addressing the foreigner, whom he had until then called simply "Monsieur", by his aristocratic title. "Yes, I say, if you are really strong, if you are really a superior being, really holy or impenetrable -- you are quite right, the two amount virtually to the same thing -- then revel in your magnificence -- that is the law of domination. But do you have some kind of ambition?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末，伯爵阁下，我钦佩您，”维尔福说，在这篇奇异的谈话里，截至目前为止，他还是第一次对这位神秘人物加以贵族的称呼，以前他是只称“阁下”的，“是的，而且我要向您说，假如您真的高强，真的优越，真的神圣——或是真的无法看穿，您把无法看穿和神圣等同起来，这一点的确说得很对——那末，尽管骄矜吧，阁下，因为那是超人的特征。但您毫无疑问也是有些野心的吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no!" Villefort said quickly, doubtless afraid that he might appear to be abandoning the field. "Certainly not! With your brilliant and almost sublime conversation, you have elevated me above ordinary matters: we were no longer merely chatting, but discoursing. Well, now, you know theologians lecturing at the Sorbonne or philosophers in their disputations must sometimes tell one another painful truths. Imagine that we were debating social theology or theological philosophy, and I would say this, brutal though it is: brother, you are giving in to pride. You are above other men, but above you is God."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，决不，”维尔福说，他象怕放弃他的优势似的。“不，您这一篇光辉而且几乎可以说崇高的谈话已把我抬举到普通的水准以上。我们已不再是谈天了，我们是在讨论。但您知道，那坐在大学交椅里的神学家，和那些坐在辩论席上的哲学家，偶然也会说出残酷的真理。我们暂且算是在讨论社会神学和宗教哲学吧，下面这几句话看来虽似粗鲁，但我还要对您说：‘兄弟，你太自负了，你或许比别人高明，但在你的上面还有上帝呢。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Above everything, Monsieur!" Monte Cristo replied, in a voice of such deep emotion that Villefort shuddered involuntarily. "I have my pride for men, those serpents always ready to rise up against anyone who overtakes them, without crushing them beneath his foot. But I lay down that pride before God, who brought me out of nothingness to make me what I am."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在我们大家的上面，阁下。”基督山这样回答，其语气是这样沉重，使维尔福不由自主地打了一个寒颤。“我对人是自负的——赤练蛇每看见有人经过它的旁边总是昂起头来攻击他，即使那个人并没有踩到它。但在上帝的前面，我放弃了那种自负，因为上帝把我从一无所有提到现在这样的地位。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Like every other man, at least once in his life, I too have been carried up by Satan to the highest mountain on earth. Once there, he showed me the whole world and, as he did to Christ, said to me: 'Now, Son of Man, what do you want if you are to worship me?' So I thought for a long time, because in reality a terrible ambition had long been devouring my soul. Then I answered him: 'Listen, I have always heard speak of Providence, yet I have never seen her or anything that resembles her, which makes me think that she does not exist. I want to be Providence, because the thing that I know which is finest, greatest and most sublime in the world is to reward and to punish.' But Satan bowed his head and sighed. 'You are wrong,' he said. 'Providence does exist, but you cannot see her, because, as the daughter of God, she is invisible like her father. You have seen nothing that resembles her because she proceeds by hidden means and walks down dark paths. All that I can do for you is to make you one of the agents of this Providence.' The deal was concluded. I shall perhaps lose my soul," Monte Cristo continued. "But, what matter? If the deal had to be struck over again, I should do it."</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are other things to fear, Monsieur," Villefort said, "apart from death, old age and madness. For example, apoplexy, that lightning bolt which strikes you down without destroying you, yet after which all is finished. You are still yourself, but you are no longer yourself: from a near-angel like Ariel you have become a dull mass which, like Caliban, is close to the beasts. As I said, in human language, this is quite simply called an apoplexy or stroke. Count, I beg you to come and finish this conversation at my house one day when you feel like meeting an opponent able to understand you and eager to refute what you say, and I shall show you my father, Monsieur Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French Revolution -- which means the most splendid daring put to the service of the most rigorous organization; a man who may not, like you, have seen all the kingdoms on earth, but who helped to overthrow one of the most powerful; a man who did not, like you, claim to be one of the envoys of God, but of the Supreme Being, not of Providence but of Fate. Well, Monsieur, the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain put an end to all that, not in a day, not in an hour, but in a second. One day he was Monsieur Noirtier, former Jacobin, former senator, former carbonaro, who scorned the guillotine, the cannon and the dagger; Monsieur Noirtier, manipulator of revolutions; Monsieur Noirtier, for whom France was only a vast chessboard from which pawns, castles, knights and queens were to vanish when the king was mated. The next day, this redoubtable Monsieur Noirtier had become 'poor Monsieur Noirtier', a paralysed old man, at the mercy of the weakest being in his household, his granddaughter Valentine. In short, a silent, icy corpse who only lives without suffering to allow time for the flesh to progress easily to total decomposition."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阁下，”维尔福又说，“除了死，老，疯以外，世界还有一些可怕的事情。譬如说，中风——那是一种闪电般的袭击，它只打击您，并不毁灭您，可是经它打击以后，一切也就完了。您的外貌一点都没有改变，但您已不是以前的您了；您以前象是吃过灵芝草的羚羊，这时却变成了一块冥顽不灵的木头，象是那受了酷刑的卡立班①，这种病，是在人的舌头上，正如我所告诉您的，不折不扣的正叫做中风。伯爵阁下，假如您愿意的话，随便哪一天，只要您高兴见到一个尚能解事而且急于想驳倒您的敌手的话，那末，请到舍下来继续这一篇谈话，我要介绍您和家父见面，就是诺梯埃·维尔福先生，法国革命时期一个最激烈的雅各宾党徒——那就是说，一个最目无法纪，最果敢勇毅的人，他或许不曾象您那样看见过世界上所有的王国，但却曾帮忙颠覆了世界上一个最强有力的国家，您相信您自己是上帝和救世主的使者，他，象您一样，也相信他自己是万神之主和命运的使者。可是，阁下，脑髓里一条血管的破裂就摧毁了这一切——没用一天，没用一个钟头，而只在一秒钟之间。诺梯埃先生在前一天晚上还是老雅各宾党徒，老上议员，老烧炭党党徒，嘲笑断头台，嘲笑大炮，嘲笑匕首，诺梯埃先生，他玩弄革命，诺梯埃先生，在他，法国是一面大棋盘，他使小卒，城堡，骑士和王后一个一个地失踪，以致使国王被困——诺梯埃先生，这样可畏的一个人物，第二天早晨就变成了‘可怜的诺梯埃先生’，变成了孤苦无助的老头子，得受家里最软弱无力的一员，就是他的孙女凡兰蒂的照顾。事实上，他只剩了一具又哑又僵的躯壳，只是无声无臭地活着，只是让时间慢慢地腐蚀他的全身，他自己却不觉得它已在腐朽。”【注：①莎士比亚名剧《暴风雨》中的人物。】">查看中文翻译</div>

A hundred writers, from Socrates onwards, or Seneca, Saint Augustine or Gall, have made the same remark as you, whether in prose or in verse; yet I can understand that the sufferings of a father can accomplish great changes in the mind of his son.
