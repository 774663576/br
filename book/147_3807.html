<div class="line_en">Eugene was a great man on the campus of the little university. He plunged exultantly into the life of the place. He cried out in his throat with his joy: all over the country, life was returning, reviving, awaking. The young men were coming back to the campus. The leaves were out in a tender green blur: the quilled jonquil spouted from the rich black earth, and peach-bloom fell upon the shrill young isles of grass. Everywhere life was returning, awaking, reviving. With victorious joy, Eugene thought of the flowers above Ben's grave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金现在已经变成了这所小型大学校园的重要人物了。他欢天喜地、尽情参加各类活动。他简直开心极了：全国各地的生活又开始慢慢恢复、复兴、苏醒了。年轻的学子又重新返回到校园中。枝头新绿如烟，长着硬毛的长寿花从肥沃的黑土中冒了出来，翠绿的草坪上撒满了桃花的落英。到处都是春回大地、生机盎然的景象。尤金在这种胜利的喜悦中，想起了本恩坟头的鲜花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was wild with ecstasy because the Spring had beaten death. The grief of Ben sank to a forgotten depth in him. He was charged with the juice of life and motion. He did not walk: he bounded along. He joined everything he had not joined. He made funny speeches in chapel, at smokers, at meetings of all sorts. He edited the paper, he wrote poems and stories -- he flung outward without pause or thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">He would become at times insanely conscious of spotless youth: he was terrified before the loud good health of America, which is really a sickness, because no man will admit his sores. He shrank back at the memory of his lost heroic fantasies: he thought of Bruce-Eugene, of all his thousand romantic impersonations, and never could he endure himself with an itching tetter upon his flesh. He became morbidly conscious of all his blemishes, real and fancied: for days he would see nothing but people's teeth -- he would stare into their mouths when he talked to them, noting the fillings, the extractions, the plates and bridges. He would gaze with envy and fear at the sound ivory grinders of the young men, baring his own, which were regular but somewhat yellowed with smoking, a hundred times a day. He scrubbed at them savagely with a stiff brush until the gums bled; he brooded for hours upon a decaying molar which must one day be extracted, and, wild with despair, he would figure out on paper the age at which he might become toothless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他往往特别在意其他青年白皙、光洁的身体，他对美国人崇尚的健康有一种说不出的恐惧感，其实那是一种病态，因为没有人会承认自己有溃烂的伤疤。他想起从前所有的英雄幻想，他不由得退缩了；他想起了布鲁斯·尤金，这个曾经自命的英雄，以及成千上万个浪漫的角色。现在他自己身上有了这样一块奇庠难耐的皮癣，简直令他无法容忍。他对自己身体上的瑕疵开始病态般地神经过敏，不管是实实在在的还是幻想出来的全都如此。他常常一连几天对什么都视而不见，只关注别人的牙齿——他与别人谈话的时候，常会盯着对方的嘴巴不放，看看别人有没有补过牙、拔过牙或者镶过假牙。他常常又妒又怕地看着其他年轻人那一口跟象牙一样洁白整齐的牙齿。他一边张着嘴，露出自己虽然齐整却因为吸烟而开始发黄的牙齿。他每天要这样重复不下上百次。他用僵硬的牙刷使劲地刷着自己的牙齿，直至牙床出血。他会因为一颗迟早都要拔掉的龋齿闷闷不乐地沉思很长时间，然后绝望地在一张纸上计算自己到什么年龄牙齿就会掉光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was afraid to let people walk behind him. He sat, whenever possible, with his back to the wall; he was in agony when he descended a crowded stair, holding his shoulders high so that the collar of his coat might hide the terrible patch. He let his hair grow in a great thick mat, partly to hide his sore, and partly because exposing it to the view of the barber touched him with shame and horror.</div>

<div class="line_en">But if, he thought, I lose only one every two years after I am twenty, I shall still have over fifteen left when I am fifty, since we have thirty-two, including wisdom-teeth. And it will not look so bad, if only I can save the front ones. Then, with his hope in futures, he thought: But by that time perhaps the dentists can give me real ones. He read several dental magazines to see if there was any hope for the transplanting of sound teeth for old ones. Then, with brooding satisfaction, he studied his sensual deeply scalloped mouth with the pouting underlip, noting that even when he smiled he barely revealed his teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他心想，假使我在20岁之后每两年掉一颗牙齿，那么到50岁的时候，至少还剩15颗牙，因为每个人包括智齿在内都有32颗牙。因此如果能把门牙保护好，情况就不会太糟。就这样，他怀着对未来的美好憧憬暗自盘算着，也许到了那个时候，牙医就能为我换上真牙了。他阅读了好几本牙科方面的杂志，看看有没有通过移植健康的牙齿来代替坏牙的希望。到后来，他还会心满意足地研究他那张长着丰满下唇、肉感且噘起的嘴巴。他发现即使在他微笑的时候牙齿也只会露出一点儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He asked the medical students innumerable questions about the treatment or cure of inherited blood maladies, venereal diseases, intestinal and inguinal cancers, and the transference of animal glands to men. He went to the movies only to examine the teeth and muscles of the hero; he pored over the toothpaste and collar advertisements in the magazines; he went to the shower-rooms at the gymnasium and stared at the straight toes of the young men, thinking with desperate sick pain of his own bunched and crooked ones. He stood naked before a mirror, looking at his long gaunt body, smooth and white save for the crooked toes and the terrible spot on his neck -- lean, but moulded with delicate and powerful symmetry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, slowly, he began to take a terrible joy in his taint. The thing on his neck that could not be gouged or burnt away he identified with a tragic humor of his blood that plunged him downward at times into melancholia and madness. But there was, he saw, a great health in him as well, that could bring him back victoriously from desolation. In his reading of fiction, in the movies, in the collar advertisements, in all his thousand fantasies of Bruce-Eugene, he had never known a hero with crooked toes, a decaying tooth, and a patch of tetter on his neck. Nor had he ever known a heroine, whether among the society women of Chambers and Phillips, or among the great elegants of Meredith and Ouida, who had borne such a blemish. But, in all his fantasies now, he loved a woman with hair of carrot silk and eyes of a faintly weary violet, webbed delicately at the corners. Her teeth were small, white and irregular, and she had one molar edged with gold which was visible when she smiled. She was subtle, and a little weary: a child and a mother, as old and as deep as Asia, and as young as germinal April who returns forever like a girl, a mistress, a parent, and a nurse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，他开始慢慢地从自己的身体缺陷中找到了一种可怕的喜悦。他把脖子后面那块挖不去、擦不掉的东西看作自己天生悲剧性情的体现，有时候还会因为这一点而情绪抑郁、狂乱不已。但是他也发现自己的身体其实很健康，足以把他从忧伤的情绪中解脱出来。在他读过的小说、看过的电影和硬领广告、千百个布鲁斯·尤金式的幻想中，他从来没有见过一个脚趾弯曲、牙齿龋蛀、皮肤长癣的英雄。他也从来没有见过一个女主角的身上会有这样一些瑕疵，不管是钱伯斯和菲利普斯小说里的交际花，还是梅瑞狄斯和维达笔下的名媛淑女。现在，在他所有的幻想之中，他爱上的是一位长着胡萝卜色头发、浅紫色眼睛、眼角带有皱纹的妇人。她长着小巧的牙齿，洁白而不太整齐。她张开嘴微笑的时候，能够看出里面有一颗镀了金的臼齿。她非常精明，有一点倦怠的神情；她是女儿也是母亲，她像亚细亚人那样古老而深沉，像万物萌动的4月一样年轻，永远像少女、像主妇、像母亲、像护士一样，回到他的怀抱中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus, through the death of his brother, and the sickness that was rooted in his own flesh, Eugene came to know a deeper and darker wisdom than he had ever known before. He began to see that what was subtle and beautiful in human life was touched with a divine pearl-sickness. Health was to be found in the steady stare of the cats and dogs, or in the smooth vacant chops of the peasant. But he looked on the faces of the lords of the earth -- and he saw them wasted and devoured by the beautiful disease of thought and passion. In the pages of a thousand books he saw their portraits: Coleridge at twenty-five, with the loose sensual mouth, gaping idiotically, the vast staring eyes, holding in their opium depths the vision of seas haunted by the albatross, the great white forehead -- head mixed of Zeus and the village degenerate; the lean worn head of Caesar, a little thirsty in the flanks; and the dreaming mummy face of Kublai Khan, lit with eyes that flickered with green fires. And he saw the faces of the great Thothmes, and Aspalta and Mycerinus, and all the heads of subtle Egypt -- those smooth unwrinkled faces that held the wisdom of 1,200 gods. And the strange wild faces of the Goth, the Frank, the Vandal, that came storming up below the old tired eyes of Rome. And the weary craftiness on the face of the great Jew, Disraeli; the terrible skull-grin of Voltaire; the mad ranting savagery of Ben Jonson's; the dour wild agony of Carlyle's; and the faces of Heine, and Rousseau, and Dante, and Tiglath-Pileser, and Cervantes -- these were all faces on which life had fed. They were faces wasted by the vulture, Thought; they were faces seared and hollowed by the flame of Beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，通过他哥哥的死，以及他身上天生带来的疾患，尤金明白了某些深刻、神秘的道理，这些东西他以前从来都不知道。他开始明白了人生的奥秘，明白了生活中美好的一面往往就像白璧带着一点瑕疵。真正的健康只存在于猫和狗目不转睛的注视中，或者存在于农夫光滑、茫然的脸上。但是，他通过观察古今历史上所有帝王的面相，最终明白他们都是被美丽的思想和激情消耗、吞噬掉的。在数不清的书籍里，他见过他们的肖像：25岁时的柯勒律治，白痴般地大张着他那张松弛、肉感的嘴巴，两只眼睛瞪得圆溜溜的，正在鸦片的麻醉里幻想着信天翁在大海上振翅高飞。他宽阔、白净的前额既具有天神宙斯，也具有村夫俗子的特征；恺撒大帝瘦削、憔悴的脑袋两侧隐隐显出对权势的渴望；梦中忽必烈汗木乃伊似的瘦脸上双眼熠熠生辉，泛出绿色的光芒。他看到了伟大的托斯米斯大帝、阿斯帕尔塔和迈赛里纳斯的脸，还有所有精明埃及人的首领——他们光滑、没有皱纹的脸进一步昭显了1200位神祇的智慧。此外还有哥特人、法兰克人、汪达尔人古怪、善变的脸，他们在罗马衰老、疲倦的目光下席卷而来。还有那位满脸倦容、虚伪的伟大犹太人——迪斯累里；伏尔泰那可怕的、骷髅般的笑；本·琼森疯狂、野蛮的咆哮；卡莱尔抑郁、狂热的苦痛；海涅、卢梭、但丁、提格拉·帕尔萨以及塞万提斯——这些人都长着一张饱经生活磨砺的脸。他们的脸都被“思想”这个贪婪的家伙折磨过，被“美”的火焰烤干了，最后空空如也。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The national demand for white shiny plumbing, toothpaste, tiled lunch-rooms, hair-cuts, manicured dentistry, horn spectacles, baths, and the insane fear of disease that sent the voters whispering to the druggist after their brutal fumbling lecheries -- all of this seemed nasty. Their outer cleanliness became the token of an inner corruption: it was something that glittered and was dry, foul, and rotten at the core. He felt that, no matter what leper's taint he might carry upon his flesh, there was in him a health that was greater than they could ever know -- something fierce and cruelly wounded, but alive, that did not shrink away from the terrible sunken river of life; something desperate and merciless that looked steadily on the hidden and unspeakable passions that unify the tragic family of this earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not his quality as a romantic to escape out of life, but into it. He wanted no land of Make-believe: his fantasies found extension in reality, and he saw no reason to doubt that there really were 1,200 gods in Egypt, and that the centaur, the hippogriff, and the winged bull might all be found in their proper places. He believed that there was magic in Byzantium, and genii stoppered up in wizards' bottles. Moreover, since Ben's death, the conviction had grown on him that men do not escape from life because life is dull, but that life escapes from men because men are little. He felt that the passions of the play were greater than the actors. It seemed to him that he had never had a great moment of living in which he had measured up to its fulness. His pain at Ben's death had been greater than he, the love and loss of Laura had left him stricken and bewildered, and when he embraced young girls and women he felt a desperate frustration: he wanted to eat them like cake and to have them, too; to roll them up into a ball; to entomb them in his flesh; to possess them more fully than they may ever be possessed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于他这样一个浪漫分子，根本不想逃避生活，而是想投入生活。他并不想找世外桃源，因为他的幻想可以在现实中向前延伸，他觉得没有理由怀疑埃及是不是真的有1200位神祇，没有理由怀疑人马之神、鹰马之神、长翼神牛是否确有其事。他相信拜占庭的魔力，相信巫师瓶子里的魔仆。另外，自从本恩死后，他在心中树立了一个信念。他认为人并不是因为生活的枯燥和沉闷才要逃避生活，而是因为人太渺小了所以才会导致生活逃避人。他觉得戏剧里的激情要远比演员更加伟大。他觉得自己从来没有达到完美的境界。本恩的死给他造成的痛苦是前所未有的，他爱上并失去劳拉，留给他的只有打击和茫然。每逢他抱起年轻的姑娘或者女人的时候，就会有一种绝望的挫败感，他很想把她们一口吞下去，就像吞下一块蛋糕那样，同时也想占有她们，把她们捏成一团，埋进自己的肉体中，要用她们从来没有感受过的方式彻彻底底地占有她们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet, Eugene was no rebel. He had no greater need for rebellion than have most Americans, which is none at all. He was quite content with any system which might give him comfort, security, enough money to do as he liked, and freedom to think, eat, drink, love, read, and write what he chose. And he did not care under what form of government he lived -- Republican, Democrat, Tory, Socialist, or Bolshevist -- if it could assure him these things.

<div class="line_en">Further, it annoyed and wounded him to be considered "queer." He exulted in his popularity among the students, his heart pounded with pride under all the pins and emblems, but he resented being considered an eccentric, and he envied those of his fellows who were elected to office for their solid golden mediocrity. He wanted to obey the laws and to be respected: he believed himself to be a sincerely conventional person -- but, some one would see him after midnight, bounding along a campus path, with goat-cries beneath the moon. His suits went baggy, his shirts and drawers got dirty, his shoes wore through -- he stuffed them with cardboard strips -- his hats grew shapeless and wore through at the creases. But he did not mean to go unkempt -- the thought of going for repairs filled him with weary horror. He hated to act -- he wanted to brood upon his entrails for fourteen hours a day. At length, goaded, he would lash his great bulk, lulled in the powerful inertia of its visions, into a cursing and violent movement.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was desperately afraid of people in crowds: at class meetings, or smokers, or at any public gathering, he was nervous and constrained until he began to talk to them, and got them under him. He was always afraid that some one would make a joke about him, and that he would be laughed at. But he was not afraid of any man alone: he felt that he could handle any one if he got him away from his crowd. Remembering his savage fear and hatred of the crowd, with a man alone he could play cruelly, like a cat, snarling gently at him, prowling in on him softly, keeping cocked and silent the terrible tiger's paw of his spirit. All of their starch oozed out of them; they seemed to squeak and twitter, and look round for the door. He would get some loud pompous yokel -- the student president of the Y. M. C.

In all this jugglery, the Teutons were Weldon's masters, yet mark how thirstily the class lap it up. He will not let them read, lest some one find the rag-quilt of his takings from Zeno to Immanuel Kant. The crazy patchwork of three thousand years, the forced marriage of irreconcilables, the summation of all thought, in his old head. Socrates begat Plato. Plato begat Plotinus. Plotinus begat St. Augustine… Kant begat Hegel. Hegel begat Vergil Weldon. Here we pause. There's no more to beget. An Answer to All Things in Thirty Easy Lessons.

At night, he listened to the million-noted ululation of little night things, the great brooding symphony of dark, the ringing of remote churchbells across the country. And his vision widened out in circles over moon-drenched meadows, dreaming woods, mighty rivers going along in darkness, and ten thousand sleeping towns. He believed in the infinite rich variety of all the towns and faces: behind any of a million shabby houses he believed there was strange buried life, subtle and shattered romance, something dark and unknown. At the moment of passing any house, he thought, some one therein might be at the gate of death, lovers might lie twisted in hot embrace, murder might be doing.</div>
