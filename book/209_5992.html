<div class="line_en">The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.</div>

<div class="line_en">"MY dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.

She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说：“我现在真是太幸福了，因为你也会同我一样幸福。我一向很器重他。不说别的，光是为了他爱你，我也就要永远敬重他了；他既是彬格莱的朋友，现在又成了你的丈夫，那么除了彬格莱和你以外，我最喜欢的当然就是他啦。可是丽萃，你太狡猾了，平常连一点口风也不向我吐露。彭伯里的事和蓝白屯的事从来没有说给我听过！我所知道的一些情形，都是别人说给我听的，不是你自己说的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.

<div class="line_cn" title="伊丽莎白只得把保守秘密的原因告诉了她。原来她以前不愿意提起彬格莱，加上她又心绪不宁，所以也不讲起达西，可是现在，她大可不必再把达西为丽迪雅婚姻奔忙的那段情节，瞒住吉英了。她把一切事都和盘托出，姐妹俩一直谈到半夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="两位贵客一走进门，彬格莱便意味深长地望着她，热烈地跟她的握手，她一看见这情形，便断定他准是消息十分灵通；不多一会儿工夫，他果然大声说道：“班纳特太太，这一带还有什么别的曲径小道，可以让丽萃今天再去迷路吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying, "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.

<div class="line_en">During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="散步的时候，两人决定当天下午就去请求班纳特先生表示允许；母亲那儿由伊丽莎白自己去说。她不知道母亲是否会赞成。母亲实在太厌恶他了，因此伊丽莎白有时候竟会认为，即使以他财产地位，也挽回不了母亲的心，可是，母亲对这门婚姻无论是坚决反对也好，欣喜若狂也好，她的出言吐语反正都是不得体。叫人家觉得她毫无见识。她对达西先生不是欣喜欲狂地表示赞成，便是义愤填胸地表示反对，伊丽莎白想到这里，心里实在受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means -- that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her -- was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天下午，只见班纳特先生刚一走进书房，达西先生便立刻站起身来跟着他走，伊丽莎白看到这情形，心里焦急到了极点。她并不是怕父亲反对，而是怕父亲会给弄得不愉快。她想，她是父亲最宠爱的女儿，如果她选择了这个对象，竟会使父亲感到痛苦，使父亲为她终身大事忧虑惋惜，未免太不象话。她担心地坐在那儿，直到达西先生回到她身边，面带笑意，她这才松了口气。一会儿工夫，达西走到她跟吉蒂一块儿坐着的那张桌子跟前来，装做欣赏她手里的针线，轻声地跟她说：“快到你爸爸那儿去，他在书房里等着你。”她马上就去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it -- nothing at all. I am so pleased -- so happy. Such a charming man! -- so handsome! so tall! -- Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊丽莎白心里那块大石头这才算放了下来，在自己房间里待了半个钟头定了定心以后，便神色镇定地去和大家待在一起了。所有欢乐愉快的事情都来得太突然，这个下午就这样心旷神怡地消磨过去了；现在再也没有什么重大的事情需要担忧了，但觉心安理得，亲切愉快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上母亲进化妆室去的时候，伊丽莎白也跟着母亲一起去，把这个重要的消息告诉她。班纳特太太的反应极好。她初听到这消息，只是静静地坐着，一句话也说不出，过了好一会儿，她才听懂了女儿的话，才隐隐约约地明白了又有一个女儿要出嫁了，这对于家里有多少好处。到最后她才完全弄明白了是怎么回事，于是在椅子上坐立不安，一会儿站起来，一会儿又坐下去，一会儿诧异，一会儿又为自己祝福。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番话足以证明她完全赞成这门婚姻；伊丽莎白心喜的是，幸亏母亲这些得意忘形的话只有她一个人听见。不久她便走出房来，可是她走到自己房间里还没有三分钟，母亲又赶来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it tomorrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲大声叫道：“我的心肝，我脑子里再也想不到旁的东西了！一年有一万镑的收入，可能还要多！简直阔得象个皇亲国戚！而且还有特许结婚证──你当然要用特许结婚证结婚的。可是，我的宝贝，告诉我，达西先生爱吃什么菜，让我明天准备起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话不是好兆头，看来她母亲明天又要在那位先生面前出丑；伊丽莎白心想，现在虽然已经十拿九稳地获得了他的热爱，而且也得到了家里人的同意，恐怕还是难免节外生枝。好在事出意料，第二天的情形非常好，这完全是多亏班纳特太太对她这位未来的女婿极其敬畏，简直不敢跟他说话，只是尽量向他献些殷勤，或者是恭维一下他的高谈阔论。">查看中文翻译</div>
