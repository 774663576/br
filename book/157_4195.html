<div class="line_en">The May moon shone bright upon the private boarding-house of Mrs. Murphy. By reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays also fell. Spring was in its heydey, with hay fever soon to follow. The parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the Western and Southern trade. Flowers and summer-resort agents were blowing; the air and answers to Lawson were growing milder; handorgans, fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere.</div>

He retorted with this, and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish. A hunk of Swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck Mrs. McCaskey below one eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Mr. McCaskey was no 50-cent table d'hoter. Let cheap Bohemians consider coffee the end, if they would. Let them make that faux pas. He was foxier still. Finger-bowls were not beyond the compass of his experience. They were not to be had in the Pension Murphy; but their equivalent was at hand. Triumphantly he sent the granite- ware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary. Mrs. McCaskey dodged in time. She reached for a flatiron, with which, as a sort of cordial, she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close. But a loud, wailing scream downstairs caused both her and Mr. McCaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是麦卡斯基先生不是那种吃五毛钱客饭的人。让那些劣等的波希米亚人把咖啡当作结束吧，假如他们愿意的话。让他们去丢人现眼吧。他可精明得多。他不是没有见识过饭后洗手指的水盂。墨菲寄宿舍虽然没有这种玩意儿，可是它们的代用品就在手边。他得意扬扬地举起那个搪瓷脸盆，朝他欢喜冤家的头上一送。麦卡斯基太太躲过了这一招。她伸手去拿熨斗，打算把它当作提神酒，结束这场可口的决斗。这当儿，楼下传来一声响亮的哀号，使她和麦卡斯基不由自主地停了下来，暂时休战。">查看中文翻译</div>

He returned with the news that Mrs. Murphy's little boy, Mike, was lost. Following the messenger, out bounced Mrs. Murphy -- two hundred pounds in tears and hysterics, clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief. Bathos, truly; but Mr. Toomey sat down at the side of Miss Purdy, millinery, and their hands came together in sympathy. The two old maids, Misses Walsh, who complained every day about the noise in the halls, inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock.</div>
