<div class="line_en">Oh, it was delicious. The deep savouriness of the crabmeat, combined with the honeyed tang of the vinegar and the arresting sharpness of the ginger, made a sublime chord of flavour. I demolished the rest of the legs. I sighed. Finally, I began to lap up the custard-like meat inside the shell, nature's foie gras, and the yolk-yellow semen, dripping with golden oil. Outside the window, the sun gleamed on the still, blue waters of the lake.</div>

<div class="line_en">My steamed crab crouched on the table in front of me in a blaze of sunset-orange, its claws bearded with moss-like fur, its legs fringed with spiky yellow hair. It looked as though it might scuttle away at any moment. I prepared for the attack. Eating hairy crabs is a messy business. You cannot avoid a tussle with shell and flesh: crunch, suck, crack, lick, probe, slurp. The restaurant had provided an array of stainless-steel tools, along with dry napkins, wet napkins, plastic gloves and toothpicks. So I crushed the legs with the crushers and poked out their tender meat, excavated the frondy white flesh of the claws. Then I dipped the meat into a saucer of ginger-infused vinegar before popping it into my mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many Chinese people are obsessed with crabs, yet no one has ever managed to match the crab-induced ecstasies of the seventeenth-century play wright Li Yu. 'As regards the excellence of food and drink,' he wrote, 'there is not one single thing whose exquisiteness I am unable to describe… And yet when it comes to crabs, while my heart lusts after them and my mouth enjoys their delectable taste (and in my whole life there has not been a single day when I have forgotten them), I can't even begin to describe or make clear why I love them, why I adore their sweet taste, and why I can never forget them…'I have lusted after crabs all my life,' he went on, 'to the extent that every year as the crab season approaches, I save up my money in anticipation. My family tease me so much for treating crabs as though my life depends on them that I think I may as well call these savings my "ransom money". From the first day of the crab season until the last day they are sold, I… do not let a single evening pass without eating them. All my friends know about my craving for crabs, and they entertain and fête me with them during the season; therefore I call the ninth and tenth months "crab autumn"… Dear crab, dear crab, you and I, are we to be lifelong companions?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很多中国人痴迷于吃蟹，但要说把吃蟹时那种狂喜忘形、飘飘欲仙，写得最生动的莫过于十七世纪的戏剧家李渔。他写道：予于饮食之美，无一物不能言之，且无一物不穷其想象，竭其幽渺而言之；独于蟹螯一物，心能嗜之，口能甘之，无论终身一日皆不能忘之，至其可嗜可甘与不可忘之故，则绝口不能形容之。此一事一物也者，在我则为饮食中痴情，在彼则为天地间之怪物矣。予嗜此一生。每岁于蟹之未出时，即储钱以待，因家人笑予以蟹为命，即自呼其钱为“买命钱”。自初出之日始，至告竣之日止，未尝虚负一夕，缺陷一时。同人知予癖蟹，召者饷者皆于此日，予因呼九月、十月为“蟹秋”。虑其易尽而难继，又命家人涤瓮酿酒，以备糟之醉之之用。糟名“蟹糟”，酒名“蟹酿”，瓮名“蟹瓮”。向有一婢，勤于事蟹，即易其名为“蟹奴”，今亡之矣。蟹乎！蟹乎！汝于吾之一生，殆相终始者乎！所不能为汝生色者，未尝于有螃蟹无监州处作郡，出俸钱以供大嚼，仅以悭囊易汝。即使日购百筐，除供客外，与五十口家人分食，然则入予腹者有几何哉？蟹乎！蟹乎！吾终有愧于汝矣。（1）【注：（1）此篇出自李渔《闲情偶寄·饮馔部·肉食第三·蟹》。李渔是明末清初的文学家、戏剧家和美学家。他写的《闲情偶寄》可以说是养生学的经典著作，分了八个部分。而李渔在本书中写的吃蟹感受，让他得到了“蟹痴”的名号。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't surprising, I thought, that the pleasures of crab had been one of the themes of Chinese life and literature for centuries. Every autumn, at the start of the crab season, gourmets from Hong Kong, Tokyo and even further afield flocked to eastern China to eat them. It was a seasonal event, like the Grand National in England, or the Monaco Grand Prix. The female crabs ripen in the ninth lunar month, followed quickly by the males, and from then until the year's end it's a non-stop orgy of crabbery. Chefs in fancy restaurants incorporate hairy crab into extravagant recipes: stewed turtle with crabmeat, silken beancurd with crabmeat, 'soup' dumplings stuffed with pork and crab… Ephemeral crab shops spring up on the streets, selling live crabs burbling away in tubs, panes of glass to stop them running away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我心想，难怪几百年来中国人都爱吃蟹，也爱在文学作品中歌颂蟹的美味呢。每年秋天吃蟹季开始的时候，香港、东京，甚至更远地方的美食家，都会蜂拥到华东去尝一尝这人间至味。吃蟹一年一度，是要看季节的，就像英国的全国越野障碍赛马，或者一级方程式赛车摩纳哥大奖赛。农历九月，母蟹肥了，可以捕捞了；很快公蟹也行了。从那时候起到年底，渔民就一刻不停地捞蟹。高档餐厅的大厨利用大闸蟹制定了很多奢侈的食谱：蟹肉炖甲鱼、蟹粉豆腐、蟹粉小笼包……街巷中出现很多临时的卖蟹小摊，鱼缸里是张着钳子、吐着泡泡的活蟹，它们被透明的玻璃板困住了，跑不掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The centre of the autumn crab trade is the lakeside city of Kunshan in greater Suzhou, but these days it's a nightmare of commercial tourism. Coaches disgorge their parties of proles at tacky restaurants, where they gorge on crabs and have their photographs taken. Someone as cosmopolitan as Li Jing wouldn't dream of going to a place like that. Instead, we turned off the main road and drove through fields of cabbages to a restaurant perched on an unspoilt stretch of the lake's shore. We left the jeep and pattered over a zig-zag of bamboo walkways to a dining room propped up on stilts in the shallows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="秋蟹的交易中心，是苏州附近一座湖畔城市昆山，但到现在已经变成充满商业化的旅游区，实在是个噩梦。一辆辆大巴开过来，一群群老百姓下了车，走进那些俗气拥挤的餐厅，狼吞虎咽一番大闸蟹、拍点照片。像李静这种走南闯北见过世面的人根本不可能想去那样的地方。我们下了高速，穿过一片片卷心菜田，来到一家餐厅，就在阳澄湖边一个没有过度开发的僻静地方。我们都下了吉普车，顺着两旁翠竹掩映的弯曲小径，走进一间架在滩涂上的吊脚楼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The best crabs in China, everyone agrees, are those reared in the Yangcheng Lake near Suzhou, because of the limpid purity of its waters. That is why I ended up, on that warm October Sunday, making a day trip with friends to the shores of the lake. I was with Gwen, an old classmate from Sichuan University, and our ringleader was Li Jing, a glamorous Shanghainese divorcée in her thirties to whom Gwen had introduced me. The Shanghainese are notoriously snooty and rarely associate with the Westerners who now reside in their city. But Li Jing had lived in France, spoke fluent French and English, and worked for an international company. She was unusually open-minded, and she loved to eat. So she persuaded a rich and well-connected friend to drive us out of Shanghai in his jeep, along the new crab expressway towards Suzhou.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全中国公认最好的大闸蟹，出自苏州附近的阳澄湖，因为那里碧波荡漾、水质清淳，适合大闸蟹的生长。所以，在那个和暖的十月周日，我跟几个朋友来了个阳澄湖一日游。同行的一位朋友叫格温，是川大的老同学；还有“煽动”我们去吃蟹的李静，离了婚的上海女人，魅力四射、美艳动人，是格温介绍我认识的。上海人的傲慢自大恶名在外，据说根本不屑于跟旅居上海的西方人来往。但李静在法国小住过，英语、法语流利得很，而且在一家跨国公司供职。她的性格开朗、思想开明，真是非同一般，对吃的热爱也是一样。于是她找到个朋友，叫他开着吉普带我们出城，开上沪苏之间新建的高速公路，奔向大闸蟹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I savoured the last, tantalising morsels of meat in my crab, I glanced over at Li Jing. Dark hair falling about her shoulders, she was sucking at the coral-red ovaries of her own, female crab, her fingers shiny with its most intimate juices. Everyone in the dining room was locked in silent concentration, the only sounds the determined crunching of shells and a gentle, pervasive slurping. Once, our taciturn companion, the son of a Chinese admiral, aloof with his own self-importance, broke his silence to say, 'Remember that the crab is very cooling (han), you should drink some wine with it, otherwise you'll get a stomachache.' He nodded in the direction of the warm Shaoxing wine, infused with heating ginger. I took my wine cup in fingers stained yellow by crab semen, and raised it to my lips. The warm alcohol went straight to my head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我津津有味地品尝着自己手里那只大闸蟹稀少却诱人的嫩肉，一边瞥了眼李静。黑发披肩的她拿着一只母蟹，正吮吸着丰富的蟹黄，手指上都沾着亮晶晶的油脂。桌上的每个人都默默而专注地吃着，唯一的声音是蟹壳“咔嚓”的碎裂，和每个人轻轻的“吸溜吸溜”。开车带我们来的是个中国高级将领的儿子，他不是个看重自己身份地位的人，这一路上都谦虚而寡言，此时却打破沉默说，“注意哦，蟹是大寒的，要边吃边喝点酒，免得胃痛。”他朝桌上温好的绍兴酒点点头，那酒还泡了也属于热性食物的姜。我用沾满黄色蟹膏的手指拿起酒杯，送到唇边。温暖的酒精立刻就上了头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time we had finished our lunch, the trays on the table were piled with crab debris. We sat around for a while, drinking wine and chatting. 'This is one of the best hairy crab restaurants in the area,' said Li Jing. 'It may look plain, but the crab they serve here is a "green food product", not like the industrialised crabs you find in Kunshan. They are reared outside, just over there, on a diet of fish and snails rather than artificial feed. Even national leaders come here to eat.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after we visited the restaurant, a crab scandal blew up in the Chinese national press. Officials from the Taiwanese health ministry had examined a shipment of hairy crabs imported from the Yangcheng Lake, and found them to be contaminated with residues of an antibiotic that has been linked to cancer, AOZ. Yangcheng crab breeders insisted that they didn't use AOZ, and that the problem must lie with crabs from elsewhere that were being passed off as the real thing. According to the official Chinese media, local crab-eaters were undeterred by this cancerous little rumour, and blithely went on eating crabs for the rest of the season. But the story left a bad taste in my mouth. For the rest of my stay in Shanghai, I found myself avoiding hairy crab wherever possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们光顾那家餐厅不久，中国的媒体曝光了一场有关蟹的丑闻。台湾卫生机构检查了一批次的进口阳澄湖大闸蟹，发现全部含有呋喃唑酮代谢物AOZ，这种抗生素跟癌症有关。阳澄湖的养蟹人坚称他们没有使用AOZ，肯定是有人拿别处有问题的蟹来替代了真品。中国官方媒体报道说，来苏州吃蟹的人根本没对这含有“癌症”二字的小小谣言上心，整个吃蟹季依然无忧无虑地品尝着美味。但每每想起这件事，我嘴里总泛起一股苦涩。在上海剩下的日子里，我几乎都在有意无意地尽量避免吃大闸蟹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gwen and I left Li Jing and her friend at the table, and wandered out to look at the crab farm. Over the entrance, a large signboard showed a photograph of the former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiang Zemin, gazing into a basket of live crabs at the restaurant. Inside, the crabs lived in large cages suspended in an inlet of the lake. One of the crab-keepers showed us around, and pulled out a great hairy crab in his hand. He grinned as it waved its legs around in futile protest. What with the sun, the fresh air and the lightheadedness brought on by the wine, we were in a good mood. Until we noticed the state of the water. An oily scum swirled on the surface, with a mass of grubby flotsam that had drifted in from the lake. The legend of the pure Yangcheng waters, like so many others in China, had failed to keep pace with an industrialised reality. The thought of the crabs we had just eaten, raised amid such filth, was suddenly unappealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="李静和那位朋友还在桌上，格温和我先起了身漫步出去，看看那片养蟹场。进门的地方有个很大的广告牌，上面的照片里，一位高官正看着餐厅里的一篮活蟹。养蟹场的湖水里挂了浸水的大笼子，蟹就养在笼子里。有个养蟹人领着我们参观了一下，然后用手拉了只个头很大的大闸蟹出来。大闸蟹挥舞着八条腿儿作无用的抗争，养蟹人露出憨厚的笑容。阳光正好，空气清新，酒意微醺，我们心情相当好，直到注意到水的状况。水面上旋转着油乎乎的泡沫，还有大量从湖里飘来的肮脏废料。阳澄湖的水曾经是那么清澈纯净，现在却和中国其他的很多传说一样，没有跟上迅速工业化的现实。想着刚刚吃过这样的水里养出来的蟹，我们突然有点不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three-quarters of the half-million or so food-processing plants in China are small and privately owned. For their owners, it's often cheaper to pay the occasional fine than to invest in safe production. Once I wheedled my way into an illegal factory making preserved duck eggs on the outskirts of Chengdu. It was a small, fly-by-night workshop in a filthy yard. The workers there told me that their eggs took a mere seven-to-ten days to mature rather than the traditional three months: a sure sign, said the friend who accompanied me, that they were 'fast' preserved eggs, speeded-up by additives like ammonia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国一共有五十万左右的食品加工厂，其中四分之三是私营小企业，偶尔交点罚款，成本要比投资安全生产小多了。一次我去了成都郊区一个生产皮蛋的非法工厂，其实就是垃圾遍地的院子里一个小小的“黑心小作坊”。那里的工人们告诉我，传统的皮蛋要做三个月，而他们的只需要七到十天。陪我去的朋友说，这么短时间做出来的“快速皮蛋”，肯定是加了氨这一类的添加剂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every time I look in a Chinese newspaper these days, it is full of food scares. Ten years ago, such stories were few and far between, and those I did come across seemed almost comical -- like that of the Shanghai eel farmer who kept his eels on the human contraceptive pill to make them plumper. Now the tales are nastier, and they come thick and fast: 300 people in Shanghai poisoned by pork tainted by the drug clenbuterol; duck eggs doctored with an industrial dye; fifty babies killed by fake formula milk. It's partly, of course, because the Chinese newspapers are more frank than they used to be when in comes to discussing unpleasant issues. But it's also because of runaway economic growth, poor regulation and widespread corruption.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Chinese government was so embarrassed by the global furore that it sprang into action. Officials announced a crackdown on small, poorly regulated food-processing firms, and conducted a nationwide inspection into food safety. The results were unsettling. Inspectors found illegal industrial materials such as dyes, mineral oils, paraffin wax, formaldehyde and malachite green used in the manufacture of all kinds of ordinary foods: flour, sweets, pickles, biscuits, dried fungi, melon seeds, beancurd and seafood. The scale of corruption in the food regulation system was made clear when the former head of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration was executed for taking bribes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The contamination of Chinese food products hit the international headlines in the spring of 2007. Ironically it was concern at the health of animals, rather than people, that started it. When American cats and dogs started dying in odd circumstances, the cause was found to be a Chinese-made ingredient in their food: wheat gluten that had been doctored with the chemical melamine, a cheap protein-enhancer. The world started looking at Chinese imports with greater scrutiny. American journalists dredged up years-worth of US Food and Drug Administration reports documenting rejected imports from China: mushrooms laced with illegal pesticides; prunes stained with chemical dyes; shrimp tainted with carcinogenic antibacterials. The United States had turned back over a hundred shipments of Chinese food products in a single month that spring. And these were just the imports that had been intercepted.</div>

<div class="line_en">So it's not just middle-class paranoia that has made some of my Chinese friends hesitant about eating meat in the last few years, and my Hong Kong friends wary of ingredients imported from Mainland China. My own enjoyment of eating in China has been clouded by growing anxiety about what's actually in the food on the table. Those tempting prawns, stir-fried with black beans and chilli; that sweet-and-sour carp… Fish farms in China seem to slip a lot of banned antibiotics and fungicides into their ponds, so these may well be tainted by residues. Those tender chunks of belly pork with jujubes… growth hormones, anyone? What about the questionable chemicals used in the manufacture of deep-fried doughsticks, or the lead oxide that is a traditional additive to preserved duck eggs? Most chickens now are battery farmed, almost certainly, in conditions that I'd rather not think about in England, let alone in China. Furthermore, I've watched those peasants with cans of pesticides on their backs, drenching their beans and cabbages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，过去几年来，我的一些中国朋友不大想吃肉，香港的朋友也对从中国大陆进口的食材非常警觉。这并不单纯是中产阶级的妄想偏执。我自己对中国菜的喜爱，也因为越来越担心盘中餐里到底注入了什么，而蒙上一层阴影。那些诱人的豆豉辣椒炒大虾、那条糖醋鱼……中国的养鱼场好像经常往池塘里放一些禁止使用的抗生素与杀菌剂，所以这些食物上很可能有残留；那一块块软嫩的红枣炖猪腩……生长激素，有谁想吃的吗？还有做油条时用的那些令人疑窦丛生的化学品、通常都会添加到皮蛋里的氧化铅，有谁想吃的吗？另外，我也目睹过那些背上背着一罐罐杀虫剂的农民，把他们种的豆子和卷心菜浇透（而且很多人告诉我，自家吃的菜上面是绝对不喷农药的）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even before the pet-food scandal, a Chinese official who had once been responsible for controlling doping in sports, Yang Shumin, warned that athletes competing in the 2008 Beijing Olympics might fail their drugs tests if they dined out in restaurants, because so many anabolic steroids were routinely pumped into Chinese meat. In an attempt to avert panic in the sports world, the government hastily promised that all the food served in the Olympic Village would be purchased from selected suppliers, wrapped in tamper-proof packaging and delivered by tracked vehicles. Furthermore, the kitchens would be guarded round the clock, and all the ingredients used in cooking for the athletes would first be tested on mice! Their pledges were hardly reassuring for those of us living outside the sterile, armed-guarded, mouse-tested confines of the future Olympic Village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早在猫狗粮丑闻之前，一位曾经负责过竞技体育药物监控的中国官员就曾警告过即将参加二零零八年北京奥运会的运动员，要是他们去外面的餐厅吃饭，很有可能通不过比赛药检，因为中国的肉类中注入大量合成类固醇早就是既成事实。为了避免引起国际体育界的恐慌，政府赶忙承诺，奥运村一切食物的供应商都会精挑细选，食品会用防拆封袋装好，运送的车辆也会进行详细跟踪记录。另外，村里的厨房也会有人二十四小时守卫监管，所有用于为运动员们做饭的食材都会首先用小白鼠做实验！然而，对于我们这些“村外人”来说，这个守卫重重、有小白鼠做实验的“无菌”奥运村是进不去的天堂，政府这些信誓旦旦对我们没有任何安抚作用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aside from the deliberate adulteration of food by corrupt manufacturers, the pollution is so dire in many parts of China that it poses a direct and grave threat to human health. According to the government's own figures, 10 per cent of Chinese farmland is dangerously contaminated with excessive fertilisers, heavy metals and solid waste, and a third of the rural population lacks access to safe drinking water. Many rivers are so filthy that their waters are toxic in contact with human skin. The newspapers are filled with terrifying stories about poisoned lakes and reservoirs, their waters unfit even for irrigation. According to a World Bank report, which the Chinese government tried to suppress, 700,000 Chinese people die prematurely every year because of air and water pollution.</div>

While I'm in China, I drink Chinese tea all the time, because I adore it. Once in a while, though, when I feel that I've had enough tea, I drink a mugful of bai kai shui, plain boiled water, instead. It's usually a shocking experience. In Hunan, one memorable mugful of bai kai shui tasted of petrol and God-knows-what other chemical effluents. Even when the taste is not so extreme, the water, unmasked by tealeaves, tends to have a metallic tinge.

<div class="line_en">One day when I was living in Hunan, I went to visit a friend in Zhuzhou. Zhuzhou is on the World Bank list of the world's most polluted cities (China lays claim to sixteen of the top twenty on that list). It was a terrifying place, a blighted metropolis where the chimneys of the local metallurgy and chemical plants spewed their vile, gaseous excrement over the entire landscape. I waited for my friend in a taxi outside his work unit. The view through the car windows was apocalyptic, trails of white smoke shrouding everything, blotting out the sun. One chimney on a lower slope sent its filthy plume directly into the compound where he worked. The air was so foul that I, an outsider, scarcely dared breathe. I ate very little at lunch, because although the food was delicious, I was thinking of the tainted earth in which the vegetables must have sprouted, the corrupted water in which the fish had probably been farmed. I didn't want to let any of it into my body. How anyone could live there I did not know.</div>

<div class="line_en">My ex-pat friends in Shanghai and Beijing, particularly those with small children, don't like to think too much about the food, air or water they are forced to ingest. They try to calm their fears by making small adjustments to their lifestyles: not eating at street stalls or more dubious restaurants, for example. Even in fine establishments, there there are certain things they avoid like the plague. Once, when lunching with my Italian friend Davide in our favourite Shanghai restaurant, I was tempted to order the slippery whitefish, a local speciality. Davide raised an eyebrow. 'Have you looked at the water recently?' he said.

<div class="line_en">It's as if my gastronomic libido is slipping away. In the old days, in Sichuan, my hunger was a free and joyful thing. The food before me was fresh, free-range and wholesome, and I wanted to devour it all. But in the last ten or fifteen years China has changed beyond all recognition. I've seen the sewer-like rivers, the suppurating sores of lakes. I've read the newspaper reports; breathed the toxic air and drunk the dirty water. And I've eaten far too much meat from endangered species. In China I have to throw all my principles to the wind if I am continue in my vow of eating everything.

But he had ordered all that food himself, knowing that it was more than we could finish: his apologetic comment was made purely for my benefit, because he sensed that I, as a foreigner, might disapprove. We both knew that at this dinner hour, across the country, tables groaned like this with wasted food. In provincial capitals such as Chengdu and Changsha, there were super-restaurants that could seat five hundred, a thousand, two thousand, even four thousand guests simultaneously. And no one ever finished what was on the table. Even in remote county towns, I had witnessed scenes of such gargantuan excess that they could have been part of a medieval morality play.</div>

<div class="line_en">In some ways, such decadence is perfectly understandable. Anybody over fifty in China lived through Mao's terrible famine and the ensuing decades of rationing. Not long ago, peasants rubbed pieces of pork fat around their woks to lend a hint of meaty flavour to their vegetables, before putting the fat carefully away so it could be used again. Some people have told me they actually had dreams about pork in the 1960s. In some ways, China is still living through an extreme reaction to those years of deprivation. The profligacy is part of a vast, collective sigh of relief that it's over, that there is meat on the table, and that the puritanical Mao failed to to stifle one of the greatest pleasures of Chinese life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从某些方面来说，这样讲排场是完全可以理解的。中国五十岁以上的人都经历过“大跃进”之后的大饥荒，以及接下来长达几十年的计划经济。不久以前，农民们还要用猪油在锅里擦一圈，好让菜有点荤腥的味道；还会把没用完的猪油小心放好，下次还用。有些人还跟我说，六十年代那会儿，他们做梦都想着吃一口猪肉。在某些方面，中国人依然还活在对那些贫穷匮乏的极端反应中。这么肆意浪费挥霍，是因为以前穷怕了、饿怕了，而那样的日子终于结束了，桌上有了肉，全国人民共同长舒了一口气。那些“极左”的激进岁月中，清教徒式的生活方式令中国人生活里最大的愉悦遭到了压抑，现在是该报复性地满足一下了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is also cultural. The banquet in China is a social institution. If you are hosting a dinner for family members and friends, it's an expression of love and generosity. For clients and colleagues, it might be a demonstration of wealth and power, and a chance to win 'face' -- that peculiar Chinese concept that expresses a person's social and professional dignity. In either context, you must overwhelm your guests with food, the best you can offer. The best, of course, is almost always meat, fish and poultry rather than grains and vegetables. At a proper banquet, you may not be offered rice at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也有文化上的原因。在中国，吃酒席是一种社交制度。请亲戚朋友吃饭，能显示你对他们的爱与慷慨大方；请客户和同事吃饭，能展现你的财力和权力，是挣面子的好机会，显示你有地位，办事牢靠专业。无论请谁吃饭，你都要让客人面前摆满大菜，尽你所能来置办最体面的一桌。当然，大菜通常都是大鱼大肉，很少出现谷物和蔬菜，特别体面的大宴可能都不会上米饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

And for businessmen, the endless round of feasts they must attend in the course of their work can be a torment, particularly because they usually involve forced bai jiu toasts and unavoidable drunkenness.

I yearn also for the dishes that I lived on as a student, sitting on a stool in the Bamboo Bar and the other small restaurants around Sichuan University: the delicious fish-fragrant aubergines, the duck hearts with chilli, the stir-fried silk gourd, the twice-cooked pork with green garlic. Every so often I still find one of these mom-and-pop places, tucked away in a small street that has somehow escaped the demolition crews, serving unfashionably traditional dishes in a white-tiled shed with formica chairs and tables, and I think I'll be disappointed.

I'm ashamed to say that this kind of excess is not unusual. A vegan friend of mine once told me that all the animals I'd eaten in the course of my life would sit in judgement over me after I was dead.

<div class="line_en">The bronze ritual vessels of the Shang and Zhou dynasties are among the most ancient and potent symbols of Chinese civilisation. Wine jugs, cooking pots and steamers, they are decorated with geometric designs based on the stylised faces of monstrous animals with curled horns and staring eyes. You can see them in the oriental collections of most world-class museums. On some bronzes, the animals resemble tigers, bulls or birds; on others they are more abstract. No one knows exactly what these menacing beasts meant to the people of the Shang and Zhou, but they are known in China as tao tie. This word means, in modern Chinese parlance, 'a fierce and cruel person, or a glutton'; tao tie was also the name of an ancient villain known for his voracity, according to one antique text. The fierce animal designs of the sacrificial bronzes, one of the most recognisable symbols of Chinese civilisation, have for centuries been bound up with the idea of monstrous greed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="商周的祭祀用青铜器是中国最古老的文物，也最能代表中国文明。这些青铜器中就有酒罐、大锅和蒸锅，上面装饰着一些几何图案，还有一些虚构的怪兽的脸，有弯曲的角与目露凶光的眼睛。有些青铜器上的动物很像老虎、牛或者鸟，有些上面的则更为抽象。没人知道这些长相凶狠的动物对于商周的人们有什么意义，但中国人称它们为“饕餮”。现代汉语中，“饕餮”的意思是“凶狠残忍的人；吃货”。我还从一本古书上读到过，古时候有个以凶残暴虐闻名的恶人，也叫作“饕餮”。作为中国数千年文明最具有代表性的象征，这些祭祀用青铜器上雕刻了凶狠的动物，千百年前就记录了洪水猛兽般的暴虐贪婪。">查看中文翻译</div>

Chang, in an essay on ancient Chinese food history, once suggested that those threatening animal designs may have been emblazoned on the ritual vessels used by the Shang and Zhou ruling classes as a reminder of the dangers of gluttony.

The banquets that once seemed to be a glorious perk of my job have begun to feel like an occupational hazard, a minefield of ethical, environmental and health issues. I find myself torn between my old habit of omnivorousness, and a moral loss of appetite. A horned tao tie beast watches me as I sip my shark's fin soup, staring at me with its ancient, beady eyes.

The era of cheap food and surpluses may be over. How mad this profligacy will seem, in the not-too-distant future, when we are fighting over oil and water, perhaps even grain.

<div class="line_en">The tao tie beast, with its gluttonous associations, may be a symbol of Chinese civilisation, and the Chinese may do gluttony better than anyone, but I wonder, in the end, aren't we all just as bad? What's the difference, really, between eating shark's fin and caviar? Or cod, or bluefin tuna? They are all, now, endangered species. A third of the food bought by British households ends up being thrown in the bin. And look at us, flying around the world on holiday, eating beef reared on ranches that used to be rainforest, buying unseasonal produce flown in from the other side of the world. Think of the increasing amounts of land being given over to growing grain for ethanol production.

<div class="line_en">The Chinese do seem to eat everything, one must admit. But in a sense they are just a distorting mirror, magnifying the voracity of the entire human race. The Chinese word for 'population' is 'people mouths', and in China there are now 1.3 billion mouths, all munching away. China itself is like a big mouth eating. And it is hungry for more than just Chinese ingredients. The Chinese are slurping up the seafood of the world's oceans. And now that they have discovered dairy products, they want our milk, too, to feed their children, and their growing appetite for it is inflating milk prices on global markets. It's the same with timber, mineral and oil, which feed Chinese economic development. China has become the world's largest consumer of grain, meat, coal and steel. It may look rapacious, but the Chinese are really just catching up with the greed of the rest of the world -- on a dizzying scale.</div>

It's the way the older generation, the poor and the wise still eat: steamed rice or boiled noodles, served with plenty of seasonal vegetables, cooked simply; beancurd in many forms; very few sweetmeats; and small amounts of meat and fish that bring flavour and nourishment to the table. Unlike the typical diet of the modern West, with its profligate emphasis on dairy products and animal proteins, the traditional Chinese diet is minimal in its environmental impact, nutritionally balanced, and marvellously satisfying to the senses.
