<div class="line_en">He woke suddenly and completely. It was four o'clock, the hour at which his father had always called him to get up and help with the milking. Strange how the habits of his youth clung to him still! His father had been dead for thirty years, but, this morning it was Christmas, he did not try to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他猛地一下醒来，就再也睡不着了。现在是凌晨四点钟，正是以前父亲叫他起床帮忙挤奶的时间。奇怪的是，他年轻时养成的早醒习惯还一直保持着！他的父亲已经去世30年了，他仍旧一到4点钟就会醒。可今天是圣诞节的早晨，所以他不想再接着睡了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why did he feel so awake tonight? For it was still night, a clear and starry night. No moon, of course, but the stars were extraordinary! Now that he thought of it, the stars seemed always large and clear before the dawn of Christmas day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为何今夜他久久不能入眠？因为今晚是一个万里无云、满天星斗的夜晚。虽不见月亮，但繁星闪烁。每当他回忆起这件往事时，特别是在圣诞节的黎明之前想起它，星星就好像显得特别大，特别亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lay in his bed in his room. The door to her room was shut because she was a light sleeper. Years ago they had decided to use separate rooms. Neither of them slept as well as they once had. They had been married so long that nothing could separate them, actually.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在自己的卧室里睡下了，而妻子睡得浅，所以连接两个房间的门总是关着的。分房睡是夫妻俩多年前作出的决定。可从那之后他们就再也不像以前睡得那么香了。毕竟他们一起生活了很久，已经没有什么能把他们分开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He slipped back in time, as he did so easily nowadays. He was fifteen years old and still on his father's farm. He loved his father. He had not known it until one day a few days before Christmas, when he had overheard what his father was saying to his mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年以来，他总是不由自主地回忆起那些旧事来。那时的他才15岁，就住在父亲的农场里。他深爱着他的父亲。可他不曾察觉到父亲也是那样地爱着他，直到圣诞节前的某一天，他无意中听到父母的谈话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," his father said slowly. "But I sure do hate to wake him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“话是没错，”他的父亲缓缓地说道，“但我真的不忍心吵醒他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he heard these words, something in him spoke: his father loved him! He had never thought of that before, taking for granted the tie of their blood. Neither his father nor his mother talked about loving their children -- they had no time for such things. There was always so much to do on the farm. Now that he knew his father loved him there would be no more loitering in the mornings and having to be called again. He got up after hat, stumbling blind with sleep and pulled on his clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到父母的这些话后，他从心底明白了父亲对他的爱。这是他以前从未想到的，他以前只是想当然地以为血缘关系应该就是那样了吧！他的父母都不会把对孩子的爱挂在嘴上——他们也没有时间那样做。农场里总是有太多事要忙。现在他明白父亲是爱他的，所以早晨他再也不想赖床，再也不用父亲把他叫醒了。这时，他揉着惺忪睡眼，磕磕绊绊地从床上爬起来，把衣服穿上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wished, that Christmas when he was fifteen, he had a better present for his father instead of the usual tie from the ten-cent store. He lay on his side and looked out of his attic window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他希望在自己15岁的这个圣诞节给父亲买一份好点的礼物，而不像过去那样，只是到10美分店铺里买一条普通的领带。他侧躺着，透过阁楼的那个窗户向外望去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then on the night before Christmas, that year when he was fifteen, he lay for a few minutes thinking about the next day. They were poor, and most of the excitement was in the turkey they had raised themselves and mince pies his mother made. His sisters sewed presents and his mother and father always bought something he needed, not only a warm jacket, maybe, but something more, such as a book. And he saved and bought them each something, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还记得，那是他15岁那年的圣诞节前夕，他躺在床上想着第二天要干的事。他家里穷，圣诞节最激动人心的时刻就是吃自家养的火鸡和妈妈亲手做的馅饼。他的姐姐会亲手缝制礼物，而父母会买一些他需要的东西，可能是一件暖和的夹克，也可能是书本那些东西。当然，他也会用自己省下的零花钱给家人买些礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The thought struck him like a silver dagger. Why should he not give his father a special gift too, out there in the barn? He could get up early, earlier than four o'clock, and he could creep into the barn and get all the milking done. He'd do it alone, milk and clean up, and then when his father went in to start the milking he'd see it all done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然他的脑海里闪过一丝念头：我为什么不能在牲口棚里给爸爸送一份特别的礼物呢？我可以在凌晨四点之前起来，这样就能比父亲起得早。接着我就偷偷溜进牲口棚把挤奶、清洗牲口棚的活都干完。这样，当父亲进入牲口棚准备开始干活时，就能看到自己所做的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At a quarter to three he got up and put on his clothes. He crept downstairs, careful of the creaky boards, and let himself out. The cows looked at him, sleepy and surprised. It was early for them too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还没到3点，他就起床穿好了衣服。他蹑手捏脚地走下楼，生怕弄出声音吵醒父母。牲口棚里，一头奶牛睡眼惺忪地看着他，仿佛正为他这么早来挤奶而感到奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But they accepted him placidly and he fetched some hay for each cow and then got the milking pail and the big milk cans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是它们还是乖乖地顺从了他。他给奶牛添了一些干草，然后将挤奶用的桶和奶罐摆放整齐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The task went more easily than he had ever known it to go before. Milking for once was not a chore. It was something else, a gift to his father who loved him. He finished, the two milk cans were full, and he covered them and closed the milk-house door carefully, making sure of the latch. He put the stool in its place by the door and hung up the clean milk pail. Then he went out of the barn and barred the door behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="任务完成得比他想象的要顺利很多。挤一次奶对他来说算不上什么繁杂的事情，而是给深爱他的父亲准备的一份特别礼物。他挤的奶装满了两大奶罐。他盖上盖子，小心翼翼地把牛棚的大门关上，反复确认是否上了门闩。他把凳子放回门边，把清洗奶桶的刷子挂回门后。然后，他关上身后的门离开牛棚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never milked all alone before, but it seemed almost easy. He smiled and milked steadily, two strong streams rusing into the pail, frothing and fragrant. The cows were behaving well, as though they knew it was Christmas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他以前从来没有单独挤过奶，这件事情对他来说好像也不是很容易。他笑着，不慌不忙地干了起来。他看着不断涌出的牛奶流进奶桶里，散发着一股醉人的奶香味。奶牛很听话，好像它们知道今天是圣诞节似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
