<div class="line_en">I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. My schoolteacher thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin Costner type, who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook.</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In 1913, an income tax became permanent in the United States with the adoption of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution. At one time, Americans were anti-tax. It had been the excessive tax on tea that led to the famous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, an incident that helped ignite the Revolutionary War. It took approximately 50 years in both England and '? the United States to sell the idea of a regular income tax.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1874年，英格兰规定纳税是国民的长期义务。1913年，美国通过了宪法修正案（第16条），规定了所得税的征收合法。美国人曾经反对纳税，过重的茶税引发了波士顿港的茶党成立和独立战争的爆发。英国和美国花了几乎50年来培养公众的所得税纳税意识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes were initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad wanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes was made popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and the middle class that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses voted for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was intended to punish the rich, in reality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for it, the poor and middle class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些税最初只是针对富人，这一点富爸爸希望迈克和我明白。他解释说纳税的方法是由大众制定的并经多数人同意，它要让穷人和中产阶级看到税收是为了惩罚有钱人，因此，大众投了赞同票，并将依法纳税写人了宪法。而初衷是惩罚有钱人的税收，在现实中却惩罚了对它投赞同票的中产阶级和穷人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rich dad explained to Mike and me that in England and America originally, there were no taxes. Occasionally there were temporary taxes levied in order to pay for wars. The king or the president would put the word out and ask everyone to "chip in." Taxes were levied in Britain for the fight against Napoleon from 1799 to 1816, and in America taxes were levied to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865.</div>

He loved the idea so much that both he and my mom worked for the Peace Corps training volunteers to go to Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.

In the government, the larger his organization, the more he is respected. On the other hand, within my organization, the fewer people I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am respected by my investors. That's why I don't like government people. They have different objectives from most business people. As the government grows, more and more tax dollars will be needed to support it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet, when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective emerges. As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the masses believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics, which was to take from the rich and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government's appetite for money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the middle class, and from there it kept "trickling down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，当你研究税收历史时，一个有趣的现象产生了。如前所述，税之所以被接受是因为大众相信罗宾汉的经济理论，即劫富济贫。问题是政府的社会保障体系及各项开支越来越大，以致于中产阶级也要被征税，且税收水平不断攀升。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad that government workers were a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor dad I would hear how the rich were greedy crooks who should be made to pay more taxes. Both sides have valid points. It was difficult to go to work for one of the biggest capitalists in town and come home to a father who was a prominent government leader. It was not easy knowing who to believe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从我10岁起，我就从富爸爸那儿听说政府人员是偷懒的窃贼，而穷爸爸却说富人是贪婪的强盗，富人应该交更多的税。我相信双方都有其正确的地方，然而，为镇上最大的资本家工作和生活在作为杰出政府官员的爸爸家，这两件事绞在一起显然变得越来越难以协调了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rich, on the other hand, saw an opportunity. They do not play by the same set of rules. As I've stated, the rich already knew about corporations, which became popular in the days of sailing ships. The rich created the corporation as a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each voyage. The rich put their money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation would then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasures. If the ship was lost, the crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would be limited only to the money they invested for that particular voyage. The diagram that follows shows how the corporate structure sits outside your personal income statement and balance sheet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，富人则看到了机会，他们不按同一套规则来运作。正如我所说的，他们非常了解公司的魔力，而公司在商品经济时代正变得日益普遍。富人创办了公司来限定其资产的风险，就像用一条船去航行，富人把钱投人到公司这条“船”去航行，公司则雇一批职员（船员）把船驶向“新世界”去寻宝。一旦船沉了，船员会丧生，但富人损失的仅限于他投资的金钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation that really gives the rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. Having two fathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist, I quickly began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more financial sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized themselves, due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the "Take from the rich" crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle class. The rich outsmarted the intellectuals, solely because they understood the power of money, a subject not taught in schools.</div>

<div class="line_en">True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find a way to escape. They headed back to the protection of a corporation. A corporation protects the rich. But what many people who have never formed a corporation do not know is that a corporation is not really a thing. A corporation is merely a file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney's office registered with a state government agency. It's not a big building with the name of the corporation on it. It's not a factory or a group of people. A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul. The wealth of the rich was once again protected. Once again, the use of corporations became popular -- once the permanent income laws were passed -- because the income-tax rate of the corporation was less than the individual income-tax rates. In addition, as described earlier, certain expenses could be paid with pre-tax dollars within the corporation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真正的资本家则利用他们的财务知识逃脱了。他们借助于公司的保护逃避税收。公司的确保护富人，但是许多从未建立过公司的人却不明白这个道理，因为公司并不一定是一个真正的实体，公司可以只是一些符合法律要求的文件，在政府注册后就被放在了律师的办公室里。公司并不意味着要有刻着公司名称的大楼、厂房和雇员，它可以只是一个没有灵魂的法律实体，但富人的财富在这里得到保护。一旦所得税法被通过，成立公司就会流行起来了，因为企业所得税率低于个人收人所得税率。此外，公司的某些支出可以在税前获得抵减。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The government became a large pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal management of that money. There really is no recirculation. In other words, the government policy, if you were a government bureaucrat, was to avoid having excess money. If you failed to spend your allotted funding, you risked losing it in the next budget. You would certainly not be recognized for being efficient. Business people, on the other hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are recognized for their efficiency.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="政府成了一个巨大的钱库，但问题是还有预算管理，这不是一个自动循环重复的系统。换句话说，政府的政策是，如果你是一个政府官员，就应避免拥有过多的钱；如果你没有用完预算资金，在下次预算中你就有被削减掉这些钱的风险。你不会因为有节余而被认为有效率并得到奖励；为避免被削减预算资金，政府雇员会大量花钱和雇人，虽然这很可能是在浪费。而商人，则因为有节余而被认为有效率。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Average Americans today work five to six months for the government before they make enough to cover their taxes. In my opinion, that is a long time. The harder you work, the more you pay the government. That is why I believe that the idea of "Take from the rich" backfired on the very people who voted it in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天的美国人每年要为政府工作5—6个月，他们得挣出足够的税钱。在我看来，这真是太长了。他们工作得越努力，付给政府的就越多，这也使我更加确信“劫富”想法的人到头来是对付了他们自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This war between the haves and have-nots has been going on for hundreds of years. It is the "Take from the rich" crowd versus the rich. The battle is waged whenever and wherever laws are made. The battle will go on forever. The problem is, the people who lose are the uninformed. The ones who get up every day and diligently go to work and pay taxes. If they only understood the way the rich play the game, they could play it too. Then, they would be on their way to their own financial independence. This is why I cringe every time I hear a parent advise their children to go to school, so they can find a safe, secure job. An employee with a safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to save on taxes. Most of these vehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich who usually look for them because they are minding their own business. For example, "1031" is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate; that is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate. Real estate is one investment vehicle that allows such a great tax advantage. As long as you keep trading up in value, you I will not be taxed on the gains, until you liquidate. People who do not take advantage of these tax savings offered legally are missing a great opportunity to build their asset columns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="美国的税法允许人们采用合理的方法避税，任何人均可运用这些方法，但也只有富人才常常使用这些方法，因为他们关心自己的事业。例如，（国内收入法）第1013款，就允许销售者对“为购买更贵的房地产而卖出现有房地产时”所获得的资本利得推迟纳税。按照该规定房地产成了具有税收优惠的投资工具，只要你不断进行上述价值交换，你就无须纳税，直到你将房地产变现。不利用这些合法避税手段的人会失去很多增加他们资产项的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>

I often sat in his office waiting for him to "get to me." He was ignoring me on purpose. He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to have that power for myself one day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he always reminded me that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the world pushes you around. Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the biggest bully was not the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man.

You need to know the law and how the system works. If you're ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. If you know what you're talking about, you have a fighting chance. That is why he paid so much for smart tax accountants and attorneys. It was less expensive to pay them than pay the government. His best lesson to me, which I have used most of my life, is "Be smart and you won't be pushed around as much." He knew the law because he was a law-abiding citizen. He knew the law because it was expensive to not know the law. "If you know you're right, you're not afraid of fighting back." Even if you are taking on Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many people think the concepts of investing and understanding the market are too complex for kids. They fail to see that kids know those subjects intuitively. For those not familiar with the Elmo doll, it was a Sesame Street character that was highly touted to the kids just before Christmas. Most all kids wanted one, and put it at the top of their Christmas list. Many parents wondered if the company intentionally held the product off the market, while continuing to advertise it for Christmas. A panic set in due to high demand and lack of supply. Having no dolls to buy in the stores, scalpers saw an opportunity to make a small fortune from desperate parents. The unlucky parents who did not find a doll were forced to buy another toy for Christmas. The incredible popularity of the Tickle Me Elmo doll made no sense to me, but it serves as an excellent example of supply and demand economics. The same thing goes on in the stock, bond, real estate and baseball-card markets.</div>

For example; by owning your own corporation -- vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on -- but do it legally with pre-tax dollars.</div>
