<div class="line_en">At that time everybody in England agreed that London was a wonderful city. So I was surprised to find it rather ugly, with narrow dirty streets, and people crowded into tiny houses. I was frightened by its huge size. At Smith field, the meat market, I was shocked by the dirt and blood everywhere Then I came to Newgate Prison, where a drunk old man showed me the place where prisoners were hanged, and told me excitedly that four men would die there tomorrow. I was disgusted by this news. My first impression of London could not have been worse.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Mr Jaggers turned to me and told me that on Monday I would go to Matthew Pocket's house to start my studies, but until then I would stay with his son, Herbert, who lived near-by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，贾格斯先生转向我并告诉我星期一我将去马修·朴凯特的家，开始我的学业。不过，到那时，我将和他的儿子，住在附近的赫伯特生活在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wemmick, Mr Jaggers' clerk, showed me the way to Mr Pocket's rooms. He was a short, dry man, with a square, expressionless face, between forty and fifty years old. His mouth was so wide that it looked like a post-box, and gave the impression of smiling all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="文米克，贾格斯先生的雇员，带着我去了朴凯特先生的房间。他是一个干瘪矮小的家伙，一张面无表情的方脸，年龄四、五十岁。他的大嘴看上去像一个邮箱，总是给人留下一个冷笑的印象。">查看中文翻译</div>

About half an hour later I heard footsteps rushing upstairs, and a young man of my age appeared breathless at the door. "Mr Pip?" he said. "I'm so sorry I'm late!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上了楼梯，在朴凯特的门上贴有一张纸条，上面写着“外出即归”。他的“即归”意思和我的意思不一样。大约半小时之后，我听到冲上楼的脚步声，一个和我年龄相仿的年轻人上气不接下气地出现在门口。“匹普先生吗？”他说，“对不起，我来晚了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道为什么我在那儿？”他问，“郝薇香小姐让我去见她，看看我是否中她的意。我猜，我没有给她留下好的印象，如果她喜欢我的话，我现在可能是一个富翁了，并和艾丝黛拉订婚了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Her mother died young. Her father was very rich and very proud, with only one child, Miss Havisham, by his first wife. Then he married his cook, and had a son by her. This son, a half-brother to Miss Havisham, was a bad character, and didn't inherit as much from his father as Miss Havisham did. And so perhaps he was angry with her for influencing her father against him."</div>

My father was the only one of her relations who dared to tell her that this man should not be trusted. She was so angry that she ordered my father straight out of the house, and he has never seen her since. Her other relations were not interested in her happiness but only in inheriting her wealth, so they said nothing.
