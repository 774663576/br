Here's silken slippers, too. Shan't you look well, in these? Slip 'em on, dear girl, and come down for your breakfast. No need to be shy. John Vroom don't rise before twelve, there's only me, and Gentleman -- he's seen you in a state of dishabilly, I suppose! -- and Mr Ibbs.

<div class="line_en">I go more slowly then. I cross a busier road. The buildings are grander here -- and yet, two streets beyond them the houses are shabby. Which way must I go? I will ask again, I will ask in a moment; for now, I will only walk, put streets and streets between myself and Mrs Sucksby, Richard, Mr Ibbs. What matter if I grow lost? I am lost already…</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I cross the mouth of a rising passage of yellow brick and see at the end of it, dark and humped above the tips of broken roofs, its gold cross gleaming, the church of St Paul's. I know it, from illustrations; and I think Holywell Street is near it. I turn, pick up my skirts, make for it. The passage smells badly; but the church seems close. So close, it seems! The brick turns green, the smell grows worse. I climb, then suddenly sink, emerge in open air and almost stumble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我走进一条上坡的黄砖走廊，在走廊尽头望见，层层破烂屋顶之外，有座深色拱顶，其上一个金十字架隐隐泛光，那是圣保罗教堂。我在插画里见过；我想霍尼威尔街便在那附近。我转身提起裙子，便要过去。走廊里气味难闻；但那教堂仿佛近在咫尺。近得仿佛伸手可触！墙砖变成了绿色，气味更加难闻。我跳将过去，随即落下，落在敞开的空气中，险些绊倒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember walking beside the Thames, at Briar. I remember seeing it seem to fret and worry at its banks: I thought it longed -- as I did -- to quicken, to spread. I did not know it would spread to this. It flows, like poison. Its surface is littered with broken matter -- with hay, with wood, with weed with paper, with tearings of cloth, with cork and tilting bottles. It moves, not as a river moves, but as a sea: it heaves. And where it breaks, against the hulls of boats, and where it is thrown, upon the shore, and about the stairs and the walls and wooden piers that rise from it, it froths like sour milk.</div>

They don't look up, and do not see me, though I stand for a minute and watch them wade.</div>

Then the man draws back, puts up his window with a bang; the cab pulls away. I let out my breath. I have begun to shake. I should like to stop, to rest; I dare not, now. I leave the bridge: here the road meets another, more busy than those on the southern shore; but more anonymous too, I think. I am grateful for that, though the crowds -- the crowds are terrible. Never mind, never mind, push through them. Go on. Westwards, as the driver directed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What, but go over," says the woman, nodding again to the house. The girl with the taper is gone, and the lamp burns feebly. The windows are shuttered, the glass above them black, as if the rooms are filled with darkness. The door is high -- divided in two, like the great front door at Briar. I see it, and am gripped by panic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么办，先看看呀。”那妇人朝那所房子点点头说道。执蜡烛的姑娘已经不在了，灯火微弱无力。那宅子的窗户紧闭，窗玻璃涂成了黑色，仿佛房间里盛满了黑暗。房子大门很高——两扇对开，就像布莱尔的大门。我望着大门，一阵恐惧袭上心头。">查看中文翻译</div>

Mr Ibbs paces in his shirt-sleeves, making the floorboards jump and creak. Mrs Sucksby stands, her eyes on nothing, her face white as powder, like John's. She stands still. But when she sees me come she folds and winces -- puts her hand to her heart as if struck.</div>

I know the house to stop at, from the house which faces it -- the one with the ointment-coloured shutters, that I have gazed at so hard from Mrs Sucksby's window. John answers my knock.
