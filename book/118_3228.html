<div class="line_en">That same afternoon Charles Stow and Baptista Trewthen travelled by train to the town of Trufal. Charles was, surprisingly, very careful of appearances, and found a room for Baptista in a different house from where he was staying. On Sunday they went to church and then walked around the town, on Monday Charles made the arrangements, and by nine o'clock on Tuesday morning they were husband and wife.</div>

<div class="line_en">They arrived two hours before the boat left, so to pass the time they decided to walk along the cliffs a little way. It was a hot summer day, and Charles wanted to have a swim in the sea. Baptista did not like the idea of sitting alone while he swam. "But I'll only be a quarter of an hour," Charles said, and Baptista passively accepted this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在开船前两小时到了那里，于是决定沿着海崖散一小会儿步，借此打发时间。时值夏季，气候炎热，查尔斯很想到海里游个泳，巴普蒂丝塔却不太愿意在他游泳的时候独自坐着。“可我只游一刻钟。”查尔斯说道，巴普蒂丝塔顺从地答应了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the first time in her life Baptista had gone against her parents' wishes. She went cold with fear when she thought of their first meeting with her new husband. But she felt she had to tell them as soon as possible, and now the most important thing was to get home to St Maria's. So, in a great hurry, they packed their bags and caught the train to Pen-zephyr.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是巴普蒂丝塔生平第一次违背父母的意愿。一想到父母与新婚丈夫第一次见面的情形，她就害怕得浑身发冷。但她还是觉得必须尽快把这事告诉他们，于是回圣玛丽亚岛上的家里去就成了最重要的事。因此，他们匆匆忙忙地收拾好行李，搭上了去往彭泽弗的火车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She sat high up on the cliffs, and watched him go down a footpath, disappear, appear again, and run across the beach to the sea. She watched him for a moment, then stared out to sea, thinking about her family. They were probably not worried about her, because she had sometimes missed the boat before, but they were expecting her to arrive today and to marry David Heddegan tomorrow. "How angry father will be!" she thought miserably. "And mother will say I've made a terrible mistake! I almost wish I hadn't married Charles, in that moment of madness! Oh dear, what have I done!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐在高高的海崖上，看着他从一条小路走下去，身影消失了一会儿，继而又出现在视野里，穿过海滩跑向大海。她看了他一会儿，将目光转向大海，想着她的家人。他们也许并不太担心她，因为之前她也误过几次船。不过他们一定在盼着她今天到家，明天好嫁给戴维·赫德根。“爸爸会多么生气啊，”她痛苦地想着，“而妈妈一定会说我犯了个可怕的错误！我甚至希望自己没有因为一时冲动而嫁给查尔斯！哦，天啊，我都干了些什么啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This made her think of her new husband, and she turned to look for him. He did not appear to be in the sea any more, and she could not see him on the beach. By this time she was frightened, and she climbed down the path as quickly as her shaking legs could manage. On the beach she called two men to help her, but they said they could see nothing at all in the water. Soon she found the place where Charles had left his clothes, but by now the sea had carried them away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这使她想起了新婚的丈夫，于是转而开始搜寻他的身影。看起来，他已经不在海里了，可她也没在海岸上看见他。她这下子可吓坏了，赶紧拖着颤抖的双腿用最快的速度冲下小路。到了海滩上，她找了两个人来帮忙，可他们说海里什么都看不到。很快，她找到了查尔斯放衣服的地方，此时海水早已把衣服冲走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a few minutes she stood there without moving. There was only one way to explain this sudden disappearance -- her husband had drowned. And as she stood there, it began to seem like a terrible dream, and the last three days of her life with Charles seemed to disappear. She even had difficulty in remembering his face. "How unexpected it was, meeting him that day!" she thought. "And the wedding did I really agree to it? Are we really married? It all happened so fast!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在原地呆立了好几分钟。只有一个理由能解释她丈夫的突然失踪——他溺水身亡了。她呆立在那儿，一切就像一场噩梦，而她和查尔斯共度的这三天就像凭空消失了一样。她甚至很难想起他的模样来。“那天和他的相遇是多么出其不意啊！”她想，“我真的同意举行婚礼了吗？我们真的结婚了吗？这一切发生得太快了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She began to cry, still standing there on the beach. She did not know what to do, or even what to think. Finally, she remembered the boat, and catching the boat home seemed the easiest thing to do. So she walked to the station, arranged for someone to carry her luggage, and went down to the boat. She did all this automatically, in a kind of dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站在海滩上哭了起来，不知道该做什么，甚至不知道该想什么。最后，她想起了船，看样子最简单的事就是坐船回家了。于是她走到码头，叫人帮忙提着行李上了船。她机械地做着这些事情，如同梦游一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just before the boat left, she heard part of a conversation which made her sure that Charles was dead. One passenger said to another, "A man drowned here earlier today, you know. He swam out too far, they say. A stranger, I think. Some people in a boat saw him, but they couldn't get to him in time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在开船前，她听到了一小段对话，让她确信查尔斯真的死了。一名旅客对另一名旅客说：“今天早些时候有个男人在这里溺死了，知道吗。他们说他游得太远了。我猜他是个异乡人。有人在船上看见了他，但却没来得及赶过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Baptista had to agree, and smile, and make conversation. Mr Heddegan had spoken to her before she was ready to say anything. Now the moment had passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴普蒂丝塔只得点头赞同，微笑着跟他交谈。赫德根先生还没等她开口就已经跟她聊了起来。而现在，坦言一切的时机已经过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="船靠岸时，她的父母已经在那儿迎接她了。父亲与赫德根先生并肩往家走，母亲则走在巴普蒂丝塔身旁，喋喋不休地边走边说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope you're well, my dear?" he said. He was a healthy, red-faced man of fifty-five. "I wanted to come across to meet you. What bad luck that you missed the boat on Saturday!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希望你一切都好，亲爱的。”他说。他55岁，身体健康，红光满面。“我想要过来接你。你星期六误了船，真是不走运啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boat was a long way out to sea before Baptista realized that Mr Heddegan was on the boat with her. She saw him walking towards her and quickly took the wedding ring off her left hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船在海上驶出了很远，巴普蒂丝塔才意识到赫德根先生跟她在同一条船上。她看到他朝自己走过来，于是飞快地将左手上的结婚戒指撸了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm so happy, my child," said Mrs Trewthen in her loud, cheerful voice, "that you've kept your promise to marry Mr Heddegan. How busy we've been! But now things are all ready for the wedding, and a few friends and neighbours are coming in for supper this evening." Again, the moment for confessing had passed, and Baptista stayed silent.</div>

<div class="line_en">The young woman passively obeyed her mother's orders. The evening was a great success for all except Baptista. She had no chance to tell her parents the news, and it was already much more difficult than it had been at first. By the end of the evening, when all the neighbours had left, she found herself alone in her bedroom again. She had come home with much to say, and had said none of it. She now realized that she was not brave enough to tell her story. And as the clock struck midnight, she decided it should stay untold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻的姑娘听从了母亲的吩咐。整个晚上，除了巴普蒂丝塔之外，人人都很开心。她没有机会跟父母坦白，而现在要说出来更是难上加难了。晚餐结束时，邻居们纷纷走了，她发现自己再一次独自待在了卧室里。她回家本来有满腹的话要说，但却什么都没说出来。她这才意识到自己没勇气说出自己的故事。钟敲12点的时候，她终于决定对此只字不提。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baptista got out of bed, looked out of the window, and took the easy way. She put her best clothes on, confessed nothing, and kept her promise to marry David Heddegan.</div>
