<div class="line_en">Thoughts of the summer they'd shared came back to her, and as she stared at him, she noticed how little he'd changed since she'd last seen him. He looked good, she thought. With his shirt tucked loosely into old faded jeans, she could see the same broad shoulders she remembered, tapering down to narrow hips and a flat stomach. He was tan, too, as if he'd worked outside all summer, and though his hair was a little thinner and lighter than she remembered, he looked the same as he had when she'd known him last.</div>

<div class="line_en">Neither one of them moved as they faced each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hadn't said anything, his muscles seemed frozen, and for a second she thought he didn't recognize her. Suddenly she felt guilty about showing up this way, without warning, and this made it harder. She had thought it would be easier somehow, that she would know what to say. But she didn't. Everything that came into her head seemed inappropriate, somehow lacking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hello, Noah. It's good to see you again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she was finally ready, she took a deep breath and smiled.</div>

<div class="line_en">She heard the shock in his voice as he spoke, and surprising her, it all came together -- being here, seeing him. She felt something twitch inside, something deep and old, something that made her dizzy for just a second.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You too…," he stammered. He brought his hand to his chin, and she noticed he hadn't shaved. "It's really you, isn't it? I can't believe it…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her comment startled him, and he looked at her with amazement in his eyes. Then, after shaking his head slightly, he slowly began to smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She caught herself fighting for control. She hadn't expected this to happen, didn't want it to happen. She was engaged now. She hadn't come here for this… yet…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet the feeling went on despite herself, and for a brief moment she felt fifteen again. Felt as she hadn't in years, as if all her dreams could still come true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Felt as though she'd finally come home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without another word they came together, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, and he put his arms around her, drawing her close. They held each other tightly, making it real, both of them letting the fourteen years of separation dissolve in the deepening twilight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet…</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cry…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stayed like that for a long time before she finally pulled back to look at him. Up close, she could see the changes she hadn't noticed at first. He was a man now, and his face had lost the softness of youth. The faint lines around his eyes had deepened, and there was a scar on his chin that hadn't been there before. There was a new edge to him; he seemed less innocent, more cautious, and yet the way he was holding her made her realize how much she'd missed him since she'd seen him last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I saw the story on the house in the Raleigh paper a couple of weeks ago, and I had to come see you again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her eyes brimmed with tears as they finally released each other. She laughed nervously under her breath while wiping the tears from the corners of her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you okay?" he asked, a thousand other questions on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stepped back, trying to compose herself, wiping away the last of her tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's okay," he said, smiling, "I still can't believe it's you. How did you find me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She felt the blood in her face. Just like fourteen years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you. You look great, too." And he did, no doubt about it. The years had treated him well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah smiled broadly. "I'm glad you did." He stepped back just a bit. "God, you look fantastic. You're even prettier now than you were then."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So what have you been up to? Why are you here?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His questions brought her back to the present, making her realize what could happen if she wasn't careful. Don't let this get out of hand, she told herself; the longer it goes on, the harder it's going to be. And she didn't want it to get any harder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned away and took a deep breath, wondering how to say it, and when she finally started, her voice was quiet. "Noah, before you get the wrong idea, I did want to see you again, but there's more to it than just that." She paused for a second. "I came here for a reason. There's something I have to tell you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked away and didn't answer for a moment, surprised that she couldn't tell him just yet. In the silence, Noah felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. Whatever it was, was bad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What happened to her leg?" she asked, stalling for time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was suddenly rattled by the sharp cry of a raccoon, and Clem came out from under the porch, barking gruffly. Both of them turned at the commotion, and Allie was glad for the distraction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is he yours?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hit by a car a few months back. Doc Harrison, the vet, called me to see if I wanted her because her owner didn't anymore. After I saw what had happened, I guess I just couldn't let her be put down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah nodded, feeling the tightness in his stomach. "Actually it's a she. Clementine's her name. But yeah, she's all mine." They both watched as Clem shook her head, stretched, then wandered toward the sounds. Allie's eyes widened just a bit when she saw her limp away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You were always nice like that," she said, trying to relax. She paused, then looked past him toward the house. "You did a wonderful job restoring it. It looks perfect, just like I knew it would someday."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thanks, that's nice of you. It was quite a project, though. I don't know if I would do it again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And with that thought, she realized how much had changed since then. They were strangers now; she could tell by looking at him. Could tell that fourteen years apart was a long time. Too long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course you would," she said. She knew exactly how he felt about this place. But then, she knew how he felt about everything -- or at least she had a long time ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned his head in the same direction as hers while he wondered about the small talk and what she was holding back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is it, Allie?" He turned to her, compelling her to look, but she continued to stare at the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This whole thing. Showing up out of the blue, not knowing what I want to say. You must think I'm crazy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Even though I don't know why, I can see this is hard for you. Why don't we go for a walk?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not crazy," he said gently. He reached for her hand, and she let him hold it as they stood next to one another. He went on:</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not? I think we both could use one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hesitated and looked to his front door. "Do you need to tell anyone?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Like we used to?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, there's no one to tell. It's just me and Clem." Even though she'd asked, she had suspected there wouldn't be anyone else, and inside she didn't know how to feel about that. But it did make what she wanted to say a little harder. It would have been easier if there was someone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They started toward the river and turned on a path near the bank. She let go of his hand, surprising him, and walked on with just enough distance between them so that they couldn't accidentally touch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked at her. She was pretty still, with thick hair and soft eyes, and she moved so gracefully that it almost seemed as though she were gliding. He'd seen beautiful women before, though, women who caught his eye, but to his mind they usually lacked the traits he found most desirable. Traits like intelligence, confidence, strength of spirit, passion, traits that inspired others to greatness, traits he aspired to himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a long moment before she answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Since last December. I worked up north for a while, then spent the last three years in Europe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded and she went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How long have you been back here?" she asked as the path gave way to a small grass hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. My roots are here. This is where I'm supposed to be." He paused. "But what about you?" He asked the question softly, suspecting the worst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Congratulations," he finally said, wondering how convincing he sounded. "When's the big day?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you glad to be back home?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked to him with questions in her eyes. "The war?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked down when she said it, suddenly feeling just a bit weaker. So that was it. That's what she needed to tell him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought you might be there. I'm glad you made it out okay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie had those traits, he knew, and as they walked now, he sensed them once again lingering beneath the surface. "A living poem" had always been the words that came to mind when he tried to describe her to others.</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah took a couple of steps before answering. "He passed on earlier this year, right after I got back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded, not surprised. The Hammonds were one of the most powerful and influential families in the state. Cotton money. Unlike that of his own father, the death of Lon Hammond Sr. had made the front page of the newspaper. "I've heard of them. His father built quite a business. Did Lon take over for him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her voice was distant when she answered, or at least he thought it was. Noah wondered if it was just his mind playing tricks on him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How's your daddy doing?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"With his name, he must be busy."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. He's a good man, Noah. You would like him."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't answer right away, as if she were considering the question for the first time. Then:</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They reached the top of the hill and stopped. The oak tree was in the distance, with the sun glowing orange behind it. Allie could feel his eyes on her as she stared in that direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," he answered, volunteering no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded, and the two walked in silence for a moment.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is your fiancé here on business?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shook her head. "No, he's still in Raleigh." Noah raised his eyebrows. "Does he know you're here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She hesitated. "I don't know…," she said, trailing off, and the way she said it made him believe her. The gravel crunched beneath their feet as they walked in silence for a few steps. Then he asked:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shook her head again and answered slowly. "No. I told him I was looking for antiques. He wouldn't understand my coming here."</div>

<div class="line_en">She answered automatically. "Yes, I love him." The words hurt. But again, he thought he heard something in her tone, as if she were saying it to convince herself.

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you're happy, Allie, and you love him, I won't try to stop you from going back to him. But if there's a part of you that isn't sure, then don't do it. This isn't the kind of thing you go into halfway."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Allie watched him walk away and noticed the tension she'd felt when telling him about her engagement was beginning to fade. Closing her eyes, she ran her hands through her hair and let the light breeze fan her cheek. She took a deep breath and held it for a moment, feeling the muscles in her shoulders further relax as she exhaled. Finally, opening her eyes, she stared at the beauty that surrounded her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You were the best friend I ever had, Allie. I'd still like to be friends, even if you are engaged, and even if it is just for a couple of days. How about we just kind of get to know each other again?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She started walking toward him then, listening to the crickets chirp, and remembered a lesson from childhood. She counted the number of chirps in a minute and added twenty-nine. Sixty-seven degrees, she thought as she smiled to herself. She didn't know if it was accurate, but it felt about right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She always loved evenings like this, evenings where the faint aroma of autumn leaves rode on the backs of soft southern winds. She loved the trees and the sounds they made. Listening to them helped her relax even more. After a moment, she turned toward Noah and looked at him almost as a stranger might.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">God, he looked good. Even after all this time. She watched him as he reached for a rope that hung in the water. He began to pull it, and despite the darkening sky, she saw the muscles in his arm flex as he lifted the cage from the water. He let it hang over the river for a moment and shook it, letting most of the water escape. After setting the trap on the dock, he opened it and began to remove the crabs one by one, placing them into a bucket.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stepped on the dock and it creaked under her foot. The sound reminded her of a rusty squeeze-box, and Noah glanced up and winked, then went back to checking the crabs, making sure they were the right size. She walked to the rocker that sat on the dock and touched it, running her hand along the back. She could picture him sitting in it, fishing, thinking, reading. It was old and weather-beaten, rough feeling. She wondered how much time he spent here alone, and she wondered about his thoughts at times like those.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she walked, she looked around and realized she had forgotten how fresh and beautiful everything seemed here. Over her shoulder, she saw the house in the distance. He had left a couple of lights on, and it seemed to be the only house around. At least the only one with electricity. Out here, outside the town limits, nothing was certain. Thousands of country homes still lacked the luxury of indoor lighting.</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked to the other side of the dock, feeling a sense of closure. A compulsion had driven her here, and for the first time in three weeks the feeling was gone. She'd somehow needed Noah to know about her engagement, to understand, to accept it -- she was sure of that now -- and while thinking of him, she was reminded of something they'd shared from the summer they were together. With head down, she paced around slowly, looking for it until she found it -- the carving. Noah loves Allie, in a heart. Carved into the dock a few days before she'd left.</div>

<div class="line_en">A breeze broke the stillness and chilled her, making her cross her arms. She stood that way, alternately looking down at the carving and then toward the river, until she heard him reach her side. She could feel his closeness, his warmth, as she spoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good enough," he said as he reached the back porch and started up the steps. He set the bucket by the door, then led the way inside, heading toward the kitchen. It was on the immediate right, large and smelling of new wood. The cabinets had been done in oak, as was the floor, and the windows were large and faced east, allowing the light from morning sun. It was a tasteful restoration, not overdone as was common when homes like this were rebuilt.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky had turned black, and Noah started toward the house, Allie right beside him. In the silence her mind wandered, and she felt a little light-headed as she walked along the path. She wondered what he was thinking about her being here and wasn't exactly sure if she knew herself. When they reached the house a couple of minutes later, Clem greeted them with a wet nose in the wrong place. Noah motioned her away, and she left with her tail between her legs.</div>

She shook her head, amazed at how much he had done.</div>

<div class="line_en">She toured the house for the next few minutes, walking through the rooms, noticing how wonderful it looked. By the time she'd finished, it was hard to remember how run-down it had been. She came down the stairs, turned toward the kitchen, and saw his profile. For a second he looked like a young man of seventeen again, and it made her pause a split second before going on. Damn, she thought, get a hold of yourself. Remember that you're engaged now.</div>

<div class="line_en">He laughed under his breath. "No. I always thought I would when I was young, and I started that way. But it was just too much.

<div class="line_en">"It was wrong of her to do that, Noah, and I'm sorry she did. But try to understand. Once I left, she probably thought it would be easier for me to just let it go. She never understood how much you meant to me, and to be honest, I don't even know if she ever loved my father the way I loved you. In her mind, she was just trying to protect my feelings, and she probably thought the best way to do that was to hide the letters you sent."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hesitated, not expecting the question. Bringing up Lon's name brought slight feelings of guilt to the surface, and for a moment she didn't know how to answer.

<div class="line_en">She surprised herself with her answer but knew it was true nonetheless. And she also knew by looking at him that Noah had suspected the answer in advance.</div>

<div class="line_en">She shook her head, and Noah went to the kitchen and put the crabs in the steamer and the bread in the oven. He found some flour and cornmeal for the vegetables, coated them, and put some grease into the frying pan. After turning the heat on low, he set a timer and pulled another beer from the icebox before heading back to the porch. And while he was doing those things, he thought about Allie and the love that was missing from both their lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet was it normal for her insides to twitch whenever he came near? Was it normal to confess things she could never tell anyone else? Was it normal to come here three weeks from her wedding day?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah came out at that moment and she smiled at him, glad he'd come back so she didn't have to think about it anymore. "It's going to take a few minutes," he said as he sat back down.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie, too, was thinking. About Noah, about herself, about a lot of things. For a moment she wished she weren't engaged but then quickly cursed herself. It wasn't Noah she loved; she loved what they once had been. Besides, it was normal to feel this way. Her first real love, the only man she'd ever been with -- how could she expect to forget him?</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've been drawing and painting since I was a child. I guess that once I got a little older, I began to think I was good at it. I enjoyed it, too.

Anyway, I ended up majoring in art in college because it was something I had to do; I remember spending hours in the studio all by myself and enjoying every minute. I loved the freedom I felt when I created, the way it made me feel inside to make something beautiful. Just before I graduated, my professor, who happened to also be the critic for the paper, told me I had a lot of talent. He told me I should try my luck as an artist.

<div class="line_en">"You can still do it, Allie. I know you can. You have a talent that comes from inside you, from your heart, not from your fingers. What you have can't ever go away. It's what other people only dream about. You're an artist, Allie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why it happened, she never knew, but this was when the chasm began to close for Allie, the chasm she had erected in her life to separate the pain from the pleasure. And she suspected then, maybe not consciously, that there was more to this than even she cared to admit.</div>

<div class="line_en">But at that moment she still wasn't completely aware of it, and she turned to face him.

<div class="line_en">The timer went off in the kitchen, a small ding, and Noah turned away, breaking the moment, strangely affected by what had just happened between them. Her eyes had spoken to him and whispered something he longed to hear, yet he couldn't stop the voice inside his head, her voice, that had told him of her love for another man. He silently cursed the timer as he walked to the kitchen and removed the bread from the oven. He almost burned his fingers, dropped the loaf on the counter, and saw that the frying pan was ready. He added the vegetables and heard them begin to crackle. Then, muttering to himself, he got some butter out of the icebox, spread some on the bread, and melted a bit more for the crabs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky grew darker and the moon rose higher as the evening wore on. And without either of them being conscious of it, they began to regain the intimacy, the bond of familiarity, they had once shared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Afterward Allie tried to remember the last time she and Lon had talked this way. Although he listened well and they seldom argued, he was not the type of man to talk like this. Like her father, he wasn't comfortable sharing his thoughts and feelings. She'd tried to explain that she needed to be closer to him, but it had never seemed to make a difference.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah got up and refilled the teapot. They both brought the dishes to the sink and cleaned up the table, and he poured two more cups of hot water, adding teabags to both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They finished dinner, both pleased with the meal, neither talking much now. Noah looked at his watch and saw that it was getting late. The stars were out in full, the crickets a little quieter. He had enjoyed talking to Allie and wondered if he'd talked too much, wondered what she'd thought about his life, hoping it would somehow make a difference, if it could.</div>

<div class="line_en">For something had happened during dinner. Quite simply, he had fallen in love again. He knew that now as they sat next to one another. Fallen in love with a new Allie, not just her memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then, he had never really stopped, and this, he realized, was his destiny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's been quite a night," he said, his voice softer now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, it has," she said, "a wonderful night." Noah turned to the stars, their twinkling lights reminding him that she would be leaving soon, and he felt almost empty inside. This was a night he wanted never to end. How should he tell her? What could he say that would make her stay?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't know. And thus the decision was made to say nothing. And he realized then that he had failed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How about the porch again?" he asked, handing her the cup, and she agreed, leading the way. He grabbed a quilt for her in case she got cold, and soon they had taken their places again, the quilt over her legs, rockers moving. Noah watched her from the corner of his eye. God, she's beautiful, he thought. And inside, he ached.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What should I say?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rockers moved in quiet rhythm. Bats again, over the river. Moths kissing the porch light. Somewhere, he knew, there were people making love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Talk like you did to me under the oak tree." And he did, reciting distant passages, toasting the night. Whitman and Thomas, because he loved the images. Tennyson and Browning, because their themes felt so familiar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She rested her head against the back of the rocker, closing her eyes, growing just a bit warmer by the time he'd finished. It wasn't just the poems or his voice that did it. It was all of it, the whole greater than the sum of the parts. She didn't try to break it down, didn't want to, because it wasn't meant to be listened to that way. Poetry, she thought, wasn't written to be analyzed; it was meant to inspire without reason, to touch without understanding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Talk to me," she finally said, her voice sensual. Or was his mind playing tricks?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because of him, she'd gone to a few poetry readings offered by the English department while in college. She'd sat and listened to different people, different poems, but had stopped soon after, discouraged that no one inspired her or seemed as inspired as true lovers of poetry should be.</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was something else that made her want to wait, and it had to do with Lon himself. He was driven in his work, and it always commanded most of his attention. Work came first, and for him there was no time for poems and wasted evenings and rocking on porches. She knew this was why he was successful, and part of her respected him for that. But she also sensed it wasn't enough. She wanted something else, something different, something more. Passion and romance, perhaps, or maybe quiet conversations in candlelit rooms, or perhaps something as simple as not being second.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They rocked for a while, drinking tea, sitting quietly, drifting in their thoughts. The compulsion that had driven her here was gone now -- she was glad for this -- but she worried about the feelings that had taken its place, the stirrings that had begun to sift and swirl in her pores like gold dust in river pans. She'd tried to deny them, hide from them, but now she realized that she didn't want them to stop. It had been years since she'd felt this way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lon could not evoke these feelings in her. He never had and probably never would. Maybe that was why she had never been to bed with him. He had tried before, many times, using everything from flowers to guilt, and she had always used the excuse that she wanted to wait until marriage. He took it well, usually, and she sometimes wondered how hurt he would be if he ever found out about Noah.</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah, too, was sifting through his thoughts. To him, the evening would be remembered as one of the most special times he had ever had. As he rocked, he remembered it all in detail, then remembered it again. Everything she had done seemed somehow electric to him, charged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, sitting beside her, he wondered if she'd ever dreamed the same things he had in the years they'd been apart. Had she ever dreamed of them holding each other again and kissing in soft moonlight? Or did she go further and dream of their naked bodies, which had been kept separate for far too long…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked to the stars and remembered the thousands of empty nights he had spent since they'd last seen each other. Seeing her again brought all those feelings to the surface, and he found it impossible to press them back down. He knew then he wanted to make love to her again and to have her love in return. It was what he needed most in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Allie knew by his silence that he was thinking about her and found that she reveled in it. She didn't know what his thoughts were exactly, didn't care really, just knew they were about her and that was enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he also realized it could never be. Now that she was engaged.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A little. I should really be going in a couple of minutes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought about their conversation at dinner and wondered about loneliness. For some reason she couldn't picture him reading poetry to someone else or even sharing his dreams with another woman. He didn't seem the type. Either that, or she didn't want to believe it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She looked at Noah next. The scar on his face was visible from the side. She wondered if it had happened during the war, then wondered if he'd ever been wounded at all. He hadn't mentioned it and she hadn't asked, mostly because she didn't want to imagine him being hurt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't get up right away. Instead she picked up the cup and drank the last swallow of tea, feeling it warm her throat. She took the evening in. Moon higher now, wind in the trees, temperature dropping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I should go," she finally said, handing the quilt back to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I did, too," she answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't ask why, because she wanted to keep it, too. She readjusted it and crossed her arms afterward to ward off the chill. For some reason, as she stood there she was reminded of standing on her front porch after a high school dance, waiting for a kiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah nodded, then stood without a word. He carried the quilt, and the two of them walked to her car while fallen leaves crunched beneath their feet. She started to take off the shirt he'd loaned her as he opened the door, but he stopped her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keep it," he said. "I want you to have it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A simple question. She knew what the answer should be, especially if she wanted to keep her life simple. "I don't think we should," was all she had to say, and it would end right here and now. But for a second she didn't say anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The demon of choice confronted her then, teased her, challenged her. Why couldn't she say it? She didn't know. But as she looked in his eyes to find the answer she needed, she saw the man she'd once fallen in love with, and suddenly it all came clear.</div>

<div class="line_en">"See you tomorrow," she said, her eyes reflecting the moonlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned away before he could attempt a kiss. She didn't know if he would try but knew for some reason that if he did, she would have a hard time stopping him. She couldn't handle that right now, with everything going through her head. She slid behind the wheel, breathing a sigh of relief. He shut the door for her, and she started the engine. As the car idled, she rolled down the window just a bit.</div>

He watched the car until the lights vanished behind far-off oak trees and the engine noise was gone. Clem wandered up to him and he squatted down to pet her, paying special attention to her neck, scratching the spot she couldn't reach anymore. After he looked up the road one last time, they returned to the back porch side by side.</div>

<div class="line_en">And sometime after midnight on that clear October evening, it all rushed inward and Noah was overcome with longing. And if anyone had seen him, they would have seen what looked like an old man, someone who'd aged a lifetime in just a couple of hours. Someone bent over in his rocker with his face in his hands and tears in his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sat in the rocker again, this time alone, trying once again to fathom the evening that had just passed. Thinking about it. Replaying it. Seeing it again. Hearing it again. Running it by in slow motion. He didn't feel like playing his guitar now, didn't feel like reading. Didn't know what he felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's engaged," he finally whispered, and then was silent for hours, his rocker making the only noise. The night was quiet now, with little activity except for Clem, who visited him occasionally, checking on him as if to ask "Are you all right?"</div>
