<div class="line_en">On a noonday in mid-November, they all sat grouped about the dinner table, eating the last of the dessert concocted by Mammy from corn meal and dried huckleberries, sweetened with sorghum. There was a chill in the air, the first chill of the year, and Pork, standing behind Scarlett's chair, rubbed his hands together in glee and questioned: "Ain' it 'bout time fer de hawg killin', Miss Scarlett?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Eye met eye for a dreadful second around the table before chairs were pushed back and everyone leaped up. Despite the fear that made it shrill, they recognized the voice of Sally Fontaine who, only an hour before, had stopped at Tara for a brief chat on her way to Jonesboro. Now, as they all rushed pell-mell to crowd the front door, they saw her coming up the drive like the wind on a lathered horse, her hair streaming behind her, her bonnet dangling by its ribbons. She did not draw rein but as she galloped madly toward them, she waved her arm back in the direction from which she had come.</div>

<div class="line_en">She sawed savagely at the horse's mouth just in time to swerve him from leaping up the front steps. He swung around sharply, covered the side lawn in three leaps and she put him across the four-foot hedge as if she were on the hunting field.

<div class="line_en">"Mother of God!" cried Scarlett, her eyes meeting Melanie's frightened eyes. For a swift instant there went through her memory again the horrors of her last night in Atlanta, the ruined homes that dotted the countryside, all the stories of rape and torture and murder. She saw again the Yankee soldier standing in the hall with Ellen's sewing box in his hand. She thought: "I shall die. I shall die right here. I thought we were through with all that. I shall die.

<div class="line_en">Then her eyes fell on the horse saddled and hitched and waiting for Pork to ride him to the Tarleton place on an errand. Her horse! Her only horse! The Yankees would take him and the cow and the calf. And the sow and her litter -- Oh, how many tiring hours it had taken to catch that sow and her agile young! And they'd take the rooster and the setting hens and the ducks the Fontaines had given her. And the apples and the yams in the pantry bins. And the flour and rice and dried peas.

Scarlett caught a flashing glimpse of thin legs, a flurry of skirts and underclothing and Melanie was in the saddle, her feet dangling far above the stirrups. She gathered up the reins and clapped her heels against the animal's sides and then abruptly pulled him in, her face twisting with horror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没等她说完最后一句话，媚兰就摆脱韦德的手下了台阶，提着宽阔的裙裾向那匹马跑去了。思嘉匆匆一眼瞥见媚兰那两条瘦腿和飘扬的裙裾和内裤，随即发现她已经跨上马鞍，两只脚垂挂在离马镫很高的地方摆荡着。她迅速拉紧缰绳，用脚后跟在马肋上蹬了几下，那匹马正准备一跃而出，可这时她忽然把马勒住，脸上露出非常惊慌的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She tore open her top bureau drawer and scratched about in the clothing until the Yankee's wallet was in her hand. Hastily she picked up the solitaire ring and the diamond earbobs from where she had hidden them in her sewing basket and shoved them into the wallet. But where to hide it? In the mattress? Up the chimney? Throw it in the well? Put it in her bosom? No, never there! The outlines of the wallet might show through her basque and if the Yankees saw it they would strip her naked and search her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她拉开衣柜顶上的抽屉，在衣服里搜索了一会，找着了那个北方佬的钱包。她急忙从针线篮里取出藏在那里的钻石戒指和耳坠，随即塞进钱包里。可是把钱包藏到哪里好呢？床垫里面？烟囱顶上？扔到井里？或者揣在自己怀里？不，决不能放在这个地方！钱包鼓鼓囊囊的，会从脸衣底下鼓起一大块，要是北方佬看出来了，准会撕开她的衣服来搜呀！">查看中文翻译</div>

Behind her was Pork also carrying two pigs and pushing Gerald before him. Gerald was stumping across the furrows, waving his cane.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she reached the landing, the whole lower floor leaped up at her. All the homely, well-loved articles of furniture seemed to whisper: "Good-by! Good-by!" A sob rose in her throat. There was the open door of the office where Ellen had labored so diligently and she could glimpse a corner of the old secretary. There was the dining room, with chairs pushed awry and food still on the plates. There on the floor were the rag rugs Ellen had dyed and woven herself. And there was the old portrait of Grandma Robillard, with bosoms half bared, hair piled high and nostrils cut so deeply as to give her face a perpetual well-bred sneer. Everything which had been part of her earliest memories, everything bound up with the deepest roots in her: "Good-by! Good-by, Scarlett O'Hara!"</div>

<div class="line_en">That sword was Wade's. It had been his father's and his grandfather's sword and Scarlett had given it to the little boy on his last birthday. They had made quite a ceremony of it and Melanie had cried, cried with tears of pride and sorrowful memory, and kissed him and said he must grow up to be a brave soldier like his father and his grandfather. Wade was very proud of it and often climbed upon the table beneath where it hung to pat it. Scarlett could endure seeing her own possessions going out of the house in hateful alien hands but not this -- not her little boy's pride. Wade, peering from the protection of her skirts at the sound of her cry, found speech and courage in a mighty sob. Stretching out one hand he cried: "Mine!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那把军刀是韦德的，是他从祖父和父亲一代代传下来的，后来思嘉又把它当作生日礼物送给了自己的儿子。授予这生日礼物时还举行了小小的仪式，当时媚兰哭了，她感到又骄傲又伤心，并吻着小韦德说他长大后一定要像父亲和祖父那样做个勇敢的军人。小韦德也颇觉自豪，时常爬到桌上去看挂在墙上的这个纪念物，用小手轻轻抚摩它。思嘉对于她自己的东西给仇人和陌生人抢走还能忍受，可是她孩子的珍贵纪念物就不行了。现在小韦德听见她喊叫，便从她的裙裾里探出头来窥视，并鼓起勇气边哭泣边说起话来。他伸出一只手嚷道：“我的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stood quietly in the hall while the soldiers boiled about her, shouting and cursing. Wade's fingers were in her skirt in a terrified grip. She could feel his body shaking as he pressed against her but she could not bring herself to speak reassuringly to him. She could not bring herself to utter any word to the Yankees, either of pleading, protest or anger. She could only thank God that her knees still had the strength to support her, that her neck was still strong enough to hold her head high. But when a squad of bearded men came lumbering down the steps, laden with an assortment of stolen articles and she saw Charles' sword in the hands of one, she did cry out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她静静地站在穿堂里，眼看着周围的大兵在喊叫咒骂，乱成一团。韦德还是十分害怕，狠狠地抓住她的裙子不放。她感觉到他紧挨着她时身子在索索发抖，可是她自己也没法给他壮胆。她鼓不起勇气来对北方佬说话，无论是祈求、抗议或者表示愤怒。她唯一要感谢上帝的是她两条腿还有力量支撑着她，她的头颈还能把脑袋高高地托着。不过当一小队满脸胡须的人扛着各种各样的东西笨拙地走下楼来，她看见其中有查尔斯的那把军刀时，便不禁大声喊叫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

The sound of the banging sabers and horses' hooves brought little relief and she stood, suddenly weak and nerveless, as they moved off down the avenue, every man laden with stolen goods, clothing, blankets, pictures, hens and ducks, the sow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思嘉低下头，免得让敌人发现她在哭，这时泪水只能缓缓地往婴儿头上滴。她模糊地看见那些人朝门道走去，听见中士用洪亮而粗暴的声音在喊口令。他们动身走了，塔拉农场已经安全了，可是她仍在伤心地回忆爱伦，很难高兴起来。军刀磕碰的声音和马蹄声并没有让她感到安心，她站在那里，突然觉得两腿发软，尽管他们已沿着林荫道渐渐走远了，每个人身上都带着掠夺品，衣服、毯子、图片、鸡鸭，还有那头母猪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was dark, lit as it was by one small window, and so thick with smoke that she was blinded, but she could hear the hiss and crackle of flames. Dashing a hand across her eyes, she peered squinting and saw thin lines of flame creeping across the kitchen floor, toward the walls. Someone had scattered the blazing logs in the open fireplace across the whole room and the tinder-dry pine floor was sucking in the flames and spewing them up like water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨房里黑乎乎的，尽管有个小窗口透进亮光，但烟雾太浓，她什么也看不见，只听到火焰的咝咝声和噼啪声。她一只手遮着眼睛窥视了一下，只见地板上到处有细长的火苗在向墙壁扑去。原来有人把炉子里烧着的木柴丢在地板上，干透了的松木地板便很快着火并到处燃烧起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly she swung about, rigid as a pointer, and stared with horror-struck eyes down the hall, down the covered passageway toward the kitchen. There was smoke coming from the kitchen!</div>

<div class="line_en">Somewhere between the hall and the kitchen, she laid the baby down. Somewhere she flung off Wade's grip, slinging him against the wall. She burst into the smoke-filled kitchen and reeled back, coughing, her eyes streaming tears from the smoke. Again she plunged in, her skirt held over her nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把婴儿随手放在穿堂和厨房之间一个什么地方，随即又甩开韦德的小手，甩得他撞在墙壁上。她冲进烟雾弥漫的厨房，可立即退了回来，连声咳嗽着，呛得眼泪直流。接着，她用裙裾掩住鼻子，又一次冲了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She soused the end of the rug into the bucket and drawing a deep breath plunged again into the smoke-filled room slamming the door behind her. For an eternity she reeled and coughed, beating the rug against the lines of fire that shot swiftly beyond her. Twice her long skirt took fire and she slapped it out with her hands. She could smell the sickening smell of her hair scorching, as it came loose from its pins and swept about her shoulders. The flames raced ever beyond her, toward the walls of the covered runway, fiery snakes that writhed and leaped and, exhaustion sweeping her, she knew that it was hopeless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把地毯的一端浸入水中，然后憋足力气提着它冲进黑烟滚滚的厨房，随手关上了门。似乎过了很久，她在那里摇晃着，咳嗽着，用地毯抽打着一道道的火苗，可不等她抬头火苗又迅速向前蔓延开来。有两次她的长裙着了火，她只得用手把火扑灭了。她闻见自己头发上愈来愈浓的焦臭味，因为头发已完全松散了，披在肩上。火焰总是比她跑得快，向四壁和过道蔓延，像些火蛇似的蜿蜒跳跃，她早已精疲力竭，浑身瘫软，感到完全绝望了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she opened her eyes she was lying on the back porch, her head pillowed comfortably on Melanie's lap, and the afternoon sunlight was shining on her face. Her hands, face and shoulders smarted intolerably from burns. Smoke was still rolling from the quarters, enveloping the cabins in thick clouds, and the smell of burning cotton was strong. Scarlett saw wisps of smoke drifting from the kitchen and she stirred frantically to rise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她睁开眼睛，发现自己舒服地枕着媚兰的大腿，躺在屋后走廊上，午后的太阳在她头上暖和地照着。她的两只手、脸孔和肩膀都严重烧伤了。黑人住宅区还在继续冒烟，把那些棚屋笼罩在浓浓的黑雾里，周围弥漫着棉花燃烧的焦臭味。思嘉看见厨房里还有一缕缕黑烟飘出来，便疯狂地挣扎着想爬起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the door swung open and the sucking draft flung the flames higher. It closed with a bang and, in the swirling smoke, Scarlett, half blind, saw Melanie, stamping her feet on the flames, beating at them with something dark and heavy. She saw her staggering, heard her coughing, caught a lightning-flash glimpse of her set white face and eyes narrow to slits against the smoke, saw her small body curving back and forth as she swung her rug up and down. For another eternity they fought and swayed, side by side, and Scarlett could see that the lines of fire were shortening. Then suddenly Melanie turned toward her and, with a cry, hit her across the shoulders with all her might. Scarlett went down in a whirlwind of smoke and darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时门突然打开，一股气流涌入，火焰蹿得更高。接着砰的一声门又关了，思嘉从烟雾中隐约看见媚兰在用双脚践踏火苗，同时拿着一件又黑又重的东西用力扑打。她看见她跌跌撞撞，听见她连声咳嗽。偶尔还能看见她苍白而坚毅的面孔和冒着浓烟眯得细细的眼睛，看见她举起地毯抽打时那瘦小的身躯一俯一仰地扭动。不知又过了多久，她们两人并肩战斗，极力挣扎，好不容易思嘉才看见那一道道火焰在逐渐缩短了。这时媚兰突然向她回过头来惊叫一声，用尽全身力气从她肩后猛抽了一阵。思嘉在一团浓烟中昏沉沉地倒下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She lay quiet for a moment, eyes closed, sighing with relief, and heard the slobbery gurgle of the baby near by and the reassuring sound of Wade's hiccoughing. So he wasn't dead, thank God! She opened her eyes and looked up into Melanie's face. Her curls were singed, her face black with smut but her eyes were sparkling with excitement and she was smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她这才放心地舒了一口气，闭上眼睛，静静地躺了一会。这时她听见媚兰的婴儿在旁边发出的咯咯声和韦德清晰打嗝的声音。原来他没有死啊，感谢上帝！她睁开眼睛，仰望着媚兰的面孔，只见她的卷发烧焦了，脸上被烟弄得又黑又脏，可是眼睛却神采奕奕，而且还在微笑呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
