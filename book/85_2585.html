<div class="line_en">Down the ridge, Eddie noticed a flickering of colored light that changed rhythmically, every few seconds. He stepped in that direction -- and realized he was ankle-deep in snow. He lifted his foot and shook it hard. The flakes fell loose, glistening with a golden sheen. When he touched them, they were neither cold nor wet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie blinked. He was in the mountains now, but the most remarkable mountains, a range that went on forever, with snow-capped peaks, jagged rocks, and sheer purple slopes. In a flat between two crests was a large, black lake. A moon reflected brightly in its water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪眨了眨眼睛。他这会儿正站在山上，壮丽无比的山脉绵延不断——白雪覆盖的山顶、嶙峋的怪石、陡峭的紫色山坡。两峰之间的平地上，是一片开阔漆黑的湖面，一轮明月映在水中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Where am I now? Eddie thought. Once again, he took stock of his body, pressing on his shoulders, his chest, his stomach. His arm muscles remained tight, but his midsection was looser, flabbier. He hesitated, then squeezed his left knee. It throbbed in pain and Eddie winced. He had hoped upon leaving the Captain that the wound would disappear. Instead, it seemed he was becoming the man he'd been on earth, scars and fat and all. Why would heaven make you relive your own decay?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在在哪里？爱迪心想。他再一次检查自己的身体，用手压了压肩膀、前脚、肚子。他胳膊上的肌肉依然绷得紧紧的，但是，腹部却已经变得邋遢松软。他迟疑片刻，然后，捏了一下他的左膝。一阵刺痛，他畏缩一下。他本来希望离开上尉以后伤痛会消失。然而，他似乎变回了在地球上时的模样，满身伤疤，肥胖丑陋。为什么天堂会让你重温自己的衰老羸弱？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sudden wind lifted Eddie, and he spun like a pocket watch on the end of a chain. An explosion of smoke engulfed him, swallowing his body in a flume of colors. The sky seemed to pull in, until he could feel it touching his skin like a gathered blanket. Then it shot away and exploded into jade. Stars appeared, millions of stars, like salt sprinkled across the greenish firmament.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骤然风起，爱迪被掀到了空中，他像挂在链子上的怀表一样旋转起来。云雾翻腾，将他吞没在一道绚丽的色彩中。天空似乎正在围拢过来，终于像一条毛毯似的将他紧紧裹住。然后，天空又倏地退去，绽出了一片玉绿色。星星出来了，成千上万颗星星，像盐粒一样撒在淡绿色的天幕上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He followed the flickering lights down the narrow ridge. This landscape, stark and silent, was breathtaking, more like how he'd imagined heaven. He wondered, for a moment, if he had somehow finished, if the Captain had been wrong, if there were no more people to meet. He came through the snow around a rock ledge to the large clearing from which the lights originated. He blinked again -- this time in disbelief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪循着飘忽不定的灯光，走下狭窄的山脊。四周空旷寂静的美景令人惊叹，更贴近爱迪想像中的天堂。一时间。他疑惑起来，他是不是已经莫名其妙地走完了最终的旅程，上尉是不是搞错了，他是不是不用再见其他人了。他脚踩着霄，绕过一块突出的岩石，来到一大片空地前，灯光就是从这里放射出来的。爱迪又眨了眨眼睛——这一次，他满腹狐疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie had spent many hours in places like this. They all looked the same -- high-backed booths, shiny countertops, a row of small-parted windows across the front, which, from the outside, made customers appear like riders in a railroad car. Eddie could make out figures through those windows now, people talking and gesturing. He walked up the snowy steps to the double-paned door. He peered inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪过去常常光顾这样的地方。它们都一个模样——高靠背的车厢座、锃亮的台面，以及正面的一排小窗户，从外面看去。里面的客人像坐在一辆火车上。这会儿。爱迪透过这些窗户。着到了里面模糊的身影，人们正在打着手势攀谈着。他走上被雪覆盖的台阶，来到一扇镶有两片玻璃的门前。爱迪朝门里望去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A diner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一家餐车式饭店。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An elderly couple was sitting to his right, eating pie; they took no notice of him. Other customers sat in swivel chairs at the marble counter or inside booths with their coats on hooks. They appeared to be from different decades: Eddie saw a woman with a 1930s high-collared dress and a longhaired young man with a 1960s peace sign tattooed on his arm. Many of the patrons appeared to have been wounded. A black man in a work shirt was missing an arm. A teenage girl had a deep gash across her face. None of them looked over when Eddie rapped on the window. He saw cooks wearing white paper hats, and plates of steaming food on the counter awaiting serving -- food in the most succulent colors: deep red sauces, yellow butter creams. His eyes moved along to the last booth in the right-hand corner. He froze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一对老年夫妇坐在右边，正在吃馅饼，他们没注意到他。其余的客人或者坐在大理石柜台前的转椅上，或者坐在车厢座里。大衣都挂在挂钩上。他们看上去来自不同的时代：爱迪看到一个女人穿着三十年代的高领连衣裙，一个长发年轻人手臂上刺着六十年代的和平标记。许多客人好像都受过伤。一名穿着于作服的黑人男子缺了一只手臂，一个少女脸上有一道深深的刀痕。爱迪在玻璃上敲了几下，但是，没有人朝他这边望。他看到厨师们戴着白色的纸帽子，一碟碟热气腾腾的食物摆在柜台上等着被端走——食物的颜色叫人垂涎欲滴：深红色的酱汁、黄色的奶油乳脂。他的目光移到右边角落最后一个车厢座里。他僵住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There, in the snowy field, sitting by itself, was a boxcar-shaped building with a stainless steel exterior and a red barrel roof. A sign above it blinked the word: "EAT."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," He heard himself whisper. He turned back from the door. He drew deep breaths. His heart pounded. He spun around and looked again, then banged wildly on the windowpanes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”他听到自己低声说。他从门前转过身来。他深吸了几口气。他的心怦怦直跳。他回转身去再看，然后，疯狂地地砸起玻璃窗来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No!" Eddie yelled. "No! No!" He banged until he was sure the glass would break. "No!" He kept yelling until the word he wanted, a word he hadn't spoken in decades, finally formed in his throat. He screamed that word then -- he screamed it so loudly that his head throbbed. But the figure inside the booth remained hunched over, oblivious, one hand resting on the table, the other holding a cigar, never looking up, no matter how many times Eddie howled it, over and over again: "Dad! Dad! Dad!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”爱迪大叫着。“不！不，”他拼命地砸着，直到他觉得玻璃窗都快被他砸碎了。“不！”他不停地叫喊着，直到他想要的那个字，那个几十年以来他都没有用过的字，终于在他的喉咙里出现了。他喊着那个字——喊得那么响。头都快裂了。但是，车厢座里的那个人仍然伏在桌子上，不理不睬，他的一只手搭在桌子上，另一只手举着一根雪茄，尽管爱迪一遍又一遍地呼唤，他连一次头都没有抬起来。爱迪喊着：“爸！爸！爸！”">查看中文翻译</div>
