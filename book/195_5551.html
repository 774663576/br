<div class="line_en">But about three in the morning Philip awoke and could not sleep again. He began to think of Mildred. He tried not to, but could not help himself. He repeated to himself the same thing time after time till his brain reeled. It was inevitable that she should marry: life was hard for a girl who had to earn her own living; and if she found someone who could give her a comfortable home she should not be blamed if she accepted. Philip acknowledged that from her point of view it would have been madness to marry him: only love could have made such poverty bearable, and she did not love him. It was no fault of hers; it was a fact that must be accepted like any other. Philip tried to reason with himself. He told himself that deep down in his heart was mortified pride; his passion had begun in wounded vanity, and it was this at bottom which caused now a great part of his wretchedness. He despised himself as much as he despised her. Then he made plans for the future, the same plans over and over again, interrupted by recollections of kisses on her soft pale cheek and by the sound of her voice with its trailing accent; he had a great deal of work to do, since in the summer he was taking chemistry as well as the two examinations he had failed in. He had separated himself from his friends at the hospital, but now he wanted companionship. There was one happy occurrence: Hayward a fortnight before had written to say that he was passing through London and had asked him to dinner; but Philip, unwilling to be bothered, had refused. He was coming back for the season, and Philip made up his mind to write to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had looked forward with apprehension to the day on which Mildred was to be married; he was expecting an intolerable anguish; and it was with relief that he got a letter from Hayward on Saturday morning to say that he was coming up early on that very day and would fetch Philip to help him to find rooms. Philip, anxious to be distracted, looked up a time-table and discovered the only train Hayward was likely to come by; he went to meet him, and the reunion of the friends was enthusiastic. They left the luggage at the station, and set off gaily. Hayward characteristically proposed that first of all they should go for an hour to the National Gallery; he had not seen pictures for some time, and he stated that it needed a glimpse to set him in tune with life. Philip for months had had no one with whom he could talk of art and books. Since the Paris days Hayward had immersed himself in the modern French versifiers, and, such a plethora of poets is there in France, he had several new geniuses to tell Philip about. They walked through the gallery pointing out to one another their favourite pictures; one subject led to another; they talked excitedly. The sun was shining and the air was warm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他惴惴不安地等待着米尔德里德大喜之日的到来，真等到那天，也许就能体味什么是万箭穿心的痛苦。幸运的是，礼拜六一早他接到海沃德的回信，说很快就到伦敦了，希望菲利普能来车站接他，帮他安排住处。菲利普巴不得能干点什么分散精力，查了火车时刻表，找到唯一一班海沃德可能乘坐的车次，兴冲冲地去火车站接他。老友重逢自然不胜激动。他俩把行李寄存在车站，欢天喜地地离开。海沃德还是老样子，提议先去国家美术馆一个钟头。他已经很久没赏过画了，为了和伦敦生活顺利接轨，就得先去画廊看上一看。菲利普也好几个月没找到能在一块谈谈艺术、文学的伙伴了。在巴黎的这段日子里，海沃德一直潜心研究法国当代诗人的作品。在法国，最不缺的就是诗人，他认识了几个新兴的天才诗人想和菲利普讨论一番。两个人在美术馆里一面走一面把自己喜欢的画指给对方看，可以谈的话题一个接着一个根本说不完。窗外和风拂面，阳光普照。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was thankful when eight o'clock struck and he could get up. He was pale and weary. But when he had bathed, dressed, and had breakfast, he felt himself joined up again with the world at large; and his pain was a little easier to bear. He did not feel like going to lectures that morning, but went instead to the Army and Navy Stores to buy Mildred a wedding-present. After much wavering he settled on a dressing-bag. It cost twenty pounds, which was much more than he could afford, but it was showy and vulgar: he knew she would be aware exactly how much it cost; he got a melancholy satisfaction in choosing a gift which would give her pleasure and at the same time indicate for himself the contempt he had for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八点了，菲利普心怀感激：终于能起床。他站起身，脸色灰白，神情萧索。洗过澡，穿戴妥当，吃过早饭后，才又觉得自己重新在这世上活过来些，痛苦也不再那么难以忍受。他不想上课，跑到海陆军商场给米尔德里德买结婚礼物。挑来挑去，相中了一个化妆包。这个包要二十镑，远远超出了他能承受的范围，但是看上去精美华丽、俗里俗气，想必她看一眼就能猜出价格。菲利普既满意又有些淡淡的忧伤，这件用来讨她欢心的礼物却带着对她的鄙视，多大的讽刺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went to an Italian restaurant for luncheon and ordered themselves a fiaschetto of Chianti. Lingering over the meal they talked on. They reminded one another of the people they had known at Heidelberg, they spoke of Philip's friends in Paris, they talked of books, pictures, morals, life; and suddenly Philip heard a clock strike three. He remembered that by this time Mildred was married. He felt a sort of stitch in his heart, and for a minute or two he could not hear what Hayward was saying. But he filled his glass with Chianti. He was unaccustomed to alcohol and it had gone to his head. For the time at all events he was free from care. His quick brain had lain idle for so many months that he was intoxicated now with conversation. He was thankful to have someone to talk to who would interest himself in the things that interested him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们去一家意大利馆子吃午饭，点了瓶意大利葡萄酒。饭桌上又谈了许多，回忆之前在海德堡的那些伙伴，又聊起菲利普在巴黎结交的朋友。他们谈到了文学、绘画、道德、生活。钟声忽然敲响三下，米尔德里德就在这一刻出嫁了。菲利普忽然痛得喘不过气，两耳轰鸣，有那么一两分钟甚至听不到海沃德在说什么。他干了满满一杯葡萄酒。本来酒量就不大，酒劲儿一下就上头了。他觉得自己终于摆脱烦扰，彻底解放了。他敏捷的头脑已经好几个月没有派上用场了，这下终于能无拘无束地畅聊痛快。有位志趣相投的知己真是人生一大幸事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The spring was pleasant there. It was a day upon which one felt it good merely to live. The young green of the trees was exquisite against the sky; and the sky, pale and blue, was dappled with little white clouds. At the end of the ornamental water was the gray mass of the Horse Guards. The ordered elegance of the scene had the charm of an eighteenth-century picture. It reminded you not of Watteau, whose landscapes are so idyllic that they recall only the woodland glens seen in dreams, but of the more prosaic Jean-Baptiste Pater. Philip's heart was filled with lightness. He realised, what he had only read before, that art (for there was art in the manner in which he looked upon nature) might liberate the soul from pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公园里春意融融。这样的日子里生活似乎都美好起来。树上新抽的枝丫在万里晴空的映衬下格外娇嫩，透明澄蓝的天空上白云点点，一弯秀水的一侧是群穿灰色制服的禁卫骑兵。美景良辰井然有序，竟像一幅十八世纪的画作。这样的景色不会使人想到华多，他的画田园气息过浓，画中的幽谷林地似乎只能相见在梦中，反而是让·巴蒂斯特·帕特尔平淡无奇的风格才与这样的景致契合。菲利普心里轻快许多，原来正如在书里读过的那样，艺术（他看待自然的角度本身即是一种艺术）能拯救灵魂于水火之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I remember when first I went to Paris, Clutton, I think it was, gave a long discourse on the subject that beauty is put into things by painters and poets. They create beauty. In themselves there is nothing to choose between the Campanile of Giotto and a factory chimney. And then beautiful things grow rich with the emotion that they have aroused in succeeding generations. That is why old things are more beautiful than modern. The Ode on a Grecian Urn is more lovely now than when it was written, because for a hundred years lovers have read it and the sick at heart taken comfort in its lines."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还记得我刚到巴黎的时候，克拉顿，没错，应该是他，发表了一通长篇大论。说什么美是画家和诗人创造出来的。在这些人眼里，乔托设计的钟楼和工厂的烟囱没什么两样。正是随后一代又一代人的热情才使这些美好的事物更添光彩。所以过去的东西总是比现在的美丽啊！《希腊古瓮颂》现在读起来比刚写成的时候更美，正是因为一个世纪以来，数不清的痴男怨女朗朗诵读过它，绝望伤心的人也从它的词句间得到了慰藉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip left Hayward to infer what in the passing scene had suggested these words to him, and it was a delight to know that he could safely leave the inference. It was in sudden reaction from the life he had been leading for so long that he was now deeply affected. The delicate iridescence of the London air gave the softness of a pastel to the gray stone of the buildings; and in the wharfs and storehouses there was the severity of grace of a Japanese print. They went further down; and the splendid channel, a symbol of the great empire, broadened, and it was crowded with traffic; Philip thought of the painters and the poets who had made all these things so beautiful, and his heart was filled with gratitude. They came to the Pool of London, and who can describe its majesty? The imagination thrills, and Heaven knows what figures people still its broad stream, Doctor Johnson with Boswell by his side, an old Pepys going on board a man-o'-war: the pageant of English history, and romance, and high adventure. Philip turned to Hayward with shining eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两岸闪过的景色能使这番话品出怎样一种滋味，菲利普只让海沃德自己去想。他发现海沃德对自己的暗示毫无察觉，心中不免暗喜。一路走来，见了、听了许多，忽然对自己的生活有所感悟。伦敦的空气清新而斑斓，给灰沉的建筑蒙了一层柔和光晕。岸边的库房、码头像日本版画一样优雅庄重。他们顺水而下，壮阔的泰晤士河道是大英帝国的标识，一路越行越宽，船只络绎不绝。菲利普想到了画家和诗人，正是多亏了他们的创作，这方秀丽的景致才得以更加动人心弦。他的心中充满了感激之情。汽艇到了伦敦池，即便有支生花妙笔，怕是也难以形容出这里的壮丽辉煌吧！菲利普思绪飞驰，也许只有上帝才知道是什么让人们把这浩浩汤汤的河面变得平如明镜，是什么让约翰逊和鲍斯威尔相伴始终，是什么让老佩皮斯踏上军舰——正是大英帝国灿烂的历史，是浪漫的际遇和刺激的冒险啊！菲利普看着海沃德，眼睛闪闪发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
