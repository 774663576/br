<div class="line_en">Godfrey Cass was waiting at the door for the only guest he cared about, Nancy Lammeter. Finally she arrived, sitting be hind her father on his horse, looking more beautiful than ever. Her lovely face blushed as she saw Godfrey come forward to lift her down from the horse. "Why is he waiting for me?" she thought. "I thought I made it clear to him that I'll never marry him. People say he leads a bad life, and I can't marry a man like that."</div>

<div class="line_en">Upstairs, the ladies were excitedly putting on their best dresses, while talking to each other all the time. Nancy met her aunt, Mrs Osgood, who introduced her to some visitors of hers. The Misses Gunn were two young ladies who were not beautiful, but dressed very fashionably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼上，女士们一边不停地聊天一边换上最漂亮的衣服。南茜遇到了姨妈奥斯古德太太，姨妈把自己的客人介绍给她，其中有两位年轻女士，甘氏姐妹，她们不太漂亮但穿得很时髦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then Nancy's older sister Priscilla arrived. She was a large, cheerful girl, with a round face and a nose pink with cold. As they were changing their clothes, Priscilla said to Mrs Osgood, "Look at our dresses, aunt! Of course Nancy looks beautiful in hers, but this colour makes me look yellow! Nancy says we must wear the same dresses, because we're sisters, although I'm five years older! I'm ugly, I know I am. But I don't mind!" she turned to Mrs Osgood's two visitors. "In my opinion the pretty girls are useful -- I'm sure you agree -- to catch the men. I don't think men are worth worrying about. Any woman with a good father and a good home had better stay single. That's what I'm going to do, anyway. We ugly girls don't need husbands!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时南茜的姐姐普丽西拉来了，她是个快活的圆脸大个子女孩，鼻子冻得红红的。换衣服时，普丽西拉对奥斯古德太太说：“看我们的衣服，姨妈，南茜穿起来当然漂亮，可我穿起来太老了！南茜说我们是姐妹，要穿一样的衣服，尽管我比她大5岁！我知道我丑，可是我不在乎。”她又转向姨妈的两个朋友，“我想你们也同意女孩子漂亮就容易抓住男人的心，我可不在乎男人。有个好爸爸、好家庭的女人最好单身。我就打算这样。我们丑姑娘不需要丈夫。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Godfrey made no reply, and avoided looking at Nancy. There was too much he wanted to say to her. But the Squire, who always enjoyed his parties and was feeling extremely cheerful, was rather impatient with his son. He thought he had better speak, if Godfrey was too shy to do it himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈弗雷没有回答，也尽量不去看南茜。他有太多的话想对她说。可这时对晚会心满意足的乡绅对自己的儿子有些不耐烦了。他认为既然儿子太害羞张不开嘴，那么自己最好亲自说了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although Priscilla was right in saying she was not good-looking, she was very popular among her neighbours because she was so cheerful and sensible. And Nancy was not only considered to be the most beautiful girl in and around Raveloe, but also one of the most intelligent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Seats at the dining-table had been kept for the Lammeter sisters. Priscilla was taken to sit between her father and the Squire. Nancy felt herself blushing again as Godfrey Cass came to lead her to a seat between himself and the vicar, Mr Crackenthorp She knew that if she married Godfrey, she would one day be the most important woman in Raveloe, the Squire's wife But she repeated firmly to herself that she could not marry a man of bad character.</div>

<div class="line_en">While they were eating and drinking, people around the table were listening with interest to the Squire's words. "Perhaps Godfrey will marry Nancy after all!" the vicar's wife whispered to Mrs Osgood. Mr Lammeter's back was very straight as he looked across the table at his daughter. He was a serious, careful gentleman, who considered the Lammeters a better family than the Casses. He had already decided that Godfrey must change his way of life before Nancy could possibly marry him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桌上所有的人都在一边用餐一边饶有兴趣地听着乡绅的话。“大概戈弗雷还是会娶南茜！”牧师的太太小声对奥斯古德太太说。拉默特先生在桌子对面笔直地坐着，看着女儿。这是一位严肃谨慎的绅士，他认为拉默特家比凯斯家还要好。他早就决定在戈弗雷痛改前非之前不会把南茜嫁给戈弗雷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come, come, Kimble," said the Squire, "let the young ones enjoy themselves. My son Godfrey'll be angry if you take Miss Nancy away. I expect he's asked her for the first dance already. Haven't you, Godfrey?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行了，金布尔，”乡绅插了进来，“让年轻人玩他们的吧！你把南茜小姐带走，我儿子戈弗雷会生气的。我想他已经邀请南茜小姐和他跳第一支舞了，是不是戈弗雷？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the dance went on, Godfrey felt happier and happier. Holding Nancy in his arms, he forgot all his problems. Suddenly the Squire's heavy foot stood on part of Nancy's dress, and some of the material was pulled away at the waist. Nancy asked Godfrey to take her to a quieter place, where she could repair the damage. He took her to a small room near the hall, hoping they would have a few private moments together. But Nancy sat down on the chair furthest away from him, and said coldly, "Thank you, sir. You needn't stay. I'm very sorry about taking you away from the dance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跳着舞，戈弗雷感到越来越幸福。搂着南茜，他忘掉了一切烦恼。忽然乡绅的脚重重地踩住了南茜的长裙，把衣服腰间的部分扯坏了。南茜让戈弗雷带她到一个清静的地方去整理衣服。戈弗雷把她带进了大厅旁边的一间小屋，希望他们能够有一段单独相处的时间。可南茜坐在了离他最远的椅子上，冷冷地说：“谢谢您，先生，您不必呆在这儿，很抱歉让您从舞会上出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will," answered Nancy coldly. She was still sure she would not marry him, but she wanted to remain polite.</div>

The small village band was already playing, as the Squire led the vicar's wife to the end of the hall to start the dance. They were followed by Godfrey and Nancy, and the other ladies and gentlemen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客人们一对对或三五成群地起身走到大厅里，舞会要开始了。在乡村小乐队的伴奏下，乡绅把牧师的太太领到大厅的尽头带头跳起来，接下来是戈弗雷和南茜，然后是其他客人们。">查看中文翻译</div>
