<div class="line_en">What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until Peter Walsh said, "Musing among the vegetables?"-- was that it?--"I prefer men to cauliflowers"-- was that it? He must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace -- Peter Walsh. He would be back from India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished -- how strange it was!-- a few sayings like this about cabbages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多么新鲜！多么刺激！这样的感觉似乎总能让她回想起过去。她此刻仿佛就能听见，在铰链微弱的嘎吱声里，她猛然推开一扇落地窗，就此投入伯尔顿[1]的大自然里。多么清爽，多么安稳，那时候的清晨，当然要比此时更为宁静，如海浪的起伏，如浪花的轻吻，寒凉、清冽，甚至有点肃穆的味道（对她这个当时才十八岁的姑娘家来说）。那时的她站在打开的窗户前，感觉好像有什么不祥之事即将发生。她看着花，看着烟雾缭绕的树，看着飞起又飞落的白嘴鸦。她站在那儿，痴痴地看着，直到彼德·沃尔什说：“在菜园子里沉思呢？”——是这么说的吗？——“与花椰菜比，我更喜欢人。”——是这么说的吗？他一定是在那天早上吃早饭时说的这些，当时她已走到外面的露台上——这个彼德·沃尔什。他很快就要从印度回来了，是六月还是七月呢，她记不清了，因为他的信写得实在是乏味。但他说的话却能够让人记住，还有他的眼睛、他的小刀、他的微笑、他的火爆脾气，还有…成千上万桩往事都已忘得干干净净——真是不可思议！——却偏偏记住了卷心菜之类的只言片语。【注：【1】达洛维夫人婚前在乡下的庄园名。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass. A charming woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the jay, blue-green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white since her illness. There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very upright.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在路边挺了挺胸，等着德特纳尔公司的货车驶过。一个迷人的女子，斯克罗普·帕维斯这么认为（他了解她，就像他们是同住在威斯敏斯特的隔壁邻居）。她身上有种小鸟的气质，像一只蓝绿的鲣鸟，轻盈、活跃，尽管她已五十出头，而且因疾病缠身而面色苍白。她停在那里，压根没瞧见他。她挺直身子，准备过马路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For having lived in Westminster -- how many years now? over twenty,-- one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can't be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that very reason: they love life. In people's eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于一直居住在威斯敏斯特——多少年来着？有二十多年了吧——即便是在车来人往中或夜半醒来时，克拉丽莎都会确信人们会感觉到一种特别的宁静与肃穆，一种难以形容的停滞感，在大本钟敲响之前的焦虑感（不过，人们说那也许是因为她的心脏受到了流感的影响）。听哪！钟声隆隆。先是提示音，音色悦耳，再是报时声，势如破竹。沉重的钟声在空中环绕，直至消逝。我们多傻呀，她寻思着，穿过了维多利亚大街。只有天知道，为什么人们如此热爱生活，如此看待她，甚至要虚构她，不懈地美化她，然后又粉碎她，从而创造出每时每刻的新鲜感来。即使是邋遢透顶的女人，坐在门前台阶上那些最悲伤绝望的人们（酗酒使他们穷困潦倒）也一样。也正是因为这个原因，就连议会制定的清规戒律也奈何不得他们：人们都热爱生活。对此，她深信不疑。在人们的眼中，在人们或轻盈或沉重或艰难的步伐中，在咆哮与喧嚣中，在马车、汽车、大巴、货车和身前背后挂着广告牌摇摇晃晃蹒跚而行的人中，在铜管乐队中，在管风琴中，在欢庆声中，在叮当声中，在头顶上一架飞机发出的奇特而尖利的呼啸声中，有着她热爱的一切：生活、伦敦，还有六月的这一刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For it was the middle of June. The War was over, except for some one like Mrs. Foxcroft at the Embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old Manor House must go to a cousin; or Lady Bexborough who opened a bazaar, they said, with the telegram in her hand, John, her favourite, killed; but it was over; thank Heaven -- over. It was June. The King and Queen were at the Palace. And everywhere, though it was still so early, there was a beating, a stirring of galloping ponies, tapping of cricket bats; Lords, Ascot, Ranelagh and all the rest of it; wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey-blue morning air, which, as the day wore on, would unwind them, and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies, whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung, the whirling young men, and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who, even now, after dancing all night, were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run; and even now, at this hour, discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery; and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds, their lovely old sea- green brooches in eighteenth-century settings to tempt Americans (but one must economise, not buy things rashly for Elizabeth), and she, too, loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion, being part of it, since her people were courtiers once in the time of the Georges, she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party. But how strange, on entering the Park, the silence; the mist; the hum; the slow-swimming happy ducks; the pouched birds waddling; and who should be coming along with his back against the Government buildings, most appropriately, carrying a despatch box stamped with the Royal Arms, who but Hugh Whitbread; her old friend Hugh -- the admirable Hugh!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="已是六月中旬，战争结束了，只有像福克斯克罗夫特夫人那样的人还依然故我，她昨晚在大使馆里还是一副伤心欲绝的样子，因为她的宝贝儿子阵亡了，现在那座古老的庄园势必要落入她侄子之手了；还有贝克斯伯罗女士，人们说在她主持那场义卖开幕时，她手里还拽着那张宣告她爱子约翰战死的电报。不过战争毕竟结束了，感谢上帝——终于结束了。已经是六月了。国王与王后还好好地待在王宫里。尽管还是大清早，飞奔的赛马那欢快的嘚嘚声已是随处可闻，还有板球拍的扣击声。洛兹板球场、爱斯科特赛马场、拉内拉赫马球场，以及所有的游乐场所，都被笼罩在灰蓝的晨雾织出的一张柔网中。随着白昼的推进，晨雾将会散尽，草坪与球场上将会出现腾跃的赛马，它们的前蹄才刚着地就又迫不及待地跳起来。还有飞奔着的小伙子，欢笑着的姑娘们，她们穿着透明的薄衫，在通宵的舞会之后，此时也照样牵出怪模怪样的小毛狗出来溜达了。即使现在，在这么一个大清早，严谨刻板的老贵妇们也乘上了自己的汽车，飞驰着去完成她们那神秘的使命。店主们在忙乱地布置橱窗，将一枚枚钻石、人造宝石，还有海绿色的可爱的旧胸针放置在十八世纪式样的底座上，用来吸引美国佬（不过克拉丽莎必须节约，不能随便为伊丽莎白买这买那），可克拉丽莎自己也怀着可笑的热情，打心眼里喜欢这些珠宝，她属于这种生活，因为她的祖先曾是乔治王朝时期的大臣，而且，她要把自己打扮得光彩照人，在这个特别的晚上举行她的派对。可奇怪的是，一走进公园，她就置身于一片静谧中。薄雾迷离，远处传来低沉的嗡嗡声，快乐的鸭子在水中缓缓地游弋，大喉袋的鸟儿摇摇摆摆。那个背朝着政府大楼走过来的人会是谁呢。只见他手里提着一只印有皇家徽章的配送箱，真是再合适不过了，除了休·惠特布莱德还会是谁呢。她的老朋友休——令人赞赏的休！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had just come up -- unfortunately -- to see doctors. Other people came to see pictures; go to the opera; take their daughters out; the Whitbreads came "to see doctors." Times without number Clarissa had visited Evelyn Whitbread in a nursing home. Was Evelyn ill again? Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well-covered, manly, extremely handsome, perfectly upholstered body (he was almost too well dressed always, but presumably had to be, with his little job at Court) that his wife had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend, Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify. Ah yes, she did of course; what a nuisance; and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat. Not the right hat for the early morning, was that it? For Hugh always made her feel, as he bustled on, raising his hat rather extravagantly and assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen, and of course he was coming to her party to-night, Evelyn absolutely insisted, only a little late he might be after the party at the Palace to which he had to take one of Jim's boys,-- she always felt a little skimpy beside Hugh; schoolgirlish; but attached to him, partly from having known him always, but she did think him a good sort in his own way, though Richard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him.</div>

When his old mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to Bath he did it, without a word; he was really unselfish, and as for saying, as Peter did, that he had no heart, no brain, nothing but the manners and breeding of an English gentleman, that was only her dear Peter at his worst; and he could be intolerable; he could be impossible; but adorable to walk with on a morning like this.</div>

<div class="line_en">For they might be parted for hundreds of years, she and Peter; she never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks; but suddenly it would come over her, If he were with me now what would he say?-- some days, some sights bringing him back to her calmly, without the old bitterness; which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people; they came back in the middle of St. James's Park on a fine morning -- indeed they did. But Peter -- however beautiful the day might be, and the trees and the grass, and the little girl in pink -- Peter never saw a thing of all that. He would put on his spectacles, if she told him to; he would look. It was the state of the world that interested him; Wagner, Pope's poetry, people's characters eternally, and the defects of her own soul. How he scolded her! How they argued! She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase; the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her bedroom), she had the makings of the perfect hostess, he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">So she would still find herself arguing in St. James's Park, still making out that she had been right -- and she had too -- not to marry him. For in marriage a little licence, a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house; which Richard gave her, and she him. (Where was he this morning for instance? Some committee, she never asked what.) But with Peter everything had to be shared; everything gone into. And it was intolerable, and when it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain, she had to break with him or they would have been destroyed, both of them ruined, she was convinced; though she had borne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart the grief, the anguish; and then the horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat going to India! Never should she forget all that! Cold, heartless, a prude, he called her. Never could she understand how he cared. But those Indian women did presumably -- silly, pretty, flimsy nincompoops. And she wasted her pity. For he was quite happy, he assured her -- perfectly happy, though he had never done a thing that they talked of; his whole life had been a failure. It made her angry still.</div>

Devonshire House, Bath House, the house with the china cockatoo, she had seen them all lit up once; and remembered Sylvia, Fred, Sally Seton -- such hosts of people; and dancing all night; and the waggons plodding past to market; and driving home across the Park. She remembered once throwing a shilling into the Serpentine. But every one remembered; what she loved was this, here, now, in front of her; the fat lady in the cab. Did it matter then, she asked herself, walking towards Bond Street, did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must go on without her; did she resent it; or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely? but that somehow in the streets of London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there, she survived, Peter survived, lived in each other, she being part, she was positive, of the trees at home; of the house there, ugly, rambling all to bits and pieces as it was; part of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life, herself. But what was she dreaming as she looked into Hatchards' shop window? What was she trying to recover? What image of white dawn in the country, as she read in the book spread open:</div>

<div class="line_en">There were Jorrocks' Jaunts and Jollities; there were Soapy Sponge and Mrs. Asquith's Memoirs and Big Game Shooting in Nigeria, all spread open. Ever so many books there were; but none that seemed exactly right to take to Evelyn Whitbread in her nursing home. Nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried-up little woman look, as Clarissa came in, just for a moment cordial; before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women's ailments. How much she wanted it -- that people should look pleased as she came in, Clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards Bond Street, annoyed, because it was silly to have other reasons for doing things. Much rather would she have been one of those people like Richard who did things for themselves, whereas, she thought, waiting to cross, half the time she did things not simply, not for themselves; but to make people think this or that; perfect idiocy she knew (and now the policeman held up his hand) for no one was ever for a second taken in. Oh if she could have had her life over again! she thought, stepping on to the pavement, could have looked even differently!</div>

<div class="line_en">She would have been, in the first place, dark like Lady Bexborough, with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes. She would have been, like Lady Bexborough, slow and stately; rather large; interested in politics like a man; with a country house; very dignified, very sincere. Instead of which she had a narrow pea- stick figure; a ridiculous little face, beaked like a bird's. That she held herself well was true; and had nice hands and feet; and dressed well, considering that she spent little. But often now this body she wore (she stopped to look at a Dutch picture), this body, with all its capacities, seemed nothing -- nothing at all. She had the oddest sense of being herself invisible; unseen; unknown; there being no more marrying, no more having of children now, but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them, up Bond Street, this being Mrs. Dalloway; not even Clarissa any more; this being Mrs. Richard Dalloway.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is all," she said, looking at the fishmonger's. "That is all," she repeated, pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where, before the War, you could buy almost perfect gloves. And her old Uncle William used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves. He had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the War. He had said, "I have had enough." Gloves and shoes; she had a passion for gloves; but her own daughter, her Elizabeth, cared not a straw for either of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就这些，”她看着卖鱼的摊子，自语道。“就这些，”她在手套店的橱窗前停留了片刻，再次说道。战前，你可以在那里买到几近完美的手套。她的威廉大叔以前常这么说，通过鞋子和手套你就能看出一个姑娘是否是淑女。在战争中的某天早上，大叔突然去世了。他曾说过：“我已经活够了。”手套与鞋子，她尤其喜欢手套。但她的亲生女儿，她的伊丽莎白，却对这两样全无兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not a straw, she thought, going on up Bond Street to a shop where they kept flowers for her when she gave a party. Elizabeth really cared for her dog most of all. The whole house this morning smelt of tar. Still, better poor Grizzle than Miss Kilman; better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book! Better anything, she was inclined to say. But it might be only a phase, as Richard said, such as all girls go through. It might be falling in love. But why with Miss Kilman? who had been badly treated of course; one must make allowances for that, and Richard said she was very able, had a really historical mind. Anyhow they were inseparable, and Elizabeth, her own daughter, went to Communion; and how she dressed, how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a bit, it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people callous (so did causes); dulled their feelings, for Miss Kilman would do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians, but in private inflicted positive torture, so insensitive was she, dressed in a green mackintosh coat. Year in year out she wore that coat; she perspired; she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were; how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it, her dismissal from school during the War -- poor embittered unfortunate creature! For it was not her one hated but the idea of her, which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night; one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life-blood, dominators and tyrants; for no doubt with another throw of the dice, had the black been uppermost and not the white, she would have loved Miss Kilman! But not in this world. No.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全无兴趣，她一边想着，一边沿邦德街向一家花店走去。她每次举办派对，他们都会为她把花留好。而伊丽莎白最关心的是她的小狗，真的。今天早上，整幢房子里都闻得到一股柏油味。不过，可怜的小狗灰灰总比基尔曼小姐要好一点。犬热症、柏油，以及所有的不适，也总比枯坐在闷热的卧室里抱着本祈祷书要好！随便什么都比那好，她想这么说。可这也许只是人生的一个阶段，就像理查德说过的，每个姑娘都会经历这样一个阶段。也许是因为坠入了爱河。可为什么恋爱的对象偏偏是基尔曼小姐呢？当然，基尔曼小姐以前曾遭受过虐待，所以我们必须对她多加体谅，而且理查德说过她是个很有能力的人，有着不折不扣的历史学家的头脑。总之，她俩已到了形影不离的程度，而伊丽莎白，她的亲生女儿，还去参加了圣餐礼呢。克拉丽莎应该如何穿着打扮，应该以何种态度来面对那些前来领圣餐的人们，这些她都满不在乎，她的阅历告诉她痴迷于宗教会使人的性情变得冷淡（痴迷于任何事业都会如此），他们的感觉会变得迟钝。就拿基尔曼小姐来说吧，她愿意为俄罗斯人奉献一切，愿意为奥地利人忍饥挨饿，可在日常生活中她又绝对是个让人受不了的角色。她迟钝乏味，总是穿着她那件防水布的绿大衣。她年复一年穿着那件大衣，她浑身冒汗，只要她在房间里待上五分钟，你就准保会感受到她的崇高、你的渺小；感受到她是多么贫穷，你是多么富有；感受到她在没有一张垫子或床铺或地毯或随便什么的贫民窟里是怎么生活的。她的整个灵魂因浸泡在悲惨世界里而遭到了腐蚀，在战争期间她被学校免职了——这个可怜巴巴的、满心委屈的、不幸的女人啊！其实，人家讨厌的不是她这个人，而是她的那些个想法，它们会聚在一起，无疑会成为一种巨大的威胁，但威胁并非来自基尔曼小姐本人，而是她的思想。她的思想如人们在黑夜里与之搏斗的鬼魂，如骑在我们头上吮吸掉我们一半鲜血的鬼魂，如蛮不讲理的统治者、暴君。不容置疑的是，如果我们重新掷一回骰子，如果黑色取代白色成为了一切的主宰，她就会爱上基尔曼小姐的！可这个世界的现实并非如此。并非如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

And then, opening her eyes, how fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked; and dark and prim the red carnations, holding their heads up; and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow white, pale -- as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer's day, with its almost blue-black sky, its delphiniums, its carnations, its arum lilies was over; and it was the moment between six and seven when every flower -- roses, carnations, irises, lilac -- glows; white, violet, red, deep orange; every flower seems to burn by itself, softly, purely in the misty beds; and how she loved the grey-white moths spinning in and out, over the cherry pie, over the evening primroses!</div>
