<div class="line_en">Some people feel embarrassed or resentful when I suggest that they may be self-defeatingly tied to their parents. Please remember that this is a common struggle. Few people are sufficiently evolved to be completely "in charge" of their own lives and totally free of the need for parental approval. Most of us have left home physically, but very few of us have left home emotionally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Children of toxic parents have so much need for parental approval that it prevents them from living the lives they desire. It's true that most adults have at least some ongoing enmeshment with their parents. If asked, "Are you able to have your own thoughts, actions, and feelings without in any way considering your parents' hopes or expectations?" few could answer with a categorical "yes." In fact, in a healthy family, some amount of enmeshment is beneficial. It helps to create feelings of belonging, of family communion. Even in healthy families, however, that influence can go too far. And in toxic families it goes right off the scale.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">To help you determine how enmeshed you still are with your parents, I have designed three checklists, one for beliefs, one for feelings, and one for behaviors. Use them as catalysts to help you uncover your self-constricting beliefs, feelings, and behaviors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are basically two types of enmeshment. The first involves continually giving in to your parents in order to placate them. No matter what your own needs or desires, your parents' needs and desires always come first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second type involves doing just the opposite. You may be just as enmeshed if you scream at, threaten, or become totally alienated from your parents. In this case, as contradictory as it may seem, your parents still have enormous control over how you feel and behave. As long as you continue to react so strongly to them, you give them the power to upset you, which allows them to control you.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">As we saw in chapter 8, beliefs are deeply ingrained attitudes, perceptions, and concepts about people, relationships, and morality. Before you can begin any process of growth and change in your life, it is essential that you first become aware of the connection between erroneous beliefs, negative feelings, and self-defeating behaviors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here's how it works: a belief like, "I can't ever win, my parents have all the power," will probably lead you to feel helpless, afraid, frustrated, and overwhelmed. In an effort to defend against these feelings, you will automatically back down in disagreements, give in to your parents' wishes, and perhaps use drugs or alcohol in an attempt to avoid these feelings altogether. It all starts with beliefs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">-- It is up to me to make my parents happy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This first checklist will help you identify some of the beliefs that underlie your feelings and behaviors. Put a mark next to each statement that rings true for you.</div>

<div class="line_en">If four or more of these beliefs apply to you, you are still very enmeshed with your parents. As hard as it may be to accept, all of these beliefs are self-defeating.

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">Several of these beliefs put full responsibility on your shoulders for how your parents feel. When toxic parents feel bad, they often look for others to blame, and those others are usually their children. If you were made to believe that your parents' feelings were your responsibility, you probably still believe that it's within your power to "make" them -- and often everyone else -- either happy or sad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For example, if you do something that is neither cruel nor abusive but nevertheless makes your mother feel sad -- such as marrying someone she disapproves of or taking a job out of town -- it is up to your mother to find ways to feel better. It's perfectly appropriate for you to say something like, "I'm sorry you're upset," but it is not your responsibility to change your plans for the sole purpose of taking care of your mother's feelings. When you ignore your needs for the sake of your mother's feelings, you are doing a disservice not only to yourself but to your mother, as well. The anger and resentment that you will inevitably feel cannot help but affect your relationship. And if your efforts to make your mother happy fail, you will feel guilty and inadequate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many experts on human behavior contend that you can't "make" anyone feel anything -- that each person is totally responsible for how he "chooses" to feel. I don't think that's true. I believe we do have an effect on the feelings of everyone we are connected to. But having an effect is not the same thing as being responsible for fixing those feelings. Just as you are responsible for finding ways to make yourself feel better when someone hurts you, your parents are responsible for finding their own ways to feel better when someone hurts them.</div>

<div class="line_en">False Beliefs, Painful Feelings</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When you base the majority of your life decisions on how they will make your parents feel, you are relinquishing free choice. If their feelings always come first, they are in the driver's seat of your life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Think about what other beliefs you may have that keep you from feeling like an effective adult with your parents. Add them to the list. This list will become part of a short exercise I'll ask you to do later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Self-defeating beliefs always lead to painful feelings. By examining your feelings, you can begin to understand both the beliefs that spawned them and the behaviors that result.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of us think our feelings are reactions to things that happen to us, things that come from outside of ourselves. But in reality, even the most extreme fear, pleasure, or pain grows out of some kind of belief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For example, you get very brave one day and tell your alcoholic father that you are no longer willing to be with him when he's drunk. He starts screaming about how ungrateful and disrespectful you are. You feel guilty. You may think your guilt is a result of your father's behavior, but that's only half the story. Before your feelings washed through you, certain beliefs were triggered in your mind -- beliefs you probably weren't aware of. In this case, these beliefs might have been: "children should never talk back to their parents," or, "my father has an illness and it's up to me to take care of him." Because you have not been true to these deep-seated beliefs, you react with guilt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Understanding the relationship between your beliefs and your feelings is an essential step toward putting a stop to self-defeating behavior!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When you are faced with a situation that calls for an emotional response, family beliefs run through your mind like an unconscious patter. Understanding that these beliefs almost always precede your feelings is more than an interesting psychological exercise.</div>

<div class="line_en">"BUT I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You may have gotten strong messages in your childhood that it wasn't safe to feel. Perhaps you were punished for expressing feelings, or perhaps your feelings were so painful that you pushed them deep into your unconscious in order to survive. Perhaps you had to convince yourself that you just didn't care, or perhaps you needed to prove to your parents that they couldn't get to you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As an adult it may be very difficult for you to turn your emotional faucets back on. The connection between powerful feelings and your past and current relationship with your parents may be especially difficult for you to see. The feelings I'm discussing throughout this book may seem foreign to you. Perhaps you describe yourself as cold or numb, or you believe that you don't have any feelings -- that you don't have much to offer in the way of love or caring. If so, your childhood feelings were probably very intense, and you required a great deal of protective defenses to make it into adulthood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We all have strong emotional reactions to our parents. Some of us are in touch with these feelings, but others protect themselves from the intensity of their emotions by burying them.</div>

<div class="line_en">If your feelings are deeply buried, you can use these checklists as a starting point to get in touch with them. You can also try to imagine what the feelings might be of someone else who has the same relationship to his parents as you have. Many people find that they simply cannot reach their feelings without therapy. Your feelings are not lost, they are just misplaced, and sometimes it takes professional help to reclaim them. But whatever it takes, you cannot do this work without connecting with your feelings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's important that you take it easy as you begin to allow some of your blocked feelings to surface. You may feel very upset for a period of time as your feelings come to life. Many people enter therapy expecting to feel better immediately. They are dismayed when they discover that usually they have to feel worse before they can feel better. This is emotional surgery, and as with any surgery, the wounds must be cleaned out before they heal, and it takes time for the pain to go away. But the pain is a sign that the healing process has started.</div>

<div class="line_en">Please add any feelings you have that aren't covered. These may include physical reactions to your parents. Physical reactions are often the language through which we express painful feelings, especially when it isn't safe to say them to the people we're upset with. We often say with our bodies what we can't or won't say with our mouths. The particular physical symptoms are influenced by such things as family medical history, predispositions or vulnerabilities in certain parts of your body, and your unique personality and emotional setup. It's not unusual for adult children of toxic parents to suffer headaches, stomachaches, muscle tension, fatigue, loss of appetite or compulsion to eat, sleep problems, and nausea. These reactions should never be discounted, and if they intensify to stress-related diseases such as cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disorders, they can be lethal. Therefore, it is essential that you seek medical help for any physical condition that persists, even if you are convinced that it is emotional in origin.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is not difficult to see how compliant behaviors keep you from being independent. But enmeshment through aggressive behaviors is less clear. These behaviors would appear to separate you from your parents. They create the illusion that you are fighting back rather than capitulating. In reality, aggressive behaviors still indicate enmeshment because of the intensity of your feelings; the repetitiveness and predictability of your reactions; and the fact that your behavior is not determined by your free choice, but rather by your defensive need to prove how separate you are.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm so ashamed. I'm middle-aged, been married three times, have a grown son, and my parents are still pulling my strings. Can you believe… I checked off nearly every belief and feeling on the lists. And talk about Ms. Compliant… When am I going to get it through my thick skull that my parents aren't ever going to change? They've always been cruel and unsupportive, and I guess they always will be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol, the model-turned-interior-designer who had been verbally abused by her father, was astounded when she added up the results of her checklists. She discovered that at age 52 she was still highly enmeshed with her parents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Compliance and aggression are merely two sides of the same behavioral coin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told Carol that feelings of shame and embarrassment are common for someone who considers herself an adult but suddenly sees that she's still controlled by her parents. We would all like to believe that we are independent adults making our own decisions about our own lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol probably was right: her parents weren't going to change. But she was. The first step in shaking off the destructive bonds is understanding what makes them so strong.</div>

<div class="line_en">Avoid taking confrontative action when your emotions are at fever pitch. Your perspective and judgment will be clouded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Remember, this is the beginning of a process, not an overnight cure. The preceding lists are just the beginning of your exploration. There are some very complex and often bewildering issues ahead. You don't want to dive into the water until you've checked for rocks beneath the surface. You can't change lifelong patterns overnight no matter how self-defeating they may be. What you can do is start to challenge your constricting beliefs and self-defeating behaviors and eventually discard them to allow your true self to emerge. But before you can recover your true self, you've got to know who you are.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like many of my clients, Carol reacted angrily to the realization that she was still enmeshed. She wanted to rush right out and challenge her parents. If you have that impulse, resist it. This is not the right time. Impulsive action almost always backfires.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is plenty of time to integrate your new awareness into your life. But first you've got to map out a plan of action.</div>
