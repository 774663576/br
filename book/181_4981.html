<div class="line_en">While the dwarf and the White Witch were saying this, miles away the Beavers and the children were walking on hour after hour into what seemed a delicious dream. Long ago they had left the coats behind them. And by now they had even stopped saying to one another, "Look! there's a kingfisher," or "I say, bluebells!" or "What was that lovely smell?" or "Just listen to that thrush!" They walked on in silence drinking it all in, passing through patches of warm sunlight into cool, green thickets and out again into wide mossy glades where tall elms raised the leafy roof far overhead, and then into dense masses of flowering currant and among hawthorn bushes where the sweet smell was almost overpowering.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been just as surprised as Edmund when they saw the winter vanishing and the whole wood passing in a few hours or so from January to May. They hadn't even known for certain (as the Witch did) that this was what would happen when Aslan came to Narnia. But they all knew that it was her spells which had produced the endless winter; and therefore they all knew when this magic spring began that something had gone wrong, and badly wrong, with the Witch's schemes. And after the thaw had been going on for some time they all realized that the Witch would no longer be able to use her sledge. After that they didn't hurry so much and they allowed themselves more rests and longer ones. They were pretty tired by now of course; but not what I'd call bitterly tired -- only slow and feeling very dreamy and quiet inside as one does when one is coming to the end of a long day in the open. Susan had a slight blister on one heel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们眼看冬天消失，整个森林在几小时内就从一月到了五月，也跟爱德蒙一样感到惊奇。他们甚至没有像妖婆那样肯定这是阿斯兰到了纳尼亚才会出现的事，但他们都知道是妖婆的咒语变出了没完没了的冬天；因此他们全知道这个不可思议的春天一开始，妖婆的阴谋诡计就失败了，而且大大失败了。融雪持续了一段时间，他们大家都明白妖婆再也不能用雪橇了。此后他们就不再匆匆忙忙赶路，也容许自己多休息几回，休息时间更长一些。他们眼下当然很疲劳；但不是那种所谓筋疲力尽——只是没精打采，觉得恍恍惚惚的，而且心里很平静，就像在户外待了漫长一天，终于到头时的感觉。苏珊一只脚后跟磨起了一个小水疱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not long now," said Mr Beaver, and began leading them uphill across some very deep, springy moss (it felt nice under their tired feet) in a place where only tall trees grew, very wide apart. The climb, coming at the end of the long day, made them all pant and blow. And just as Lucy was wondering whether she could really get to the top without another long rest, suddenly they were at the top. And this is what they saw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在不远了。”海狸先生说着开始带领他们上山，穿过一段深深的、松软的青苔（他们疲劳的双脚踩在上面倒觉得很舒服），那地方只稀稀拉拉长着一些高大的树木。在漫长的白天结束时爬山，大家都喘不过气来。露茜心里正在想，不好好休息一阵子，自己能不能爬上山顶；但突然间，他们就到山顶上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had left the course of the big river some time ago; for one had to turn a little to the right (that meant a little to the south) to reach the place of the Stone Table. Even if this had not been their way they couldn't have kept to the river valley once the thaw began, for with all that melting snow the river was soon in flood -- a wonderful, roaring, thundering yellow flood -- and their path would have been under water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们早就离开了那条大河的河道，因为必需稍稍往右转（就是说稍稍向南）才能到达石桌那儿。即使这条路不是他们该走的路，一旦融雪开始，他们也不能老沿着河谷走，因为有了那么多融雪，河里很快就发大水了——一股来势惊人、咆哮轰鸣的黄浊洪水——他们走的小路就会淹在水里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were on a green open space from which you could look down on the forest spreading as far as one could see in every direction -- except right ahead. There, far to the East, was something twinkling and moving. "By gum!" whispered Peter to Susan, "the sea!" In the very middle of this open hill-top was the Stone Table. It was a great grim slab of grey stone supported on four upright stones. It looked very old; and it was cut all over with strange lines and figures that might be the letters of an unknown language. They gave you a curious feeling when you looked at them. The next thing they saw was a pavilion pitched on one side of the open place. A wonderful pavilion it was -- and especially now when the light of the setting sun fell upon it -- with sides of what looked like yellow silk and cords of crimson and tent-pegs of ivory; and high above it on a pole a banner which bore a red rampant lion fluttering in the breeze which was blowing in their faces from the far-off sea. While they were looking at this they heard a sound of music on their right; and turning in that direction they saw what they had come to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站在一片绿油油的空地上，在那儿你可以俯瞰森林，除了正前方，目光所及都是绵延不绝的森林。东边远处，有什么东西闪闪发亮，还在晃动。“天哪！”彼得悄声对苏珊说，“大海！”山顶这块空地的正中就是石桌。那是一块很大的灰色石板，下面撑着四块笔直的石头。石桌看上去年代悠久，上面刻满了奇怪的线条和符号，可能是一种无名语言的字母吧。你看着这些符号．一种好奇的感觉就会油然而生。他们看到的第二件东西是空地一边搭起的一个帐篷，那是一个奇妙的帐篷——尤其是这会儿落日的余晖正照在帐篷上——帐篷面子看上去像杏黄缎子，深红的绳索，象牙色的帐篷桩；帐篷的支柱上，高高挂着一面绣着一只腾跃的红色狮子的旗子，正迎风飘扬，这阵从远处海面吹来的微风也轻拂着他们的脸。他们正看着这帐篷，只听见右面传来一阵音乐，便不由向那边转过身去，这才看见了他们特地来看的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But as for Aslan himself, the Beavers and the children didn't know what to do or say when they saw him. People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time. If the children had ever thought so, they were cured of it now. For when they tried to look at Aslan's face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great, royal, solemn, overwhelming eyes; and then they found they couldn't look at him and went all trembly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到阿斯兰，海狸夫妇和孩子们都不知道看见它时该怎么办、怎么说。没有到过纳尼亚的人往往认为决不会有好人让人见了害怕的。如果孩子们以前这么认为，眼下他们已经纠正了这种想法。因为当他们想看看阿斯兰的脸时，只看了一眼金色的鬃毛和那双威武、高贵、庄严、慑人的眼睛，他们就觉得自己不能正眼看它了，大家都不禁在发抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aslan stood in the centre of a crowd of creatures who had grouped themselves round him in the shape of a half-moon. There were Tree-Women there and Well-Women (Dryads and Naiads as they used to be called in our world) who had stringed instruments; it was they who had made the music. There were four great centaurs. The horse part of them was like huge English farm horses, and the man part was like stern but beautiful giants. There was also a unicorn, and a bull with the head of a man, and a pelican, and an eagle, and a great Dog. And next to Aslan stood two leopards of whom one carried his crown and the other his standard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯兰站在一群生物中间，它们围着它形成一个半月形。有树精和水精（在我们的世界里称为森林女神和水仙女），她们都有弦乐器；音乐就是她们演奏的。有四只巨大的人头马，身体像英国饲养场里的骏马，头部像严厉而俊美的巨人。还有一匹独角兽，一匹人头牛，一只鹈鹕，一只鹰和一条大狗。阿斯兰身边站着两头豹，一头拿着它的王冠，另一头举着它的旗帜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Aslan said nothing either to excuse Peter or to blame him but merely stood looking at him with his great unchanging eyes. And it seemed to all of them that there was nothing to be said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"All shall be done," said Aslan. "But it may be harder than you think." And then he was silent again for some time. Up to that moment Lucy had been thinking how royal and strong and peaceful his face looked; now it suddenly came into her head that he looked sad as well.

<div class="line_en">And Peter with his sword still drawn in his hand went with the Lion to the eastern edge of the hilltop. There a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs. That meant that the whole country below them lay in the evening light -- forest and hills and valleys and, winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river. And beyond all this, miles away, was the sea, and beyond the sea the sky, full of clouds which were just turning rose colour with the reflection of the sunset. But just where the land of Narnia met the sea -- in fact, at the mouth of the great river -- there was something on a little hill, shining. It was shining because it was a castle and of course the sunlight was reflected from all the windows which looked towards Peter and the sunset; but to Peter it looked like a great star resting on the seashore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得仍然一手握剑，跟着狮王一起来到山顶的东边。一幅美景出现在他们眼前。太阳已经落在他们背后。他们下面的整个国土都笼罩在暮色中——森林和小山，山谷，以及像条银蛇般蜿蜒流过的大河的下游。那边几英里以外是大海，大海以外是天空，落日映照下满是玫瑰色的云层。但就在纳尼亚国土近海的地方——其实就是那条大河的入海口——有什么东西屹立在一座小山上闪闪发光。因为这是一座城堡，朝彼得这边的窗户当然都映出落日的余辉；不过彼得觉得城堡就像海岸上的一颗大星星。">查看中文翻译</div>

Let the Prince win his spurs," he did understand, and set off running as hard as he could to the pavilion. And there he saw a dreadful sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得一时不明白。后来，他看见所有的生物都拥上前来，只听得阿斯兰挥挥爪子说：“退下！让王子立个头功吧。”他才明白，于是他飞快地奔向帐篷。在那儿，他看见了一幕可怕的情景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Naiads and Dryads were scattering in every direction. Lucy was running towards him as fast as her short legs would carry her and her face was as white as paper. Then he saw Susan make a dash for a tree, and swing herself up, followed by a huge grey beast. At first Peter thought it was a bear. Then he saw that it looked like an Alsatian, though it was far too big to be a dog. Then he realized that it was a wolf -- a wolf standing on its hind legs, with its front paws against the tree-trunk, snapping and snarling. All the hair on its back stood up on end. Susan had not been able to get higher than the second big branch. One of her legs hung down so that her foot was only an inch or two above the snapping teeth. Peter wondered why she did not get higher or at least take a better grip; then he realized that she was just going to faint and that if she fainted she would fall off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水仙女和森林女神正四下奔逃。露茜脸色苍白，撒开两条短腿朝他跑来。接着他看见苏珊向一棵树冲去，纵身爬上了树，后面有一头灰色的巨兽在追她。开头彼得以为那是一只熊。后来他看出这头野兽很像一条德国狼狗，然而又比狗大多了。后来他才想到这是一匹狼——一匹狼后腿站着，前爪扑在树干上又咬又吼，背上的毛根根竖起。苏珊只攀上第二根大树枝，再也没法爬高。她一条腿吊在下面，这只脚离开乱咬的狼牙只有一两英寸。彼得不知道她为什么不爬得高一点，至少也要抓牢些嘛；后来他才明白她快晕过去了，如果她晕过去，那就会摔下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter did not feel very brave; indeed, he felt he was going to be sick. But that made no difference to what he had to do. He rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side. That stroke never reached the Wolf. Quick as lightning it turned round, its eyes flaming, and its mouth wide open in a howl of anger. If it had not been so angry that it simply had to howl it would have got him by the throat at once. As it was -- though all this happened too quickly for Peter to think at all -- he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword, as hard as he could, between the brute's forelegs into its heart. Then came a horrible, confused moment like something in a nightmare. He was tugging and pulling and the Wolf seemed neither alive nor dead, and its bared teeth knocked against his forehead, and everything was blood and heat and hair. A moment later he found that the monster lay dead and he had drawn his sword out of it and was straightening his back and rubbing the sweat off his face and out of his eyes. He felt tired all over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得并不觉得自己十分勇敢；说真的，他感到自己快要呕吐了。不过这并不影响他的使命，他笔直冲向那头猛兽，瞄准它肋间猛刺一剑。这一下子并没刺中那匹狼。它闪电般转过身来，眼睛凶焰灼人，嘴巴张得老大，狂嚎一阵。要不是它怒气冲冲，非得嚎叫一通才痛快，它就会立刻咬住彼得的喉咙了。事实上——尽管这一切都太快，彼得根本来不及想——他只来得及弯下身子，使尽浑身力气，把剑刺进那猛兽前腿之间，刺中了心脏。接下来一段工夫又可怕又混乱，就像恶梦中的情景。他用力拖啊，拉啊，那匹狼既不像死了，也不像活着，露出一口利牙磕在他的额头上，一切都沾满了血、热气和皮毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
